# Stirring Scaled Ornament
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon's scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can't be [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) or to end those conditions on itself.
