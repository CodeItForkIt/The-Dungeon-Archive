# Biza's Breath
*Adventuring gear, poison (inhaled)*  

- **Properties**: [Poison](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
