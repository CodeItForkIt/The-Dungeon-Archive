# Zabou
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 10 gp

Zabou mushrooms feed on offal and the rotting wood of dead trees. If handled carefully, a zabou can be picked or uprooted without causing it to release its spores. If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
