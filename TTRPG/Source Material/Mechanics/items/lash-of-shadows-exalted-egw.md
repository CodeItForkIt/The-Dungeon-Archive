# Lash of Shadows (Exalted)
*Weapon ([whip](Mechanics/items/whip.md)), artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Finesse](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Reach](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Vestige of Divergence](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.

## Sentience

The Lash of Shadows is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.

## Personality

A mad [marilith](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md) named Sizlifeth lives within the Lash of Shadows. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.

## Dormant

The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
- You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:  
-     - **Dead Eyes.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. While [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature is [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded).    
        - **Serpent Venom.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes `3d6` poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.    

> [!note] Betrayer Artifact Properties
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [minor beneficial](Mechanics/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and one [minor detrimental](Mechanics/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [minor beneficial](Mechanics/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and an additional [minor detrimental](Mechanics/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [major beneficial](Mechanics/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.

## Awakened

When the whip reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.  
- The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 15.  
- The weapon gains a new poison option called Ghoul's Blood. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. While [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature is [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

## Exalted

When the whip reaches an exalted state, it gains the following additional properties:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.  
- The saving throw DC for the weapon's poisons increases to 17.  
- The weapon gains a new poison option called Cockatrice Tears. A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained). It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for 24 hours.
