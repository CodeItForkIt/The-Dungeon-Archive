# Sleep Grenade
*Explosive*  


As an action, a character can throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. With a grenade launcher, the character can propel the grenade up to 120 feet away.

This grenade releases a cloud of soporific mist that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere, then dissipates. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition for 1 hour. The condition ends on a creature early if the creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
