# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
