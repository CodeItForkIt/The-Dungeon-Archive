# Hat of Vermin
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](Mechanics/items/img/hat-of-vermin.webp#right)


This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [Magic](Mechanics/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [Bat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/bat-xphb.md), a [Frog](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/frog-xphb.md), or a [Rat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rat-xphb.md). The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [Indifferent [Attitude]](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/indifferent-attitude-xphb.md) toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
