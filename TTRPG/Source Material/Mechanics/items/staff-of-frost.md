You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [cone of cold](Mechanics/spells/cone-of-cold.md) (5 charges), [fog cloud](Mechanics/spells/fog-cloud.md) (1 charge), [ice storm](Mechanics/spells/ice-storm.md) (4 charges), or [wall of ice](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-ice.md) (4 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
