# Imbued Wood Focus
*Wondrous item, spellcasting focus, common (requires attunement)*  


An imbued wood focus is a rod, staff, or wand cut from a tree infused with extraplanar energy. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this as a spellcasting focus.

When you cast a damage-dealing spell using this item as your spellcasting focus, you gain a +1 bonus to one damage roll of the spell, provided the damage is of the type associated with the item's wood. The types of wood and their associated damage types are listed in the Imbued Wood Focus table.
