# Fenthras (Dormant)
*Weapon ([longbow](Mechanics/items/longbow.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Range**: 150/600
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Heavy](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed), [Vestige of Divergence](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This gorgeous [longbow](Mechanics/items/longbow.md) made of everbark from the Fey Realm flexes and shifts like a living entity. It is said to have been wielded by the legendary ranger [Vex'ahlia](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/vexahlia-tdcsr.md) against great evils.

## Dormant

While Fenthras is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you make an attack with Fenthras, you can declare it an oracle shot, allowing you to experience the area around the arrow using your normal senses for 10 minutes. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when a creature is killed by an attack using this weapon, a six-foot-tall tree rapidly grows out of the corpse over the next minute. The tree is rooted in the ground to make the body difficult to move, but does not permanently damage the corpse or its organs.
