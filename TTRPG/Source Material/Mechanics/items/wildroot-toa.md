# Wildroot
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 25 gp

Introducing the juice of a wildroot into a [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature's bloodstream (for example, by rubbing it on an open wound) rids the creature of the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition. Once used in this way, a wildroot loses this property.
