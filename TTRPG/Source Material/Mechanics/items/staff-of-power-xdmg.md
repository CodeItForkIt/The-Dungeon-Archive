## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `2d8 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll ``. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains `1d8 + 2` charges.

## Retributive Strike

You can take a [Magic](Mechanics/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in an explosion that fills a 30-foot [Emanation [Area of Effect]](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take Force damage equal to 16 times the number of charges in the staff . Each other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Force damage equal to 4 times the number of charges in the staff . On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
