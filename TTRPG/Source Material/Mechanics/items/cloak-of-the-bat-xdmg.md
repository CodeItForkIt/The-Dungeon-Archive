# Cloak of the Bat
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



While wearing this cloak, you have [Advantage](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks. In an area of [Dim Light](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [Fly Speed](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in [Dim Light](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you lose this [Fly Speed](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md).

While wearing the cloak in an area of [Dim Light](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](Mechanics/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can cast [Polymorph](Mechanics/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) on yourself, shape-shifting into a [Bat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/bat-xphb.md). While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
