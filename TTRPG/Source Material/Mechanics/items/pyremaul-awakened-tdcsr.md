# Pyremaul (Awakened)
*Weapon ([maul](Mechanics/items/maul.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed), [Vestige of Divergence](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)

Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by "Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon", somewhere beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains".

## Dormant

While Pyremaul is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d6` fire damage.

Additionally, you can choose to have this weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (no action required).

## Awakened

When Pyremaul reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack rolls increases to +2.  
- The extra fire damage dealt by the weapon increases to `2d6`.  
- As an action, you can slam Pyremaul into the ground to cast the [burning hands](Mechanics/spells/burning-hands.md) spell at 2nd level (save DC 15). You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.  
- Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).
