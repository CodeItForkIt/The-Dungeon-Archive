# Magician's Judge
*Weapon ([greatsword](Mechanics/items/greatsword.md)), rare*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

An executioner's blade from the "Age of Arcanum", this magic [greatsword](Mechanics/items/greatsword.md) is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as "Wildemount" and "Issylra", a few such blades have found their way to Tal'Dorei.

If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.

Once you cast [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) using this weapon, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
