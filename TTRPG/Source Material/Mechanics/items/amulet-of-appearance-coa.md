# Amulet of Appearance
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


Your armor, weapons, and other equipment always shine as if just polished. Even if you're wounded, your wounds do not appear to others. You're immune to the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) and [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) conditions, as these would otherwise ruin your elegant appearance. However, whenever you would otherwise have been affected by one of these conditions, a random non-evil Humanoid on the Material Plane whom you have previously met gets the condition instead. You know this.
