# Inescapable Lash
*Weapon ([whip](Mechanics/items/whip.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Extended Reach](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Extended%20Reach), [Finesse](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Finesse)
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This braided cord is dull bronze in color, ends in a splayed set of three barbs, and gleams like metal under any light. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has a reach of 20 feet. When you hit a creature or object using this whip, you can attempt to [grapple](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Grapple) the target as a bonus action.

While you have a creature [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) using this whip, you can use your action to either pull the creature up to 20 feet toward you, or cause the creature to be [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until you let go of the whip. A creature [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) in this way can escape by making a successful Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check as an action. The DC of this check equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.
