# Potion of Mind Control (humanoid)
*Potion, rare*  


When you drink a potion of mind control, you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.

A potion of mind control produces the effect of a [dominate person](TTRPG/Source%20Material/Mechanics/spells/dominate-person.md) spell. If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no [concentration](TTRPG/Source%20Material/Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required on your part. The [charmed](TTRPG/Source%20Material/Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
