# Primal Amulet



This beaded jade necklace bears an ancient symbol of the River Heralds. When worn, the primal amulet allows its wearer to cast [speak with animals](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-animals.md), [locate object](Mechanics/spells/locate-object.md), and [pass without trace](Mechanics/spells/pass-without-trace.md). Once the amulet has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
