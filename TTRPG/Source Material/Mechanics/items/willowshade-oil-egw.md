# Willowshade Oil
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 30 gp

A dark blue oil can be extracted from the rare fruit of the willowshade plant. A creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for less than 1 minute, causing the [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature's next turn.
