# Conch of Safe Rest


- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to blow this pearlescent conch like a [horn](Mechanics/items/horn.md), creating an effect identical with that of a [Leomund's tiny hut](Mechanics/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md) spell. The conch disappears once the spell takes effect. The effect ends if you leave the spell's area.
