# Wreath of the Prism (Dormant)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige of Divergence](Mechanics/Rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)

This loop of golden thorns is inset with dozens of gems representing the five colors of Tiamat.

## Dormant

While wearing the wreath in its dormant state, you have [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision), wearing the wreath increases the range of your [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) by 60 feet.

When you hit a beast, dragon, or monstrosity of challenge rating 5 or lower with an attack, or when you grapple it, you can use the wreath to cast [dominate monster](Mechanics/spells/dominate-monster.md) on the creature (save DC 13). On a successful save, the target is immune to the power of the wreath for 24 hours. On a failure, a shimmering, golden image of the wreath appears as a collar around the target's neck or as a crown on its head (your choice) until it is no longer [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the spell. If you use the wreath to charm a second creature, the first spell immediately ends. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.
