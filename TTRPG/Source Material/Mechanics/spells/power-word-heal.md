# Power Word Heal
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*9th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
