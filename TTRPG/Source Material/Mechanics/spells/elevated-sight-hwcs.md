# Elevated Sight
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cast your eyes skyward, granting you sight from a higher vantage point. You project your vision to see through an invisible sensor which appears in a spot up to 120 feet above you. You can see through the sensor as if you were flying, granting a full 360 degree view from its location.

The sensor moves with you, retaining its height in relation to you. You can use a bonus action to adjust the sensor's height, but only to a maximum of 120 feet above you.

While looking through this sensor you are [blind](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), though you can switch between seeing through the sensor or through your own eyes at any time during your turn.
