# Draconic Transformation
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a statuette of a dragon, worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a roar, you draw on the magic of dragons to transform yourself, taking on draconic features. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- **Blindsight.** You have [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.  
- **Breath Weapon.** When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d8` force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Wings.** Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.
