# [Elemental Locus](Mechanics\bestiary\elemental/elemental-locus-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 157*  

*The ground ripples and tears as rocks fall, jets of flame erupt, and howling winds rage around a rocky creature.*

## Spirit of the Land

Elemental loci are living spirits inhabiting or embodying tracts of land and geographical features. They are the ultimate personification of natureâ€”the land itself come to life. They vary in size from small hills to entire ridge lines, with no discernible pattern to where they take root.

## Stubborn Nature

Elemental loci are fiercely protective of their chosen location. They tolerate no interference in the natural order and challenge all who despoil the land, be they mortal, monster, or god.

> [!note] Elemental Loci in Midgard
> 
> Among the Tamasheq, the elemental loci are cherished as minor deities, nearly as powerful as the Wind Lords themselves. The sorcerers of Kush have tried to capture and enslave loci for decades; thus far without success, but they grow bolder (and closer to their goal) with each attempt.

- "desc": "The elemental locus magically creates up to 2d6 mephits or 1 Elemental\
    \ with a challenge rating of 5 or lower. The Elementals arrive at the start of\
    \ the locus's next turn, acting as allies of the locus and obeying its spoken\
    \ commands. The locus can create only Elementals that share an element with a\
    \ terrain feature comprising at least 100,000 square feet of the locus's bound\
    \ land. For example, a desert-bound locus can't create a water-based Elemental,\
    \ unless its bound desert contains an oasis or other source of water around the\
    \ size of a small pond. The Elementals remain for 1 hour, until the locus dies,\
    \ or until the locus dismisses them as a bonus action. The locus can have any\
    \ number of Elementals under its control at one time, provided the combined total\
    \ CR of the Elementals is no higher than 8."
