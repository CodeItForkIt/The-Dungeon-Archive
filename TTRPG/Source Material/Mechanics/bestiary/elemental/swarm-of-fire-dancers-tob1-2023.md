# [Swarm of Fire Dancers](Mechanics\bestiary\elemental/swarm-of-fire-dancers-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 354*  

*A swirling mass of tiny, blue flames dances with the likeness of a skull embedded in each little, flickering fire.*

## Stunted Elementals

Fire dancers are tiny fire elementals. Speculation varies whether they're simply immature or somehow stunted. They may be castoffs from larger, fiery elemental beings. A single, solitary fire dancer is no more than a semi-sentient spark with a fragment of life and lofty but unrealistic ambitions. In large numbers, they're a menace.

## Unite and Grow Strong

Larger fire elementals are usually content merely to exist on their plane of origin. Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal qualitiesâ€”they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands join together, though, the result is an inferno. Each fire dancer shapes itself into the likeness of a creature's (typically humanoid) skull to cause fear in its victims.

## Shared Goals

Lone fire dancers have some individuality, and like-minded fire dancers gather together in swarms to accomplish shared goals. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters who summon or interact with swarms of fire dancers know to quickly determine the swarm's goal and use that to manipulate it. They must be careful to maintain the upper hand, though, for these creatures are surly allies at the best of times.
