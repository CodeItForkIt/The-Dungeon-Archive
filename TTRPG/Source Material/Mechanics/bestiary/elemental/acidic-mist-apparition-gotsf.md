    \ object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage\
    \ for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature,\
    \ that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same\
    \ damage and be knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).\n\nIf the\
    \ saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and\
    \ isn't flung away or knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
