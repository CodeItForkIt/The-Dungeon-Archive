# [Liosalfar](Mechanics\bestiary\elemental/liosalfar-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 256*  

*The curtain of rippling colors assumes a humanoid form. Its kaleidoscope body shifts and glitters with mesmeric patterns.*

Sometimes known as "light elves" because they assume a vaguely elvish shape, these enigmatic elementals make their home at the edge of the world, where reality bends and physical laws unravel. Liosalfars' mutable bodies are composed entirely of shifting colors. Among themselves, they communicate through flashing patterns and hues, but they talk to others in an echoing, choral tone that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere around them.

## Servants of Fate

Their aims often seem inconsequential or simply baffling, but they've also sundered mountains and toppled kingdoms. Many believe liosalfars are agents of Fate, while others believe their motivations are an alien aesthetic or for their own amusement. Those who've spoken with liosalfars say they talk as if all existence was a sea of patterns and colors to be set in pleasing shapes.

## Enemies of the Ramag

Liosalfars have a longstanding rivalry with the portal-making ramags, whom they despise as "corruptors of the patterns."

- "desc": "The liosalfar causes the light radiating from its body to shift color and\

    \ and that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ until the display ends. The liosalfar must take a bonus action on its subsequent\

    \ a creature is also [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated),\

    \ ends for a [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature if it takes\
