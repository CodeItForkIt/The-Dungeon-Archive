- "desc": "The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6\

    \ no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](Mechanics/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md),\

    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](Mechanics/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](Mechanics/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell\
    \ one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such\
    \ genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on\
