# [Chronalmental](Mechanics\bestiary\elemental/chronalmental-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 56*  

*A chronalmental is difficult to pin down, and it may appear as a large man-shaped absence in the air that reveals first a field of stars, then a contorted rainbow of colored bands, then a brilliant white light, strobing in and out of existence.*

## Fluid as Time

Shifting between the past, present, and future, chronalmentals are formed from temporal energy. They flow like sand in an hourglass and exist between the ticks of a clock. The first chronalmentals were forged from extra time left over from the beginning of the universe. Many served as shock troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or abandoned to drift in the Astral Plane or in the void between the stars.

## Stewards of Calamity

Locations of historical significance—both past and future—attract chronalmentals. They have a fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.

## Environmental Chaos

Whatever the terrain, the environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental. Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments. These changes occur randomly, a side effect of a chronalmental's presence. Things return to normal when they depart.
