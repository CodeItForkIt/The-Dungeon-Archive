# [Rime Worm](Mechanics\bestiary\elemental/rime-worm-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 308*  

*The long, crusty slug sparkles like ice, and long tendrils dangle from its gaping mouth.*

## Ice Burrowers

The rime worm's tendrils help it burrow through ice and snow as well as absorb sustenance from prey. Their pale, almost translucent, skin is coated with ice crystals, making them difficult to spot in their snowy habitat.

## Spray Black Ice

The worms are fierce hunters, and their abilities to spray skewers of ice and freeze their prey make them extremely dangerous.
