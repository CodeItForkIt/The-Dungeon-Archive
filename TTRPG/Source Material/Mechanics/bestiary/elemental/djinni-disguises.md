- "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
    \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](Mechanics/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md),\
    \ [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](Mechanics/spells/thunderwave.md),\
    \ [disguise self](Mechanics/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer duration\
    \ than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day each: [conjure elemental](Mechanics/spells/conjure-elemental.md)\
    \ ([air elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) only), [creation](Mechanics/spells/creation.md),\
    \ [gaseous form](Mechanics/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md),\
    \ [major image](Mechanics/spells/major-image.md), [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md)\n\
    \n3/day each: [create food and water](Mechanics/spells/create-food-and-water.md)\
    \ (can create wine instead of water), [tongues](Mechanics/spells/tongues.md),\
    \ [wind walk](Mechanics/spells/wind-walk.md), [true polymorph](Mechanics/spells/true-polymorph.md)\
    \ (mightier genies only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](Mechanics/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](Mechanics/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell\
    \ one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such\
    \ genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on\
    \ other creatures and objects as well."
  "name": "Disguises"
"actions":
- "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's\
    \ choice)."
  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the\
    \ whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
    \ [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind move\
    \ with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature can\
    \ use its action to free a creature [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
    \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
