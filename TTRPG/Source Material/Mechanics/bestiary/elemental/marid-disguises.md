  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](Mechanics/spells/disguise-self.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](Mechanics/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell\
    \ one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such\
    \ genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on\

    \ is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed\
    \ nor knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
