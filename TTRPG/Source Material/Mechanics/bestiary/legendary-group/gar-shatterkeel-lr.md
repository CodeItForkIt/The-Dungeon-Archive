# Gar Shatterkeel

## Lair actions
_Source: Locathah Rising_

Gar can employ lair actions while he's within the coral mountain.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar Shatterkeel takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Gar can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Gar may teleport anywhere within the coral mountain, bringing up to five willing creatures with him.  
- The coral in a 60-foot radius grows rapidly around creatures inside the coral mountain. Each creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or become [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained). Restrained creatures can take an action on their turn to make a DC 18 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to free themselves. This effect lasts for 1 minute unless dispelled (it counts as a 6th level spell), and doesn't require Gar to maintain [concentration](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration). Gar Shatterkeel and any creatures he designates are immune to this effect.  
- Up to five corpses that Gar can see within 60 feet rise up as [drowned blades](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/drowned-blade-gos.md) and attack anyone Gar directs them to on his turn.
