*The giant's hair and beard are plaited with rings and other bits of decorative stone and metal, and it carries a large, rune-inscribed hammer.*

## Forge Masters

Greedy and aggressively competitive, thursir dwell in vast caverns under frozen mountains where they labor to forge chains, armor, and massive engines of war. Smaller than many giants, thursir have a natural affinity for metalworking. Armor or weapons forged by a thursir giant are of the highest quality, and other giants often seek thursir smiths to outfit their people in times of strife.

## Enormous Appetites

When not toiling at the forge, these giants entertain themselves with gluttonous feasts and boisterous wrestling competitions, or they raid human settlements for food and valuables.

## Divided Society

Female thursir rarely leave thursir dwellings, tending the family and hearth and performing much of a community's labor, while male thursir spend their time crafting, metalworking, and going to war. However, female thursir have the most affinity for magic and make up the bulk of the thursir's priesthood and spellcasters. Priestesses hold especially high standing in thursir society and often operate as valued advisors to clan leadership or accompany the most powerful units of warriors into battle, tending wounds and boosting morale.
