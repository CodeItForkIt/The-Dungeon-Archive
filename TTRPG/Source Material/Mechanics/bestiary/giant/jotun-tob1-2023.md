*The earth shudders with every footfall of this massive giant.*

## Foes of the Gods

Tall enough to look a titan in the eye and strong enough to wrestle a dragon, jotun giants are the lords of giantkind and the immortal enemies of the gods. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and glaciers throughout the north. As foes of the northern gods, jotun giants plot to regain their former status as lords of creation. Many know ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and the most powerful among them straddle the line between mortal and demigod.

## Contests and Challenges

Like many giants, jotun enjoy a challenge. Only the mightiest heroes can challenge a jotun's might in physical combat, and most resort to cunning or trickery to defeat a jotun. However, jotun giants are no fools and catch on to trickery quickly.
