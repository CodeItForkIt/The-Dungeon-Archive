## Underworld Godlings

Gugs are giants of the underworld that enjoy smashing and devouring lesser creatures. Their burbling and grunting speech displays a surprising and malign intelligence to those who can understand it. Gugs are occasionally worshipped by tribes of derro, and their strange underworld cities are filled with esoteric monoliths and constructs.

## Nocturnal Raiders

While gugs were banished into the underworld by forgotten gods long ago, they regularly flout this prohibition by raiding the surface by night. They also spend much time in the Ethereal Plane, and some gug spellcasters travel the planes with entourages of fext or noctiny.

## Prey on Ghouls

Gugs devour ghouls and darakhul as their preferred food. When these are not available, they seem to prefer carrion and particular varieties of psychotropic mushrooms, as well as something that is best described as candied bats.
