# [Degenerate Titan](Mechanics\bestiary\giant/degenerate-titan-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 362*  

*This giant retains a look of daunting power despite its stooped bearing, tattered clothing, and pieces of slapdash armor strapped on wherever it fits.*

## Haunt Ruins

The degenerate descendants of ancient titans haunt the ruins where their cities once flourished. These descendants hunt for any living thing to eat, including each other, and sometimes chase after herds of goats or other animals for miles. While they are easily distracted, they always find their way home unerringly.

## Insane and Moody

Degenerate titans are prone to erratic actions and unexpected mood shifts. They are fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary as if the statues were gods. Their lairs are filled with items scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodge-podge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.

## Primal Power

Degenerate titans cannot command magical words of power like their ancestors, but they retain a connection to the natural world, allowing them to tap into the earth's latent mystic power to generate strange geomancy. These devolved misfits may have lost most of their former gifts, but what remains are primal powers that tap, without subtlety or skill, into the fundamental building blocks of the world.
