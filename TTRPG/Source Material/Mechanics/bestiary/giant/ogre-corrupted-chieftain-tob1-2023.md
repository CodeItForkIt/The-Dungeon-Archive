# [Ogre Corrupted Chieftain](Mechanics\bestiary\giant/ogre-corrupted-chieftain-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 289*  

*Spikes adorn the green skin of this large ogre, and it brandishes a nail-studded club.*

Twisted by wild magic, fiendish power, or arcane disease, the corrupted chieftain has turned its mutation into an advantage. The corruption within makes this chieftain stronger and more savage than the ogres it bullies and commands.

## Changed Form

The power that changed the corrupted chieftain's body caused its skin to toughen and produce dozens of bony spikes. It also caused the chieftain to become stronger, hardier, and more imposing than its ogre kin, solidifying its position as a clan's chieftain.

## Powerful Leader

Though the corrupted chieftain remains as tactical as it was before coming into contact with the force that changed it, the power coursing through its veins gives it uncanny sway over other ogres. The chieftain can belt out orders without receiving grumbles and can even imbue a measure of its power into its underlings.
