# [Zimwi](Mechanics\bestiary\giant/zimwi-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 402*  

*This swift-moving, lanky humanoid has long arms ending in wicked claws and jaws that open impossibly wide.*

## Swift as Horses

Distantly related to trolls, the swift and nimble zimwi are a plague upon grasslands. They are constantly hungry, ill-tempered and capable of running down horses, leading many zimwi to attack large caravans for food.

## Always Starving

Most zimwi attacks are driven by hunger. The stomach of a zimwi is larger than its body, extending extra-dimensionally and driving the zimwi nearly insane with constant hunger, leaving the zimwi always feeling as if it is starving to death. Because of their endless hunger and low intelligence, zimwi have little awareness of the course of a battle. Losing means only that they have not eaten. As long as they continue to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until death comes to them or all of their prey.

## Stomachs of Holding

The extradimensional pouch within a zimwi's stomach makes the stomach serviceable as a bag of holding if treated and enchanted properly. The harder part is relieving the zimwi of its prize.
