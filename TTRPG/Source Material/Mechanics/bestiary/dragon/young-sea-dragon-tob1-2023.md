## Divine Dragons

Sea dragons are the children of the ocean and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they might be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea. Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.

## Shipwreck Art

Sea dragons love collecting treasure. They especially prize the sunken, treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon's lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.

## Sunken Memorials

A sea dragon's lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.

> [!note] Priests of Seggotan
> 
> Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea. As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting variant. Sea dragons favor spells that manipulate water or the weather, emulate storms, deal lightning or cold damage, divine the future, or conjure sea creatures to fight alongside the dragon.

> [!note] Sea Dragons in Midgard
> 
> Sea dragons are the offspring of Seggotan, the dragon god of time and the sea. A sea dragon shares its god's idea that everything in the sea is the property of Seggotan, and they expect lesser beings to respect that truth. The sea dragons are among the most powerful allies of the Mharoti Empire, securing seaways and acting as a communion point for the tidal priests. Thankfully for the Empire's enemies, the most ancient sea dragons are too consumed with contemplation of time and their inscrutable duties in the depths of the ocean to make war.
