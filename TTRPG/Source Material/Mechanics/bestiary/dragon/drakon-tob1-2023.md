# [Drakon](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/drakon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 147*  

*These winged snakes are coastal beasts and sometimes confused with true dragons or wyverns. They are neither, but quite deadly in their own right.*

## Searing Acid and Dissolving Gaze

The gaze of these winged snakes can paralyze and dissolve their victims. Drakon fangs do not deliver venom; volatile acid constantly burbles up from a drakon's stomach and enhances its attacks. A caustic drool clings to creatures they bite, and drakons can also belch clouds of searing vapor. Their lairs reek with acidic vapors and droplets of searing liquid.

## Coastal Beasts

Drakons lair along warm, largely uninhabited coasts, where they explore the shores and the coastal shelf, spending as much time above the waves as under them. Fortunately, they rarely travel far inland.
