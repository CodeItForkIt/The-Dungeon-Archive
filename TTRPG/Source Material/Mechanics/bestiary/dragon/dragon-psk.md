# [Dragon](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/dragon-psk.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 29*  

Dragons are the apex predators of the skies. They are usually found in rural areas, avoiding the crowds of air ships and thopters found above the cities of Kaladesh. Their favorite prey are the sky whales that drift through the aethersphere, but they also hunt leviathans, wurms, hydras, drakes, giantsâ€”and airships.

Dragons typically hunt by perching on a promontory or hilltop, remaining perfectly still as they wait for prey to come into view. With a single snap of its powerful wings, a dragon can launch itself into the air with lightning speed, hurtling toward its target like a deadly arrow.

Dragons resemble a cross between a lizard and a tiger, with powerful feline bodies covered in striped fur, reptilian heads crowned with long horns, and enormous leathery wings that propel them through the sky at tremendous speed. Their chests are adorned with elaborate patterns resembling fine filigree.

The [red dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) statistics work well for the dragons of Kaladesh, though dragons rarely reach ancient age on that plane. They can spew great blasts of flame, but a dragon's preferred method of assault is to hold flame in its mouth as it attacks. This counts as a use of the dragon's breath weapon, but the dragon makes a special bite attack. On a hit, the bite attack deals its normal piercing damage plus the fire damage from the dragon's breath weapon, with no saving throw.
