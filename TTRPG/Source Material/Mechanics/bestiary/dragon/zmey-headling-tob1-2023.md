# [Zmey Headling](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/zmey-headling-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 404*  

*Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands upright, its long tail thrashing from side to side as it walks.*

Hunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two rolesâ€”vicious terror and nature's protector.

## Claws of the Forest

Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these lesser dragons, while others believe zmeys have pacts with certain druid circles.

## Voracious Headlings

A zmey's head doesn't die when severed from its body. Within days, it becomes a miniature zmey, developing into a full-grown zmey after two months. Voracious appetite fuels this growth. Coating the head or headling in the first month of life prevents this growth.
