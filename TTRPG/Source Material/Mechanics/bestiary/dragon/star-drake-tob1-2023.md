# [Star Drake](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/star-drake-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 146*  

*Twinkling motes of light move around the mottled, metallic scales of this dragon's body. Light reflections twinkle like starlight across its metallic scales.*

## Returned Travelers

A drake's curiosity sometimes drives it to seek experiences beyond its plane, and it finds companions with which it travels the multiverse. Such drakes return clearly changed in appearance, demeanor, and ability. Regardless of which type of drake embarked on the journey, the creature always returns as a star drake.

## Mortal Protectors

Star drakes consider themselves protectors of the Material Plane. They view those from other planes as meddlers in the affairs of humanoid races, regarding fiends and celestials as equally threatening. Star drakes might negotiate with, drive off, or destroy such meddlers.

## Unlikely Allies

Inexplicably, planewatchers can recognize when a drake that is exploring the planes is in the process of becoming a star drake, and they typically leave these drakes to their exploring. After a drake's metamorphosis, planewatchers often aid the drake, seeing it as a sort of kindred spirit.
