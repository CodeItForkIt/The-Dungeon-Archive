# [Young Time Dragon](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/young-time-dragon-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 51*  

These sleek dragons harness the power of time to manipulate the past, present, and future. Time dragon wyrmlings are born with shining scales and have horns that are barely more than nubs. As they master the flow of time, their horns grow with branching, rainbow-hued veins suggestive of time's paths and possibilities. Ancient time dragons can create temporal gates connected to specific times and places in the multiverse. Using these, they and allied creatures can travel anywhere in time to affect fate-determining moments or to banish threats beyond the flow of time. As a result of their ability to travel between ages, time dragons often seem unstuck from the usual flow of time and have a flexible view of what is, what was, and what will be.

Time dragons prize historical records, objects representative of lost cultures, and treasures from long-gone creators. They are fascinated by time-manipulation magic and forgotten knowledge. Those who stumble upon a time dragon's hoard might find invaluable historical information from eras past.
