# [Mithral Dragon Wyrmling](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/mithral-dragon-wyrmling-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 123*  

*Light glints off the dragon's glossy scales, shining silver-white. Its tiny wings folded flush against its body open like a fan and expose shimmering, diaphanous membranes. Its narrow head, with bare slits for its eyes and nostrils, sits at the end of a slender neck atop an impossibly thin frame*.

## Rage in Youth

Younger mithral dragons raid and pillage as heavily as any chromatic dragon, driven largely by greed to acquire a worthy hoard, though they are less likely to kill for sport or out of cruelty. In adulthood and old age, however, mithral dragons are less concerned with material wealth and more inclined to value friendship, knowledge, and a peaceful life pursuing interesting goals.

## Peacemakers

Adult and older mithral dragons are diplomats and arbitrators by temperament (some dragons cynically call them referees). They enjoy bringing some peace to warring factions. Among all dragons, their strict neutrality and ability to negate magic make them well suited to these vital roles.

> [!note] Mithral Dragons in Midgard
> 
> Mithral dragons are rebellious dragons who once sought to make peace between chromatic and metallic dragons. Having failed in that, they declared themselves neutral and now seek opportunities to make peace elsewhere. They are the only dragons that advocate against the perpetual war of the Dragon Empire, and occasionally serve as mercenaries against the Mharoti.
