# [Zmey](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/zmey-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 403*  

*Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands upright, its long tail thrashing from side to side as it walks.*

Hunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two roles—vicious terror and nature's protector.

## Claws of the Forest

Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these lesser dragons, while others believe zmeys have pacts with certain druid circles.

## Voracious Headlings

A zmey's head doesn't die when severed from its body. Within days, it becomes a miniature zmey, developing into a full-grown zmey after two months. Voracious appetite fuels this growth. Coating the head or headling in the first month of life prevents this growth.

## A Zmey's Lair

Zmeys make their lairs in the deepest parts of the forest. They plant and grow trees into "caves" with satellite "rooms" within their lair.

    \ flight.  \n- Invigorate Headlings. One severed zmey head the zmey can see\
    \ within 120 feet of it immediately grows into a zmey headling, or one slain zmey\
    \ headling the zmey can see within 120 feet of it regains 10 hp and becomes active\
    \ again. A severed head or zmey headling smeared in a pound of salt can't be affected\
    \ by this lair action.  \n- Spread Forest's Gloom. Light reduces in a 30-foot-radius\
    \ sphere centered on a point the zmey can see within 120 feet of it. Bright light\
    \ becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical\
