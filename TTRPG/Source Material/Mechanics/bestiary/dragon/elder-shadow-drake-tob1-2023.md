# [Elder Shadow Drake](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/elder-shadow-drake-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 143*  

*A large dragon with black scales and shadowy wings emerges from the darkness. Its red eyes glare bright as coals, and it speaks in a deep monotone.*

## Solitary Lairs

They haunt dark and lonely places, such as deep caves, dense forests, shadowy ruins, and many wild locations in the Plane of Shadow. They are long-lived for drakes, often reaching 250 years of age, and mate rarely, abandoning their eggs shortly before hatching.

## Fade Into Shadows

An elder shadow drake naturally fades from view in areas of dim light or darkness, becoming invisible until it attacks or is bathed in sunlight.
