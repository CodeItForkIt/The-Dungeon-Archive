# [Young Void Dragon](Mechanics\bestiary\dragon/young-void-dragon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 130*  

*A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon's body.*

## Children of the Stars

Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world and wander between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves.

## Witnesses to the Void

Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the Void itself. They carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage.

## Voracious Scholars

Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, Void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures.

    \ the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC\
    \ 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
    \ On a success, the creature's speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube.\
    \ A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the dragon's breath\
    \ weapon recharges.  \n- Stellar Breath. The dragon exhales star fire in a\
    \ 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) radiant damage on a failed\
