# [Alseid](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/alseid-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 15*  

*Alseids are the graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, with the slender upper body of an elf and the lower body of a deer. Because they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home, they are sometimes called "grove nymphs," despite being more closely related to elves than nymphs.*

## Forest Guardians

Alseids see the forest as an individual and a friend. They are suspicious of outsiders who do not share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid's white tail; if they chase after it as it bounds away, the sympathetic alseid may lead it toward a road or trail that can carry them out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may follow the same tail to their doom. Alseids have no compunction about slaughtering trespassers who burn or cut down their forest.

## Antlers Show Status

Alseids have antlers growing from their foreheads. These antlers grow very slowly, branching every 10 years for the first century of life. Further points develop only with the blessing of the forest. No fourteen-point imperial alseids are known to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with thirteen points. Because antlers signify status, alseids never use them in combat. Cutting an alseid's antlers entirely off or just removing points is a humiliating and grave punishment.

## White-Tailed Wanderers

Alseids have a deep connection with forest magic of all kinds, and their leaders favor the druid and ranger classes.
