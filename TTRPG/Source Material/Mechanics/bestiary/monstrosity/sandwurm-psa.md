# [Sandwurm](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/sandwurm-psa.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 35*  

Sandwurms are the largest predators of Shefet, swimming through the sandy dunes like [serpents](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/river-serpent-psa.md) through water. They are capable of amazing speed and can lift their lamprey-like heads far above the ground to snatch even flying creatures. But they can also lie in wait beneath the sands for years, until the slightest tremor alerts them to the presence of prey.

## The Desert Lands

The desolate wilderness beyond the protection of the Hekma is largely uncharted. Immediately beyond the protective veil is a chaotic dune sea called Shefet, the Scouring Sands. The desert wears away at the edges of the fertile lands surrounding Naktamun, serving as a constant reminder that only the bounty and protection of the God-Pharaoh stand between the people of the city-state and a grisly death in the sands beyond. Beyond Shefet are parched, cracked expanses called Ramunap, the Broken Lands. The ruins of ancient civilizations are said to lie in the Broken Lands, though no one has ever explored such ruins and returned to Naktamun to tell of them.
