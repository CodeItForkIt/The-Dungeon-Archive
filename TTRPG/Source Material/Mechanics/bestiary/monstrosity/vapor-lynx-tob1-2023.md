# [Vapor Lynx](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/vapor-lynx-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 383*  

*The great cat pads along noiselessly, while tendrils of smoke drift off its sleek, gray coat, leaving misty whorls in its wake. Its lips curl up into a fang-revealing smile as its body fades into fog.*

## Split the Herd

Vapor lynxes are capricious hunters. Devious, manipulative, and mischievous, they toy with their prey before killing it. They rarely enjoy a stand-up fight, instead coalescing in and out of the fog to harass victims and cut large groups into smaller, more manageable morsels.

## Dreary Marshlands

Their tactics have earned vapor lynxes a nasty reputation and the occasional bounty on their heads. Additionally, their magical nature makes them valuable to practitioners of the magical arts, and their beautiful, thick coats tempt many a furrier into hunts they may not be prepared to handle. For these reasons, vapor lynxes avoid civilization, fearing organized reprisal. Instead, they haunt marshes and swamps, where natural fog makes hunting easier. If an intelligent humanoid passes their way, they are happy for a change in diet.

## Chatty with Dinner

Although reclusive, vapor lynxes are intelligent, speaking both Common and Sylvan. They are particularly prideful and take joy in bantering with potential meals to belittle and frighten them. Survivors of vapor lynx encounters invariably mention their needling and self-aggrandizement.
