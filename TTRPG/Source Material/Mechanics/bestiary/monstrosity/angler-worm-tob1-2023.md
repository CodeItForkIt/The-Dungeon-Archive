# [Angler Worm](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/angler-worm-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 20*  

*As patient as a fisherman, the angler worm lights a beacon in the darkness and waits for its next meal.*

## Silk Snares

The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its snares while remaining safely hidden, emerging only to feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler worm eventually.

    \ or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A web of snares layered over a\
    \ flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is difficult terrain, and the snares\
    \ forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception))\

    \ or enters the web during its turn must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or be [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the sticky snares.\

  "name": "Coils"
- "desc": "The angler worm creates an orb of faint, blue light on a point it can see\
    \ within 20 feet of it. The light glows until the start of the worm's next turn.\
    \ When a creature that isn't an angler worm starts its turn within 60 feet of\
    \ the orb and can see the light, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw\
    \ or be [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) until the start of its\
    \ next turn. While [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed), the creature\
    \ must take the Dash action and move toward the light by the most direct route,\
    \ trying to get within 5 feet of the light. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks,\
    \ but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the creature\
    \ can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the\
    \ [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature enters the worm's\
    \ snares, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid being [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)."
