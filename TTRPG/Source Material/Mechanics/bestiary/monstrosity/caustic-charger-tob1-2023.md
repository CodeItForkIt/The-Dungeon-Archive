# [Caustic Charger](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/caustic-charger-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 51*  

*This massive hexapod trundles along, the dangling tentacles festooning its squat body barely clearing the ground. A bony brow ridge set over beady eyes dominates its head.*

Caustic chargers are large, squat creatures that dwell in inhospitable locations, making such lands even more dangerous.

## Unusual Feeder

A caustic charger's odd, toothless snout makes it difficult to hunt and devour prey, but the creature has adapted by secreting a paralytic acid from its tentacles. To make the best use of its stubby tentacles, it charges its prey, striking with its powerful brow ridge to knock over the victim. Then, the charger stands over and dissolves the creature with its tentacles, slurping up the liquefied remains with its snout.

## Solitary Hunters

Caustic chargers are belligerent horrors that attack anything that opposes them, including others of their own kind. Once a year, two chargers become tolerant enough of each other to produce young, resulting in a score of gray eggs with hard shells.

## Ornery Steeds

While not very smart and exceedingly violent, caustic chargers can be persuaded to partner with smaller creatures that might not provide much nourishment but can offer a bounty of prey. Dust goblins are the most common creatures that partner with caustic chargers, with varying degrees of success.
