# [Son of Fenris](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/son-of-fenris-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 335*  

*The massive wolf lumbers forward, malice gleaming in its black eyes. Two snake-like tongues slither in its jaws, and green scales peek from beneath its black fur.*

## Demonic Wolves

Demonic black eyes, two snakelike tongues, and green-black scales beneath their black fur betray the sons of Fenris's unnatural origins.

## Hibernate Until Ravenous

Sons of Fenris slumber beneath the snow for months, waking when they grow ravenous or when prey approaches. When hunting, they revel in wanton savagery and destruction, killing entire herds to delight in blood.

## Desperate Worshipers

Despite their fierce nature, all the sons of Fenris are divine offspring and wise in divine lore, attracting desperate souls who offer them worship and sacrifice in exchange for aid. The sons of Fenris enjoy this adulation, and they provide protection and wisdom to their followers. Sometimes, they gather enormous war bands and go reaving.
