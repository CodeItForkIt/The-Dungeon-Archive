# [Dune Mimic](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/dune-mimic-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 268*  

*The sand surges and shifts, a sinkhole opens, and sandy tendrils reach out.*

## Enormous Forms

Though most commonly seen as dunes, a dune mimic can take the form of a date palm grove, a riverbank, an enormous boulder, or other large shapes in the landscape.

## A King's Guardians

Dune mimics were created by a forgotten king as guardians for his desert tomb. Somewhere, dozens of them guard vast wealth.

## Spread by Spores

Although not intended to reproduce, they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating themselves. Now they are spread across the deserts. Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just once per century
