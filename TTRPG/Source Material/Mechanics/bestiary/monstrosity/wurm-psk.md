# [Wurm](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/wurm-psk.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 31*  

Wurms are enormous, legless creatures that burrow under the forests, mountains, and plains of Kaladesh, and which can exceed fifty feet in length when fully grown. A wurm devours everything in its path—flora, fauna, and inanimate objects alike—with a gaping maw containing multiple rings of sharp teeth and grinding plates. Rumor has it that at least one wurm tunnels beneath the large, lush park in Ghirapur called the Cowl, accounting for at least some of the mysterious disappearances there.

Both the colored scales of a wurm's skin and the winding patterns of its tunnels mimic the flow of aether through the sky. Some elf aether-seers believe that these tunnels reveal a deep connection between wurms and aether, and they explore wurm burrows in the hope of developing a similar connection. It is said that a wurm never doubles back along its own path, so following those paths is less dangerous than it might seem. However, the existence of a single wurm in an area suggests that others might be nearby, and wurm tunnels do cross each other—so not all these brave aether-seers return. Those who do are said to gain insights that they find difficult to express to others.

The [purple worm](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) in the "Monster Manual" works well as a representation of Kaladesh's wurms.
