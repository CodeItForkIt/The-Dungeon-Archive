# [Dogmole Juggernaut](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/dogmole-juggernaut-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 107*  

*This mole-like creature is the size of a large dog, with a thick, barrel-shaped body. A ring of tentacles sprouts above a mouth dominated by spade-like incisors, and cataracts fill its tiny eyes.*

## Domesticated by Dwarves

Mountain dwarves have domesticated many subterranean creatures, among them a breed of giant talpidae commonly called dogmoles. Energetic and obedient, dogmoles pull ore trolleys through mines, sniff out toxic gases and polluted waters, and help excavate trapped miners.

## Sense Cave-Ins

Dogmoles are renowned for their ability to detect imminent cave-ins and burrowing monsters, making them welcome companions in the depths. Outside the mines, dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds.

## Derro Juggernauts

Derro also use dogmoles, but such unfortunate creatures are brutalized from birth and hardened by scarification, drugs, and warping magic. This treatment forces the dogmole to grow into a large, furless mass of muscle, scar tissue, and barbed piercings with incisors the size of shortswords. Derro use dogmole juggernauts as mounts and improvised siege engines or, when not at war, as gladiatorial contestants.
