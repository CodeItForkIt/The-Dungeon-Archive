# [Map Mimic](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/map-mimic-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 269*  

*A treasure map flaps as if caught in a strong wind. It suddenly splits open, revealing a fanged mouth and face.*

## Mimic Spawn

Mimic adhesive is not just a powerful means of trapping prey, it also contains millions of microscopic larvae that feed on flesh. Most of the larvae are consumed by the mimic when it eats. Mimics are either unaware of this, or they're indifferent to the fact that they routinely cannibalize their own offspring. A few larvae survive by adhering to the clothing or equipment of someone who escaped from a full-grown mimic's attack. These larvae hitch a ride, their host taking them far from the dungeon, cavern, or ruin of their birth. There, they drop off and grow into wormlike mimic young called map mimics. In time, map mimics grow into typical mimics.

## Smaller than a Dinner Plate

Map mimics are too small to mimic the types of objects their parent does, but they still deceive prey by altering their forms. They can assume the shape, texture, and coloration of anything up to the size of a dinner plate.

## Paper Scrolls

Their preferred form is parchment paper. They can display the path they've followed on their hide, complete with important landmarks. In this form, they curl up and wait inside bottles, or in the clutches of a corpse in plain view, until an unsuspecting adventurer discovers them. If the mimic is hungry, it attacks and attaches to the finder's face. Otherwise, it continues its charade as a map, eventually leading the reader back to the parent mimic.
