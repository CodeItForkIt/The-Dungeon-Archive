# [Krake Spawn](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/krake-spawn-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 249*  

*This twisted, beast looks like the unholy union of squid and spider. Its shell-covered core has six small rubbery legs, peculiar antennae, and six tentacles around a squid's enormous beak.*

## Demonic Crossbreeds

Some believe krake spawn are demonic crossbreeds created by the aboleth, fusing kraken blood with demonic souls. Others say that krake spawn are the horrible creation of a long-forgotten meddling god, summoned to the mortal world by deep ones. Certainly, krake spawn respond to summoning magic, and spellcasters summon krake spawn through blood sacrifices to work evil in the world. However, they do so at considerable peril: unlike demons and devils, krake spawn are seldom bound by pacts of any kind.

## Outwit Humans

Though enormous and carrying an armored green shell on their six spindly legs, krake spawn are surprisingly quick and agile. Worse, they have a malicious and bloodthirsty intellect. A krake spawn is considerably smarter than most humans, who often mistake them for dumb beasts—an error that can often prove fatal.

## Iceberg Fortresses

Krake spawn live in remote, icy regions, where they fashion elaborate iceberg fortresses. These fortresses are stocked with frozen creatures (an emergency food supply), the krake spawn's treasure and library, slaves or prisoners of many races, and a hellish nest filled with the krake spawn's offspring.
