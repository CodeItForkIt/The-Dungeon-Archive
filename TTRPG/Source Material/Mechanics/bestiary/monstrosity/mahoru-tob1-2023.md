# [Mahoru](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/mahoru-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 260*  

*A white fin cut the surface of the water as the serpentine creature approached. Its wolfish head burst from the surface, revealing a body covered in fine, white fur.*

## Valuable Teeth and Fur

A mahoru's heavy jaws are filled with triangular, serrated teeth adept at tearing flesh and sundering bone. Their white fur is prized for its warmth and waterproof qualities. Their pectoral fins feature stubby, claw-tipped paws. Mahoru is a totem beast for many northern tribes. Some make arrowheads and tooth-studded clubs with the beast's fangs.

## Iceberg Hunters

Mahoru prowl northern coasts and estuaries, hunting among the fragmenting pack ice each summer. They lurk beneath the surface, catching swimmers or lurching up onto the ice to break or tilt it and send prey tumbling into the water. When necessary, they stalk beaches and riverbanks in search of carrion or unwary victims.

## Work in Pairs and Packs

Mahoru work together in mated pairs to corral everything from fish and seals to larger prey like kayaking humanoids and even polar bears. They gnaw at ice bridges and the frozen surface of lakes and rivers to create fragile patches that plunge unwary victims into waiting jaws.
