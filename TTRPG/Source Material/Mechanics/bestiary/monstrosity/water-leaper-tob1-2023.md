# [Water Leaper](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/water-leaper-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 394*  

*The frogheaded, legless creature with wide, batlike wings opens its gaping maw and shrieks. Its long, sinuous tail whips around it, tipped in a barb dripping with poison.*

## Gliding Wings

The creature has no legs or arms, but it sports a pair of wide, membranous wings. It uses its wings to glide beneath the water and to soar through the air.

## Scourge of Waterways

Water leapers plague fresh lakes and rivers. They prey on animals that come to the water's edge to drink, as well as on fishermen that ply their trade in the water leaper's territory. Stories circulate among fishers of waterways known for broken lines and missing bait. Fishers give these areas a wide berth for fear of water leapers. Desperate or unwary fishers who ignore the warnings are never seen again; drifting, empty boats are the signs of their passing.
