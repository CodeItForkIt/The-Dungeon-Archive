# [Isonade](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/isonade-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 240*  

*The creature's mighty tail thrashes ships, docks, and sailors in its path of destruction.*

## Coastal Destroyer

The isonade is a beast of destruction, sweeping away entire islands and villages. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves by forcing plentiful fish to the surface, easy pickings for even the most amateur fishers.

## Ocean Sacrifices

When coastal villagers suffer from a hurricane or tsunami, they fall back on folklore and blame the stirrings of the isonade. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.

## Ancient Being

The beast's age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell various legends of the creature. Some say it is the last of its kind, while others say that a small group of isonades lurks in the depths.

    \ a creature takes 49 (14d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a success, a creature takes half the damage and is pushed up to 10 feet out\
    \ of the isonade's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If\
