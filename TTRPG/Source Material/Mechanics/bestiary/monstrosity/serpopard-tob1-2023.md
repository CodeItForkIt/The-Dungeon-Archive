# [Serpopard](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/serpopard-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 322*  

*The spotted and scaly quadruped runs on hairless leonine paws, while its draconic head perches atop a sinuous, serpentine neck.*

## Swaying, Snakelike Cats

Serpopards are 13 feet long and weigh 600 pounds, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable talons. A serpopard's neck is in constant motion, swaying like a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in unexpected directions.

## Easily Distracted

Serpopards are foul-tempered predators and scavengers, and they are known to occasionally cannibalize their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their killsâ€”or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.

## Musk Glands

In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images of these odd animals appear regularly in ancient tomb iconography and temple decoration.
