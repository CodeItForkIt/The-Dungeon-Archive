# [Leshy](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/leshy-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 251*  

*This strange man is covered in bark and root-like growths and wears loose scraps of clothing. The hair and beard that frame his piercing green eyes writhe like living vines.*

## Expanding the Wild

Solitary leshy tend plants and animals in groves around great forests, and they are the self-proclaimed protectors of the forest outskirts. Leshy have little patience for interlopers and often kill, abduct, or frighten off trailblazers and guides. They sabotage cultivated land, wipe out trails, and cultivate weed walls and thickets to keep civilization at bay. They transplant dangerous plant creatures to discourage new settlements, and some wrangle rabid animals to the same purpose.

## Ax Thieves

Leshy prefer trickery to combat, leading intruders astray by mimicking animal and humanoid sounds. If challenged, they do everything in their power to scare intruders away, but they never hesitate to fight to the death in service to the forest if necessary. Leshy hate metal, especially axes, and they go out of their way to steal metal items and lead those who use them astray.

## Accept Bribes

With careful courting and appropriate gifts, it is possible to gain a leshy's capricious assistance. This can be risky, because leshy love mischief. Still, a leshy's help is sometimes essential to a group traversing ancient woodlands.
