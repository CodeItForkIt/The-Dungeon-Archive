# [Bastet Temple Cat](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/bastet-temple-cat-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 32*  

*A slim feline far larger than any house cat slips from the shadows. Its coat glistens like ink as it chirps, and its tail flicks teasingly as its golden eyes observe the doings in its temple.*

## Bred for Magic

Temple cats of Bastet are thought by some to be celestials, but they are a terrestrial breed, created by the priesthood through generations of enchantment.

## Lazy Temple Pets

By day, temple cats laze about their shrines and porticos, searching out attention from the faithful and occasionally granting boons when it suits then.

## Fierce Shrine Guardians

By night, they serve as guardians in their temples, inciting would-be thieves to come close before viciously mauling them. More than one would-be rogue has met his or her fate at the claws and teeth of these slim, black-furred beasts. Bastet temple cats are fierce enemies of temple dogs.

    \ whenever it takes damage from a source other than the cat, the target can repeat\
    \ the saving throw. A [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target\
    \ can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
