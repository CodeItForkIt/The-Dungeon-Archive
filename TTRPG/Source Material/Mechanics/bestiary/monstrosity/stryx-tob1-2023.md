# [Stryx](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/stryx-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 350*  

*The brown owl in the tree suddenly opens its beak. Instead of a hoot, it reveals very human teeth and speaks.*

Stryxes are the result of the Moonlit King's mad experiments deep within the Plane of Shadows. They resemble owls and can pass as normal birds as long as they don't speak or open their mouths. The stryx have a larger mouth hidden behind their beaks, filled with gleaming human teeth. Stryxes range in color from pale gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes.

## Strange Alchemy

Stryxes are unnatural beings that came about through terrible manipulation of normal owls and kidnapped humans. The Moonlit King of the shadow fey, banished and imprisoned in his tower, is desperate to touch the outside world. His crazed experiments blended shreds of mortal souls into shadowy owls and thus brought the stryx into being.

## The Shadow's Eyes

The truth of the stryx is all but unknown outside the Moonlit King's inner circle, where these creatures serve as the king's eyes and ears. Stryxes thrive in the Plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied, however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their mad creator.

> [!note] Stryx Familiars
> 
> Stryxes make excellent spies, and they delight in serving others. The strange owls often become outstanding spies and translators by bonding themselves to a master. Some spellcasters seek out the stryx and strike a bargain to gain the creature's service as a familiar. While most stryxes make a show of hard bargaining, secretly they are eager to strike the deal. Stryxes that serve spellcasters have the following trait.
> 
> **Familiar.** The stryx can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the stryx senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the stryx is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the stryx's Keen Hearing and Sight trait. At any time and for any reason, the stryx can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
