# [Annelidast](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/annelidast-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 21*  

*The massive worm erupted from the earth, crushing all near it and scooping up the remains.*

An annelidast is a gigantic worm that slumbers for decades at a time in the bowels of the earth, where the rock itself radiates primordial magic. Over millennia, they have grown lead-plated carapaces to shield themselves from the magic.

## Unique Predation

Each century, an annelidast wakes and travels to the surface to feed. The worm eats through baleen-like teeth that help it filter feed through the earth as it travels underground, but this method of eating requires it to pulverize larger surface prey before consumption.

## Sleeping Plague

The annelidast's exterior is saturated with the primordial magic of its deep-earth home. When an annelidast nears waking, it burrows toward the surface in a dreamlike state, following vibrations in the earth made by living creatures. As it lies just beneath the surface rousing from its slumber, the primordial magic infusing it radiates outward and sickens creatures living there, making them easier prey when it fully wakes.
