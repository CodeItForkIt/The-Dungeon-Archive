# [Nightgarm](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/nightgarm-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 285*  

*This red-furred lupine creature has a too-wide mouth and blood-soaked claws.*

Created in a ritual performed over a pregnant worg, nightgarms are always born female and are followers of the Great Wolf.

## Wide-Jawed Lupines

Nightgarms resemble red-furred worgs with wide mouths, half-formed fingers, and comfort with bipedal and quadrupedal movement. They can hold items in their front paws, and their jaws can open to swallow especially large creatures.

## Mother of Falsehearts

If a nightgarm eats a humanoid corpse whole, it gives birth nine hours later to a duplicate of the victim, known as a falseheart (see the Falseheart Template sidebar). Falsehearts are loyal to the nightgarm that birthed them and retain enough of the victim's memories and capabilities to integrate into society as the victim.

> [!note] Falseheart Template
> 
> The corpse of any Humanoid can become a falseheart if eaten whole by a nightgarm. When a Humanoid becomes a falseheart, it retains its statistics, except as described below.
> 
> **Type.** The Humanoid's type changes to Monstrosity
> 
> **Alignment.** The falseheart's alignment changes to chaotic evil.
> 
> **New Trait Convincing Copy.** A creature very familiar with the Humanoid the falseheart replaced can tell the falseheart is an imitation with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.
> 
> **New Trait Keen Smell.** The falseheart has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.
> 
> **New Trait Mother's Love.** The falseheart is magically bound to the nightgarm that birthed it, following the nightgarm's telepathic commands.
