# [Owl Harpy](Mechanics\bestiary\monstrosity/owl-harpy-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 230*  

*This winged woman's face is wreathed in a headdress of feathers; her luminous eyes and aquiline nose lend beauty to her feral demeanor. Her sharp, taloned feet seem even more inhuman by comparison.*

## Harpy Queens

An owl harpy is a queen among her kind, possessing superior grace and intelligence and an owl's predatory instinct and savage appetite. Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp. They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in deserts and jungles.

## Nocturnal Magic

Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunderous noises distress them.

## Servants of Darkness

Owl harpies are natural bards thanks to their sharp wits, and most are zealous followers of deities and demon lords of darkness and night. Less common but not unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures.
