# [Shadow Fey Forest Hunter](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/shadow-fey-forest-hunter-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 161*  

*The shadows flicker slightly, the only warning before a hail of arrows erupts from the concealed elf hidden in the gloom.*

Dressed in exquisitely wrought mail and leather jerkins, forest hunters are even more lithe and graceful than most shadow fey.

## Shadow Stalkers

Forest hunters roam the deep woods connected to the Plane of Shadow, as well as the forests' dark reflections within the Plane of Shadow. They are skilled trackers and stalkers, hunting animals and more dangerous game. Many forest hunters serve in the Wild Hunt. A hunter that has at one time ridden at the Lord of the Hunt 's side is afforded great respect, even fear, because of the common belief that such a hunter can implore the Lord of the Hunt to notice an enemy.
