# [Nkosi](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/nkosi-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 286*  

*With a thick mane of beaded locks, this leonine humanoid grins with a mouthful of pointed teeth.*

## Beads and Braids

The nkosi resemble bestial humans with cat's eyes, slender tails, and the fangs and fur of a lion. Most grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi's true form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape, taking the form of a lion.

## Pridelords

Nkosi pridelords are exceptionally tall and muscular leaders. They keep impressive manes, but they are known for their roar, which wakes the feral heart inside all nkosi.
