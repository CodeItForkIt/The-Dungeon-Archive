# [Mage of Usamigaras](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/mage-of-usamigaras-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 206*  

The common members of the Mages of Usamigaras use their magical talents to charm and deceive the faction's opponents.

## Mages of Usamigaras

The Mages of Usamigaras are Cynidicean spellcasters who worship Usamigaras, a god of magic, messengers, and lies. They hide their identities and intentions behind silver masks depicting the face of their god. Secrecy is key among the Mages of Usamigaras. Members whisper in the presence of outsiders and pepper their speech with lies, even obvious ones. Such behavior isn't rude among members, who view deceit as worthy of celebration, not chastisement.
