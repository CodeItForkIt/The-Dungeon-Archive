# [Corvum Diviner](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/corvum-diviner-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 194*  

Diviners specialize in esoteric spells and rituals, which can be used to see the threads of fate that move the world. Even when such predictions fail, they usually reveal useful information in the process. Corvums prize knowledge in all its forms, often dealing in secrets the way others deal in goods, and so many are drawn to practice the diviner's art.
