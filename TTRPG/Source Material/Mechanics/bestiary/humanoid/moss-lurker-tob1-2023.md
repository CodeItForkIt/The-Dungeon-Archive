# [Moss Lurker](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/moss-lurker-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 278*  

*Somewhat like the cruel crossbreed of troll and gnome, this creature has a long, greenish beard and hair. Its hide is peaty amber, and a vaguely fungal scent surrounds it.*

Like their trollish relatives, moss lurkers have large, often grotesque noses. Their claws are bright red when unsheathed, and their teeth tend toward the long and snaggly. They wear simple clothes of homespun wool or leather, or go naked in the summer. Their hats are sometimes festooned with toadstools or ferns as primitive camouflage.

## Large Rocks and Poisoned Gifts

Moss lurkers have a fondness for throwing large stones at enemies. Some stones even seem too large for the lurker to heft. They also enjoy poisoning food and drink then offering it to creatures lost in the forest.
