# [City Watch Captain](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/city-watch-captain-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 407*  

With its talents, the city watch captain could easily have been on the other side of the law, but the captain likes the respect the position commands within the city, especially when leading a patrol of guards. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw its blade to end a threat to its city. The captain maintains a no-nonsense stance when on duty and adheres to the laws of whichever city it protects. Some city watch captains let their power and authority go to their heads, while others wear the office like a badge of pride, laying down their lives in defense of the city and its citizens.
