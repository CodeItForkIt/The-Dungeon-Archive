*This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees, gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two intelligent, bulbous eyes.*

## Jungle Rulers

These small, squirrel-like humanoids live in reclusive societies deep in the jungle. They are omnivorous gliders, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They sometimes barter with other humanoids for metal and forged items, but they prefer to rely on the forest for most of their needs.

## Greyfur Elders

Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered lemurfolk, as much as 80 years old. Their age can be estimated by the graying of their fur, but they don't track the years. Greyfurs are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though they rarely pursue the art of necromancyâ€”a strong taboo prohibits them from interacting with the dead. A typical lemurfolk stands 2 feet tall and weighs 30 pounds.
