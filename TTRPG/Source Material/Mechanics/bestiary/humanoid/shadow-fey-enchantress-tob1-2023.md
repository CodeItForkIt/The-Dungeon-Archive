# [Shadow Fey Enchantress](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/shadow-fey-enchantress-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 160*  

*This ravishing shadow fey woman moves with alluring grace. Her voice rings like a bell, and in her hearing, worldly cares and sorrows melt away.*

Beyond even great physical beauty, the sheer presence of a shadow fey enchantress can lay the most stalwart foes low. Almost universally female, Enchantresses are beautiful beyond compare.

## Enchanting Shadows

Enchantresses are also powerful spellcasters who infuse their words and manner with the beguiling power of shadow to turn enemies against one another with a few words and a deadly smile. They augment the force of their minds with fey-wrought blades, infusing their weapons with power that shreds their victims' psyche as well as their flesh.
