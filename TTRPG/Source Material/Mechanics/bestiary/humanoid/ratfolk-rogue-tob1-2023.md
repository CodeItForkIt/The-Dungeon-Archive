# [Ratfolk Rogue](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/ratfolk-rogue-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 302*  

*The halfling-sized, furred creature has a twitching snout, bony feet, and a long, pink tail.*

The ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues, and tricksters. Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societiesâ€”though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.

## Adaptable

Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.

## Fast Fighters

Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring down a foe. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a "Rat King" who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon, or an intelligent undead.
