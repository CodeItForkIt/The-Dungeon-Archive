# [Mercenary Envoy](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/mercenary-envoy-aitfr-fcd.md)
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: From Cyan Depths p. 10*  

These mercenaries stand for the Banner of Blades and the Iron Lions at Tyreus's fortress, but they might not be representative of those armies. These are rank-and-file warriors capable of demonstrating coordinated attacks and formations. They are neither the most capable lieutenants nor the rough-andtumble masses of these small armies.

For the purposes of their Inspired Courage feature, the mercenaries of both companies consider each other allies while at the fortressâ€”unless the adventurers do something to drive them apart.
