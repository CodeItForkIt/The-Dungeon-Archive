# [Kobold Alchemist](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/kobold-alchemist-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 244*  

*This slight, reptilian humanoid is bedecked with ceramic flasks and glass vials. An acrid reek follows in its wake.*

Kobold alchemists are usually smelled before they are seen, thanks to the apothecary's store of chemicals and poisons they carry. Alchemists often sport mottled and discolored scales and skin, caused by the caustic nature of their obsessions. They raid alchemy shops and magical laboratories to gather more material to fuel their alchemical experiments.

## Dangerous Assets

Alchemists can be a great boon to their clan, but at a cost. Not only do the alchemists require rare, expensive, and often dangerous substances to ply their trade, they tend to be a little unhinged. Their experiments yield powerful weapons and defensive concoctions that can save many kobold lives, but the destruction caused by an experiment gone awry can be devastating for the alchemist's neighbors.
