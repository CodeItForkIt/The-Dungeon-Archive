## Salvage

Someone who has proficiency with Medicine can attempt a DC 13 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check to extract the largest tumor from a morbus kobold elder. If this check succeeds, someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies or an herbalism kit can wrap the tumor with herbs and reagents worth 200 gp. The wrapped tumor must be left in open air so it receives daily sunlight for 7 days. Someone must cast lesser restoration on the tumor during this time. At the end of the process, the tumor can be polished and set in a necklace, making a periapt of health.

## Lore

- **DC 13 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Morbus kobolds are a known for spreading disease. Despite their role in propagating contagions, they are immune to the effects of all known diseases.  
- **DC 13 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)).** The first documented record of an encounter with a morbus kobold was in the city of Liesech during the early days of the Weeping Pox. Shortly after this encounter, the Weeping Pox began spreading in nearby regions.  
- **DC 16 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)).** The largest tumors in morbus kobold elders can be treated then dried in sunlight to create a ward against diseases.
