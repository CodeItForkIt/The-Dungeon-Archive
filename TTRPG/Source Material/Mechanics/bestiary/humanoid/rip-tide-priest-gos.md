# [Rip Tide Priest](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/rip-tide-priest-gos.md)
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 248*  

Priests of the Rip Tide cult gather in secret cabals to perform dark rituals that glorify Olhydra, the elemental Princess of Evil Water, as the embodiment of water's destructiveness. They believe that using water to kill their enemies, such as through ritual drowning, earns them Olhydra's favor.
