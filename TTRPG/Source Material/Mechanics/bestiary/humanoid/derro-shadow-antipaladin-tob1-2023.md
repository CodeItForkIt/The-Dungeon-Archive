# [Derro Shadow Antipaladin](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/derro-shadow-antipaladin-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 89*  

*This blue-skinned creature resembles a stunted dwarf. Its colorless eyes are large, and its white hair is wild. The expression on its face is a terrible rictus of madness and hate*.

All derro are mad, but some devote their very souls to the service of insanity. They embrace the powers of darkness and channel shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.

## Herald of Madness

The shadow antipaladin is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins, these unhinged creatures aren't swaggering warriors encased in steel or their dark reflections. A shadow antipaladin instead serves as a more subtle vector for the madness of its patron. They are masters of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith of those who believe that goodness can survive the approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin's wake.
