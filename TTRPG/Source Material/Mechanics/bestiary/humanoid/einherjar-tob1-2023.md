# [Einherjar](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/einherjar-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 156*  

*A line of stout, bearded warriors with golden auras stand ready, adorned in chain mail and carrying battle axes and oaken shields. Their badges and symbols are all different, and no two have the same braided pattern in their beards.*

The einherjar are great warriors chosen by the valkyries. They eat and drink their fill of boar and mead each night, then spend their days preparing for Ragnarok. Some of this is combat training, and other portions are raids against the giants fighting the gods. Regardless of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning in Odin's hall, leaving them without fear of death.

## Defenders of the Mortal World

Occasionally, ravenfolk guide a troop of einherjar against some of Loki's minions on the Material Plane. These raids are often small battles that further delay the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many evil spawn. They fight against giants, demons, [Tooltip Not Found], and other evil creatures, but the einherjar themselves are not exactly saintly. They can drink and carouse with the loudest and most boastful of humanoids. Though otherworldly and servants of Odin, einherjar are very humanlike, if somewhat larger than life.

## Fear Dragons

The einherjar are superstitiously fearful of dragons and dragonkin, the distant progeny of the world serpent.

## Never Speak to the Living

In theory, the einherjar are forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their words through a valkyrie, ratatosk, ravenfolk, or one of the other races allied with Odin. In practice, this rule is often flouted, though if Loki's servants notice it, they can dismiss any einherjar back to Valhalla for a day.
