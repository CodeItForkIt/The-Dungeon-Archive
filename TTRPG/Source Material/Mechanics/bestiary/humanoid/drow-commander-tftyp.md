## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** The drow carries three magical bolts, as follows:

- A *bolt of holding*, which casts [hold person](Mechanics/spells/hold-person.md) on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target  
- A *bolt of blinding*, which casts [blindness/deafness](Mechanics/spells/blindness-deafness.md) to blind on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target  
- A *bolt of vapors*, which casts [stinking cloud](Mechanics/spells/stinking-cloud.md) centered on the point it hits  

Each of these effects has a spell save DC of 15 and a duration of 1 minute.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](Mechanics/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](Mechanics/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](Mechanics/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](Mechanics/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword +2.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d6 + 6`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow +1.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) while [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
