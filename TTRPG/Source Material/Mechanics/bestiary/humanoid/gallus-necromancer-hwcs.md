# [Gallus Necromancer](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/gallus-necromancer-hwcs.md)
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Gallus aren't typically drawn down the path of necromancy, but a few mavericks with arcane talent and the inclination to study the darker side of magic have found success in The Avium. More commonly, such necromancers study the art theoretically, learning how it disrupts the balance of life and death so that their students can be taught how to effectively counter such vile spells.
