# [Black Knight Commander](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/black-knight-commander-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 406*  

The black knight commander strikes an imposing figure upon its chosen mount; one that inspires bloodlust in its allies and fear in its foes. Devoted to its own twisted code, the black knight commander has a sense of honor but spares no compassion for those who stand in its way. Whether the knight fights for a dark lord or a demonic god, all its foes will be trampled into the dust and their families slaughtered so there can be no revenge. The only victory is a total victory.

  "name": "Mounted Charge"
- "desc": "The black knight commander is rarely seen without its warhorse mount. The\
    \ warhorse wears custom barding that raises is Armor Class to 15, and mounting\
    \ and dismounting the warhorse costs the commander only 5 feet of movement. While\

    \ It then moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space\
    \ of any Large or smaller creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity\
    \ attacks. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, that\
    \ creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature\
    \ takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and is [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened).\
    \ A [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) creature can make a\
    \ DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect\
    \ on itself on a success."
