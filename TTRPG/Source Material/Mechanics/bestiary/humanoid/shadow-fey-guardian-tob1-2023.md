# [Shadow Fey Guardian](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/shadow-fey-guardian-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 162*  

*A hulking brute, this elvish figure towers over his fellows and wields massive weapons. Patches of his body are swallowed by inky blackness that writhes and crawls, and his eyes are hollow black pits.*

Shadow fey guardians are massive creatures trained and bred for battle. They appear as massive versions of shadow fey, but the stuff of shadow corrupts them even more than their brethren, expanding their size and power to an ogreish strength. Patches of shadow swallow parts of their body and crawl about, revealing and obscuring more by inches at a time. They stand nearly 10 feet tall and weigh over 700 pounds.

## Loyal Protectors

Guardians are fanatically loyal to their superiors. Employed as house guards or even personal bodyguards for important shadow fey, guardians are unshakable in their duty. The shadow reaches into their minds and souls, so that not even powerful magic can bend their hearts or break their resolve. Guardians are independent thinkers, but they discharge their duty with single-minded dedication.
