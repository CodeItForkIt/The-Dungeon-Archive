*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 33*  

*Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. It's a solid slab of muscle that towers over most humans.*

The hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their muscular bodies. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.

## Sworn to the Bear King

Bearfolk are almost universally the subjects of the Bear King. The bearfolk protect the cities of their northern kingdom and roam the wooded roads of the wilderness. The greatest number of bearfolk are concentrated around the court of the Bear King himself, with ancient bear jarls governing their unruly kin. Only a handful of renegades, exiles, and other rogue bearfolk live permanently outside this society.

## Passionate and Volatile

Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.
