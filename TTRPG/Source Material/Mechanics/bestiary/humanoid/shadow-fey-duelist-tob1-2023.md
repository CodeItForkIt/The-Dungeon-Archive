# [Shadow Fey Duelist](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/shadow-fey-duelist-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 159*  

*The pale-skinned elf wears a gleaming breastplate and tight-fitting clothing. He moves like the wind, evading blows with effortless skill. When he stops and smiles, his blade is slick with crimson*.

Shadow fey duelists are elite warriors, often of noble lineage. Swift and sure beyond compare, duelists are often taller and more wiry than others of their kind. Their armor, clothing, and weapons are of exquisite make, fashioned from only the finest materials, as befits their station.

## Deadly Nobles

A nobleman or woman of the shadow fey is not to be taken lightly—many courtiers or politicians are deadly with their slim blades, and they are known to distill virulent poisons. Often a skilled duelist serves as a champion for her liege, standing in the noble's stead in challenges or serving as an elite bodyguard.
