# [Bandit Lord](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/bandit-lord-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 406*  

Not just the leader of a simple gang, the bandit lord has gathered a small army of outlaws and brigands together through force of personality, wit, and strength of arms. To keep those followers in line, the bandit leader must rely on loyal captains whom the bandit lord rewards for their successes and brutally punishes for their failures.

## Ambitious Leaders

Unlike those captains, who crave coin and maybe fame, the bandit lord is building an empire. The bandit lord is always on the lookout for ways to expand at the expense of various rivals and plans contingencies for every occasion, realizing that nothing lasts forever. The bandit lord is ruthless when that's beneficial and magnanimous when it costs nothing.
