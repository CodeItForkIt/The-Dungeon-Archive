# [Kobold Trapsmith](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/kobold-trapsmith-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 246*  

*This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers. All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs, and twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles*.

Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts. These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world, and those that don't meet an early demise through accident or violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.

## Improvisers

Trapsmiths are adept at improvising on-the-fly. They can use whatever spare parts are at hand to create simple thieves' tools or construct makeshift traps to fling at foes.

## Shifting Peril

Trapsmiths aren't warriors and avoid direct confrontation with enemies that aren't mired in traps or engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape. A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders, along tunnels and paths they've already cleared and believe to be safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.
