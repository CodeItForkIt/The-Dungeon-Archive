# [Folk of Leng](Mechanics\bestiary\humanoid/folk-of-leng-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 190*  

*This person has goatlike legs, small horns partially hidden beneath a hood, and a mouth full of rows of serrated teeth. Its clothes are a mixture of heavy leathers and bright silks.*

## Dimensional Merchants

The folk of Leng are interplanar merchants and avid slavers, trading silks, rubies, and the magicinfused stones of Leng for humanoid slaves. They sail between worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They are said to befriend Void dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the Void.

## A High Plateau

Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded by hills and peaks. Its cities are places which some claim have fallen into ruin, and which others claim to have visited in living memory.

## Love of Nets

When in combat, the folk of Leng use nets woven from silk taken from their enemies, the spiders of Leng.
