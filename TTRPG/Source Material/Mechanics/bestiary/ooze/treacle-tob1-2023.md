*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 368*  

*The trapped rabbit squeals as it pulls against the rope binding it. Suddenly, the rabbit's form shifts, revealing it to be a pale, pearlescent ooze ready to pounce on prey.*

A curious bunny, an abandoned toy, or a delicate songbird can spell slow death for the unprepared. Beneath any of these facades may lurk a treacle waiting to feed on a gullible victim, mewling and cooing all the while. Whether by natural selection or arcane tampering, these compact oozes prey on kindness.

## Diet of Blood

Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat. The treacles' soft bodies absorb psychic impressions and take the shape of unthreatening creatures. In the wild, treacles assume the form of an animal's offspring to lie close and feed.

## Pet Polymorph

Among humanoids, treacles transform into pets, toys, or injured animals. Treacles don't choose their forms consciously, instead relying on a primitive form of telepathy to sense which shapes a potential victim finds least threatening or most enticing. They can hold a new shape for several hours, even if the intended victim is no longer present.

## Slow Drain

Once they have assumed a nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they're in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps. If threatened or injured, treacles flee. A sated treacle detaches from its victim and seeks a cool, dark place to rest and digest.
