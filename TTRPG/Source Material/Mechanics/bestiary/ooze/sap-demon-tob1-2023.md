# [Sap Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\ooze/sap-demon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 315*  

*The axe mark in the tree oozes with viscous sap that forms into a small, vaguely humanoid shape at the tree's roots. It half walks and half flows forward.*

## Tree Oozes

Despite the name, sap demons aren't true demons. They are sentient oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or injured. A few hours after the injury, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree's attacker; if the tree cutter had a beard, the sap demon's human-like head drips in the vague shape of a beard. After dispatching the tree's attacker, most sap demons return to the tree, though some remain curious or malevolent enough to continue exploring the world.

## Reckless Possessors

A sap demon earns its name from its ability to possess another creature by oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon makes the host bleed as the tree bled and is reckless with the body. However, no matter how the body is bandaged or cured, the host perpetually bleeds.

    \ except ones that restore a creature's hp maximum. The ooze retains its Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, and Charisma and condition immunities. It otherwise uses the possessed\
    \ target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class\
    \ features, or proficiencies.\n\nWhile possessed, the target's body seeps blood\
    \ out of its ears, nose, and eyes, and the target takes 2 (1d4) acid damage\
    \ at the end of each hour. Its hp maximum is also reduced by that amount. This\
    \ reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the possession ends.\
    \ The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hp, the ooze ends it as a bonus\
    \ action, or the ooze is forced out by an effect like the [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, the ooze reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this sap demon's Soul Sap for 24\
    \ hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
