# [Oozasis](Mechanics\bestiary\ooze/oozasis-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 290*  

*The oasis appears as an idyllic desert respite, offering water, shade, and even edible fruit and nuts in the trees above.*

## Mockmire

The oozasis, or oasis ooze, is also known as a mockmire in other climates. It mimics a peaceful, pristine watering hole to draw in unsuspecting prey. An oozasis cycles seemingly at random between activity and dormancy.

## Quest Givers

Within its odd physiology stirs an ancient mind with an inscrutable purpose. Far from being a mindless sludge, its fractured intelligence occasionally reads the thoughts of visitors. At these times, it tries to coerce them into undertaking quests for cryptic reasons.

## Ancient Minds

Some tales claim these creatures preserve the memories of mad wizards from dead empires, or that they have unimaginably ancient, inhuman origins.

    \ throw or be affected by the [geas](Mechanics/spells/geas.md) spell for 30 days.\
    \ While under the geas, the affected creature must perform a specific, seemingly\
    \ minor task that furthers the decades-long goals of the oozasis. Such a task\
    \ could be planting a white rose in a specific garden, rescuing the next endangered\

  "name": "Pseudopod"
- "desc": "The oozasis emits mind-altering vapors. Each creature within 20 feet of\
    \ the oozasis must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature\
    \ takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers either tranquility or turmoil for\
    \ minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't suffer tranquility\
    \ or turmoil. A creature suffering tranquility is [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ and can't attack. A creature suffering turmoil is unable to distinguish friend\
    \ from foe and must move to and attack the nearest creature other than the oozasis\
    \ on each of its turns, stalking off in a random direction if no creature is in\
    \ range. A creature suffering tranquility or turmoil can repeat the saving throw\
    \ at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
