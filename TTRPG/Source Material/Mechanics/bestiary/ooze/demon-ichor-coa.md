- "desc": "A creature that touches the ichor or hits it with a melee attack while\
    \ within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made\
    \ of metal or wood that hits the ichor corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon\
    \ takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty\
    \ drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or\
    \ wood that hits the ichor is destroyed after dealing damage. The ichor can eat\
    \ through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round."

    \ −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces\
    \ its AC to 10."

    \ ichors are one size smaller than the original ichor."
