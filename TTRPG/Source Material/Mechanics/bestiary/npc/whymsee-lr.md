- "desc": "Whymsee's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit\
    \ with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no\

- "desc": "While underwater, Whymsee can expel an ink cloud in a 20-foot radius. The\
    \ cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures\
    \ other than kraken priests or a kraken. Each creature other than a kraken priest\
    \ or a kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving\
    \ throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage\
    \ on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears\
    \ at the end of Whymsee's next turn."

    \ to AC and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in\
    \ her shell, Whymsee is [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), her speed\
    \ is 0 and can't increase, she has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, it\
    \ can't take reactions, and the only action she can take is a bonus action to\
    \ emerge."
