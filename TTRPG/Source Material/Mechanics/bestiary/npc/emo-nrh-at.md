- "desc": "Emo's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md)\
    \ spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, Emo decides which\
    \ way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against Emo's\

- "desc": "Emo shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates),\
    \ choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:\n\n- 1. Happiness\
    \ Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or\
    \ fall [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) with laughter, becoming [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ and unable to stand up for 1 minute or until Emo harms the creature. The target\
    \ can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect\
    \ on itself on a success.  \n- 2. Sadness Ray. The targeted creature must\
    \ succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is\
    \ overcome by sorrow and takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction\
    \ until the end of its next turn. On its next turn, it can use either an action\
    \ or a bonus action, not both. On a successful save, the target takes half as\
    \ much damage and suffers none of the other effects.  \n- 3. Anger Ray. The\
    \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled\
    \ to duel with Emo for 1 minute. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against\
    \ creatures other than Emo and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts\
    \ to move more than 30 feet away from Emo.  \n- 4. Anxiety Ray. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or lose the ability\
    \ to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can see as enemies\
    \ for 1 minute. Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,\
    \ ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n\n    Whenever the affected creature\
    \ targets another creature with an attack, spell, or other ability, it must choose\
    \ the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the\
    \ attack, spell, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity\
    \ attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it\
    \ is able to.  \n- 5. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC\
    \ 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute.  \n\n    The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of\
    \ each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  \n- 6. Desolation\
    \ Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw.\
    \ On a successful save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage, and the spell\
    \ ends. On a failed save, the target takes 5d10 psychic damage and perceives\
    \ itself to be confined within an illusory stone cell for 1 minute. The target\
    \ can't see or hear anything beyond the cell and is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
    \  \n- 7. Jealousy Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom\
    \ saving throw or become [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) for\
    \ 1 minute. While the target is [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way, it must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make\
    \ a melee attack against a creature that Emo chooses. The target can repeat the\
    \ saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on\
    \ a success.  \n- 8. Disgusting Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on\
    \ a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the target\
    \ is enveloped in sphere of yellow, nauseating gas and spends its action on its\
    \ next turn retching and reeling.  \n- 9. Surprise Ray. The targeted creature\
    \ must succeed on a  \n\n    DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded)\
    \ by a spray of color until the end of its next turn.  \n- 10. Trust Ray.\
    \ The targeted creature must succeed on a  \n\n    DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or\
    \ be [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Emo for 1 hour or until\
    \ Emo harms the creature.  "
