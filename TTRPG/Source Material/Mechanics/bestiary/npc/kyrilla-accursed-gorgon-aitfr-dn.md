# [Kyrilla, Accursed Gorgon](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/kyrilla-accursed-gorgon-aitfr-dn.md)
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night p. 12*  

Some small part of Kyrilla hopes she might be pardoned from her immortal curse one day, but her ire and spite have overtaken her heart, and the only way she can imagine escaping eternity is by impressing the gods with her tenacity. She doesn't want pity nor compassion. She wants to be feared and loathed and to press on with existence despite it all. And now that Kathikon is dead and she is alone, she cannot remember mercy.

## Personality Trait

"I am quick to judge others and find them wanting."

## Ideal

"Spite. I survive despite a curse from the godsâ€”I'm not about to go out into the world where fools will try to kill me."

## Bond

"Kathikon was the love of my life. No one else matters to me."

## Flaw

"I never admit when I am wrong."

## Horrific Appearance

Once, Kyrilla looked much like other gorgons of her world. Now, with her curse upon her, Kyrilla's healthy greenish skin has grown sickly pale, and the segmented cables she wore like hair have gone from shiny black to matte gray and green. Her legs became a long, segmented tail. Her eyes now glow green, bright enough to create dim light in front of her. She has grown four needle-like fangs in her mouth, and her hands have become slicing claws.

She reverts to her original appearance when she dies.

## Bestowed Power

The malevolent powers bestowed to Kyrilla by her curse, as well as those given to her by the yuan-ti cult, are hardly of interest to her. She doesn't relish power but instead has taken to wallowing in misery and dwelling in her hatred for the beings that cursed her so long ago that she can hardly remember them.

## Magic Ring

Kyrilla wears a ring of water walking that she was given by an emissary from the Serpent Kingdoms long ago. It is made of a bluish jade and does not reflect light.

## Immortal Curse

Kyrilla does not require food or drink but does breathe and sleep.
