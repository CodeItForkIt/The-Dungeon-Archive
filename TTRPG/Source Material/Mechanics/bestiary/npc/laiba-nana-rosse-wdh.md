# [Laiba "Nana" Rosse](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/laiba-nana-rosse-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 116*  

Laiba Rosse, better known as "Nana," is the caretaker and private tutor for Terenzio and Elzerina, and she does her best to keep track of their every move. Even so, the two often sneak away from her watchful eye. Nana dresses in flowing red robes. She relaxes in the twins' playroom (area C17) when she's not with the children.
