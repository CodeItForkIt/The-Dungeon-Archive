# [Faldorn](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/faldorn-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 50*  

Faldorn is a human druid who is secretly a Shadow Master, one of the leaders of a militant sect of druids called the Shadow Druids. She is a devout follower of the beliefs of the Shadow Druids, believing that civilization is a cancer that threatens to make all the mortal races into weaklings.

Faldorn was born into the Black Raven Uthgardt tribe of the North. Her tribe resided within the Spine of the World, an icy mountain range in far northwest Faer√ªn. As an infant, Faldorn was offered to a Shadow Druid enclave and was later inducted into their ranks. Never knowing any other family, she grew to become a fervent worshipper of nature and the Shadow Druid's tenets. Over the decades, Faldorn rose through the ranks of her order until she eventually claimed leadership in a battle with the former Shadow Master. She returned to her Uthgardt tribe for a few years to take a husband, but abandoned him and the son that they had together after a few years.

Recently, Faldorn has taken it upon herself to infiltrate the Emerald Enclave. She joined the order and quickly rose through the ranks to become a Hierophant. She now is biding her time for one of the three members of the Elder Circle to die, so that she can take their place. Once she is a member of the Elder Circle, it will be easy for her to subvert the Emerald Enclave to do the bidding of the Shadow Druids. Her only worry is one of her former henchmen, an elven ranger named Kivan. He knows of her connections to the Shadow Druids and could potentially out her to the Elder Circle.

Faldorn is usually accompanied by corrupted fey creatures known as hamadryads. She claims that she is the only one willing to take in these sad creatures cast aside by nature.

## Faldorn as a Contact

Faldorn becomes available as a contact for the Emerald Enclave at 7th level. Faldorn can give you a small magic item that can be used to summon a powerful ally that will help you for 24 hours. You must use the item as described below to summon the ally. When the ally is summoned you must use an action and succeed at a [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion) check to convince it to help you. Faldorn gives these items for free, but she only grants each item once.
