- "desc": "Shards of a [vorpal sword](Mechanics/items/vorpal-sword.md) once broken\
    \ against the devil replace its claws. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana))\
    \ or Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check identifies\
    \ them as such. When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with a claw, the target\
    \ is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal an extra 6d8\
    \ slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing\
    \ damage, has legendary actions, doesn't have or need a head, or if you decide\
    \ that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by the devil's claws.\
    \ If removed, the shards lose their magical powers."
  "name": "Vorpal Claws"
- "desc": "Local teleportation-field bracelets encircle the devil's arms and tail.\

- "desc": "The Grand Master makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its\
    \ sting."

    \ (1d8 + 4) slashing damage."

- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13\
    \ (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target must\
    \ succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
