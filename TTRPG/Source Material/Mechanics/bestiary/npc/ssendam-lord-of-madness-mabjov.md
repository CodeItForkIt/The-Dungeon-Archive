> The lord of insanity is a difficult subject to find accurate information on. Mainly because most that encounter the primal slaad are left either catatonic, incoherent or psychotic. Ssendam is one of the two known slaadi lords, the other being Ygorl, lord of entropy. There are rumors of other slaadi that may rival the power of Ssendam and Ygorl. Netherese texts refer to them as void slaad and chronal slaad.

Ssendam is the Slaad Lord of Madness. She was born in the ancient days, when Primus, Lord of the Modrons, came to Limbo to bring order to chaos with his Spawning Stone. A shard of the Spawning Stone broke off in the god's hand and worked its way into his divine body. The wound made him feverish and clouded his thoughts; this was the first instance of what is now known as the chaos phage or "slaad fever".

Not wanting to bring the illness to his home plane of Mechanus, Primus purged himself before leaving Limbo. Not only did he expel the shard, but all the chaos that had touched his body, in a pile of vile excrement. Through the power of the Spawning Stone, this excrement transformed itself into the first slaadâ€”Ssendam.

Ssendam is not interested in the realm of Limbo. Her only desire is to spread sickness and madness. To this end she travels to different mortal worlds, bringing with her the chaos phage. She has two forms, that of a golden amoeba or alternatively that of a golden slaad. As an amoeba, Ssendam moves through the waters of a mortal world, looking for a perfect host. When she finds that host, she allows her target to consume her by drinking water or wine. She then infects her host's mind and slowly turns them toward madness. This madness leads to an obsession with the slaad, the chaos phage, and Limbo.

Eventually, the host will find a way to bring slaad into their world. When there are enough of her kind, Ssendam completes her corruption of the host and transforms into her golden slaad form, utterly consuming her unfortunate living vessel. Her only goal after this transformation is spread the chaos phage to all corners of the world she now inhabits.
