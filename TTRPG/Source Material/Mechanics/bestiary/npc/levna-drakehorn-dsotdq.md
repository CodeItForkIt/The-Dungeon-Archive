# [Levna Drakehorn](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/levna-drakehorn-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 213*  

Though a recent inductee into the Order of the Rose, [Levna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levna-drakehorn-dsotdq.md) is a confident, experienced Solamnic knight. She is brave, decisive, and deadly with her two-handed sword. After a chance encounter with agents of the Blue Dragon Army, Levna was left with a distinctive, branching scar. She claims it came from the breath of a blue dragon, but few of her fellow Knights of Solamnia believe her.
