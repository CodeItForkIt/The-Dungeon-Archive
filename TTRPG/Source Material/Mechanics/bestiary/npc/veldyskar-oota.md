- "desc": "If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of Veldyskar and the two of\
    \ them can see each other, Veldyskar can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution\
    \ saving throw if Veldyskar isn't [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\
    \ On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
    \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the\
    \ effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nA creature that isn't [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised)\
    \ can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it\
    \ does so, it can't see Veldyskar until the start of its next turn, when it can\
    \ avert its eyes again. If it looks at Veldyskar in the meantime, it must immediately\
    \ make the save.\n\nIf Veldyskar sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright\
    \ light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze."
