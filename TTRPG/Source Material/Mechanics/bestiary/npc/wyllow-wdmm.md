    \ Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains\
    \ any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class\
    \ features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that\
    \ it lacks. It can cast its spells with verbal or somatic components in its new\

    \ resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks."
