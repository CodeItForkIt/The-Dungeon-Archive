# [Malivar](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/malivar-aitfr-isf.md)
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: In Scarlet Flames p. 12*  

Malivar Kresk is a Red Wizard of Thay, a conjurer, and recent apprentice to the treacherous Red Wizard named Morwena. Young, pale white, plain, and slender, Malivar usually hates his own appearance but hopes his red robes and smooth scalp give him a "lean and mean" look.

Now alone on his mission, Malivar doesn't hesitate to use or abuse the trust of others if it means he can get revenge, return to Thay alive, and report on Morwena's betrayal.
