# [Belial](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/belial-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 221*  

Belial maintains his image as the most carnal of all archdevils, and enjoys inflicting pain as much as experiencing pleasure. Despite his indulgences, Belial demonstrates charisma, passion, and intelligence, and is almost always scheming. He is confident to a fault, with vanity and desire being his greatest weaknesses.

Phlegethos has been ruled by Belial, together with his daughter, Fierna, for almost as long as Dispater has ruled his Iron City. Belial considers himself an "old school" devil, alongside his friendly rivals Levistus and Dispater. Glasya's recent rise to power has him concerned for his continued relevance in the political landscape, forcing him to direct his scheming inwards.

During the Reckoning, Belial remained relatively neutral, until the end, when he allied with Baalzebul. Some argue that his alliance was just another scheme meant to misdirect Asmodeusâ€”an idea further cemented when, instead of being deposed, Belial was forced to cede the throne to his daughter. For a time, he continued to rule from the shadows, but influence from Glasya on Fierna has encouraged the fiery lord to rule in tandem. Belial manages much of the political and official sides of the realm, including maintaining the infernal court. He occasionally sends avatars to other planes, which quickly seek out pleasure before continuing their assigned task.

Similar to his daughter, Belial remains one of the most attractive archdevils. His rugged good looks and masculine physique serve to compliment his devilish features, of which he has many. Sharp horns and glowing eyes adorn his face, with midnight-black wings and a tail decorating the rest of his body. Depending on his mood, Belial's skin either takes on an ashy-grey complexion, or smolders red like dying coal. Priding himself on his sensual appearance, Belial dresses provocatively while maintaining high fashion, truly embodying his carnal desires.

## Belial's Lair

This fierce archdevil currently makes his lair in an obsidian palace built within the confines of Abriymoch, but his reach extends throughout the entirety of the city.
