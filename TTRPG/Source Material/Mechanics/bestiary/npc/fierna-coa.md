# [Fierna](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/fierna-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 225*  

Fierna rules Phlegethos alongside her father, Belial. She is emotionally intelligent, and her charisma has earned her many allies and few enemies in the Nine Hells. Although some view her as incompetent, Fierna's true intentions are hidden behind a smokescreen of brashness.

Her father, Belial, was a key player in the Reckoning, and due to his actions, Fierna was granted primary leadership of Phlegethos. Despite this political appearance, Fierna and Belial rule together, often meeting in secret to discuss strategy and upcoming plans. Some of the more ignorant archdevils view the relationship between Belial and Fierna as something to be exploited or broken. In reality, Fierna deeply respects her father, and the feeling is mutual.

Laying eyes on Fierna, one can immediately see the reasons she is so admired: she is impossibly beautiful. Her beauty is a strength, complementing her strategic mind and ingenuity.

## Fierna's Lair

Fierna's lair is a palace, a tower of crystalline stone wreathed in blue flame.
