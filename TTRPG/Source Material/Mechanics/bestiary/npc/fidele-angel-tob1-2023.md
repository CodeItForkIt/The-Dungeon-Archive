# [Fidele Angel](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/fidele-angel-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 19*  

*What appears to be a mated pair of birds changes into two bestial celestials that move in perfect harmony.*

Fidele angels form from souls so devoted to each other that their love transcends death.

## Friends to Lovers

Fideles are charged with exhorting mortals to respect the bonds of partnership. They assist lovers facing obstacles and punish the enemies of love. Where there is a conflict between two cultures' laws in love, they prefer the result that keeps lovers together.

## Quiet Diplomats

They prefer diplomacy to force and, despite the urgency of love, they've been known to live secretly among mortals for years or decades while waging quiet campaigns against social mores and cultural norms that keep love from achieving its full potential.
