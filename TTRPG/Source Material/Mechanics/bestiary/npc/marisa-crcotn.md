- "desc": "Marisa enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\
    \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and\
    \ vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of Marisa that can see it must\
    \ succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 Ã— 10\
    \ years. A [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) target can repeat\
    \ the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or\
    \ the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage\
    \ for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a  [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring."
  "name": "Horrifying Visage"
- "desc": "One humanoid that Marisa can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a\
    \ DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by Marisa; Marisa then disappears,\
    \ and the target is [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ and loses control of its body. Marisa now controls the body but doesn't deprive\
    \ the target of awareness. Marisa can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other\
    \ effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It otherwise uses\
    \ the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,\
    \ class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the body drops\
    \ to 0 hit points, Marisa ends it as a bonus action, or Marisa is turned or forced\
    \ out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, Marisa reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours\
    \ after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
