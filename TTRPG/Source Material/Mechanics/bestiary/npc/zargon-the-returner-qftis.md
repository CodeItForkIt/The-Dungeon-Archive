# [Zargon the Returner](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/zargon-the-returner-qftis.md)
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 223*  

Zargon the Returner is an elder evil—an undying abomination from eons past with an insatiable appetite. A tentacled, slime-covered horror with a cyclopic red eye and an indestructible horn, Zargon corrupts creatures it doesn't devour, transforming its victims into amorphous servants.

No one knows Zargon's true origin. The creature was one of the first inhabitants of the Nine Hells, predating even the arrival of Asmodeus, the plane's foremost ruler. Long-lived devils and occult sages theorize Zargon and its kind were invaders from another plane—or another reality entirely.

When Asmodeus ascended the infernal hierarchy, he and his legions wiped out most of the plane's earlier inhabitants, but Zargon proved beyond even Asmodeus' might. No matter what blistering wrath Asmodeus brought to bear on Zargon, the aberration continually re-formed from its horn. Finally, Asmodeus cast Zargon's horn from the Nine Hells in disgust, banishing the elder evil to the Material Plane. The horn was driven deep into the earth where it fell, entombing Zargon below.

Eventually a civilization arose above Zargon's prison. The elder evil whispered through dreams and nightmares to the people of Cynidicea, the realm's capital, until one day, a crew of Cynidiceans accidentally dug through to the Returner's prison. Zargon emerged, devouring many of the city's inhabitants and drowning many more in its slime. The city soon fell. Those who survived Zargon's rampage turned to it in worship, sacrificing their own to appease their so-called god. Appeased by these living offerings, Zargon returned to the tunnels beneath Cynidicea, where its cult grew.

## Zargon's Lair

Zargon's lair is a slimy cavern beneath the lost city of Cynidicea. The elder evil lurks in the depths, feasting on sacrifices cast down by its worshipers.

    \ is immune to all damage and can be destroyed only by submerging it in a cleansing\
    \ waterfall on one of the Upper Planes for 101 days. While the horn is submerged\
    \ in this way, Zargon doesn't re-form, and the horn slowly dissolves, sending\
    \ corrupting slime downriver that permanently fouls the water for 10 miles from\
    \ the place where the horn dissolved. The fouled water is unfit to drink, chokes\

  "name": "Gore"
- "desc": "Zargon spews slime in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't\
    \ an Aberration or Ooze must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, the creature takes 38 (7d10) acid damage and has the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much\
    \ damage only. A [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature can\
    \ repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on\
    \ itself on a success.\n\nA creature reduced to 0 hit points by the acid damage\
    \ dies and dissolves into a puddle of slime that rises as a gibbering mouther\
    \ at the start of Zargon's next turn. The creature obeys Zargon's commands and\
    \ takes its turn immediately after Zargon's. Only a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md)\

- "desc": "When a creature casts a spell that targets Zargon or would deal damage\
    \ to it, Zargon attempts to absorb the magic into its horn. The creature must\

    \ force damage, and the spell it cast fails and is wasted."
  "name": "Defiant Essence"
- "desc": "When a creature ends its turn within 30 feet of Zargon, Zargon sprays toxic\
