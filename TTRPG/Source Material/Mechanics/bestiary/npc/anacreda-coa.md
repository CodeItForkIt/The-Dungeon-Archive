    \ within a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on Anacreda must make a DC 18 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. A creature takes 55 (10d10) thunder damage on a failed save,\
    \ or half as much damage on a successful one. Unworked stone, exposed bone, and\
    \ similar materials in the radius are shattered and turned into difficult terrain."
