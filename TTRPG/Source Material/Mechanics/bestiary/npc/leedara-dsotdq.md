# [Leedara](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/leedara-dsotdq.md)
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 58*  

Leedara died during the Cataclysm over three hundred years ago. Once an elven priest, Leedara witnessed her companion and fellow priest, Isolde, drawn into the grim fate of the wicked Knight of Solamnia, Lord Loren Soth. When Soth failed his gods-given quest to prevent the Cataclysm, he became cursed to exist forever as a death knight. As part of his curse, Leedara and several of her companions returned as deathless spirits devoted to ensuring Soth never finds peace.

  "name": "Horrifying Visage"
- "desc": "One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on\

    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). She otherwise uses\
    \ the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,\
    \ class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the body drops\
    \ to 0 hit points, Leedara ends it as a bonus action, or Leedara is turned or\
    \ forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, Leedara reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to Leedara's Possession for 24 hours\
    \ after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
