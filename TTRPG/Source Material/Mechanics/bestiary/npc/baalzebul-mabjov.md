Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he has been cursed with a new hideous form by the Lord of the Nine Hells—Asmodeus. This form has earned him a new title—The Slug Archduke.

Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch.

However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted. Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil. Any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him.

Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even if trapped in the form of a slug, he is still the Lord of Lies, whose every deception is made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind. Only other devils are safe from his lies, as Baalzebul wishes to return to his original beautiful form.

If forced into combat Baalzebul's first tactic is to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies. Baalzebul's stench is so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him is sickening. Despite his bloated form, he can still burrow underground and easily scale surfaces. He is easy to track, since he always leaves a thick layer of putrid slime in his wake.
