Cryonax, the Prince of Evil Ice Creatures, is an elemental prince of evil from the Plane of Ice. Cryonax appears as a hulking simian beast that stands about fifteen feet tall. Shaggy white fur covers his powerfullybuilt humanoid body. Instead of arms, he has a pair of long, suckered, tentacles. The air around him is frigid and cold as death itself.

The elemental princes of evil are ancient elemental beings that wield immense power. Each one of them commands countless twisted and evil elementals and is worshipped by insane cultists on the mortal world. Unlike the princes that are embodiments of the four base elements, Cryonax draws power from multiple elements. For this reason, some feel that Cryonax is the favorite prince of the Elder Elemental Eye. The Eye is a dark, primordial god that corrupted the elements in the beginning of the world, giving rise to each of the princes.

Cryonax seeks to turn the multiverse into ice. To this end, he strives to unleash eternal winter upon entire worlds. When he comes to a realm, he schemes to prevent the coming of summer, dim the light of a world's sun, and extend the glaciers of a world's polar regions through weather control magic.

Cryonax rules the Frostfell, also known as the Plane of Ice. It is a place of pure, bone-chilling cold. Cryonax resides in the Chiseled Estate; a massive fortress constructed of ice, rock, crystal, and glass that rises a mile above the surface of Frostfell's glaciers.
