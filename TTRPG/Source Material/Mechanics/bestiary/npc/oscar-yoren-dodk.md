# [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md)
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 99*  

This malfeasant wizard fled the Amethyst Academy ten years ago. Oscar Yoren has since taken up residence on the north side of Drakkenheim in Reed Manor, and survived on the outskirts of the city through his grim intellect, ruthless self-interest, and willingness to practice unsavoury forms of alchemy and necromancy. Several other outcast mages have since joined him as apprentices.

Oscar Yoren is a short, wide man in his mid-fifties. He wears slovenly leather breeches and a filthy black overcoat. He has shoulder-length greasy black hair and a thick beard of wiry unshaven hair creeping down his flabby neck. His skin is covered in sores and pasty blotches, with bulging blood veins under his neck. His sunken bloodshot eyes glare with a purple-green light. He has yellow teeth and fingernails.

-     - **Personality Trait.** I talk down to anyone who isn't as intelligent as I am - which is everyone. I demand attention when I'm speaking, and make thinly-veiled threats when I don't get my way.    
-     - **Ideal.** The Amethyst Academy doesn't understand my methods, but I cannot unlock the secrets of delerium if I am hindered by petty morality and useless ethics. If I had proper facilities and resources, unimaginable power would be mine.    
-     - **Bond.** My apprentices are useful as long as they are loyal and don't question me, but disposable the moment they aren't. Only my own survival matters.    
-     - **Flaw.** I hold vindictive grudges against everyone who ever wronged me. I'll have my revenge someday, but I fear acting against those with more power or resources than me. I must hide for now, as I'm terrified the Academy will send assassins to kill me and steal my brilliant research.    

Oscar Yoren's spellbook contains all the spells he has prepared, plus alarm, find familiar, glyph of warding, contact other plane, dispel magic, dimension door, magic circle, and planar binding.
