# [Remallia Haventree](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/remallia-haventree-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 214*  

Remallia (Remi to her friends) is the lady of House Ulbrinter and a guiding light for the Harpers in Waterdeep

She became an active force for good in the city after assassins killed her husband, Arthagast Ulbrinter, and destroyed his remains. A sun elf, she has two adult children (a half-elf son named Arthius, who is studying music in Silverymoon, and a half-elf daughter named Serenore, who lives on the Moonshae island of Alaron with her husband and daughter). Lady Haventree retains a handful of loyal servants and spies.

Remi holds secret Harper meetings in her villa, which is warded by all manner of spells. She uses a silver raven figurine of wondrous power to deliver messages to Harper spies scattered throughout the city.
