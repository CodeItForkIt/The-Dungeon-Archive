# [Hraesvelgr](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/hraesvelgr-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 207*  

*The giant stands braced in the midst of powerful wind. With a baleful stare, he shakes his fist and bellows a war cry. The cry becomes an avian shriek, and the giant's form melts into that of a massive bird whose wings blot out the sky*.

A giant with divine blood in his veins, Hraesvelgr the Corpse Swallower is powerfully muscled. His skin is a pale bronze, his eyes are violet, and his hair is the color of storm clouds.

## Roc Form

When he takes his alternate form, Hraesvelgr becomes a tremendous roc, with massive wings that stir the wind across the sky. His eyes remain the same violet and these roc-form feathers match the color of his hair, sparkling with specks of color here and there, like jewels set in steel.

## Birth of the Wind

Hraesvelgr dwells on the fringe of the world itself. From atop the peak of his home, he creates the wind and sends it across the globe. As befits a creature of such primal power, Hraesvelgr doesn't take kindly to intruders. He gluts himself on the bodies of fools who test his might in search of the fabled riches in his home.

## Hraesvelgr's Lair

Hraesvelgr's lair is a windswept crag of gray stone at the edge of the world. At the highest pinnacle rests a massive cottage hewn from the mountainside. A great nest made from the splintered trunks of immense trees rests on the flat roof of the cottage, and the wind constantly howls.
