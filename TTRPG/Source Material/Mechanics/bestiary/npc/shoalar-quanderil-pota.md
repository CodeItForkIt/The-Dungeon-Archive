# [Shoalar Quanderil](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/shoalar-quanderil-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 208*  

A plump water genasi armed with a jovial manner and biting sense of humor, Shoalar Quanderil seems like the last person one would expect to be a cruel member of a destructive cult. Nevertheless, Shoalar is the captain of a pirate ship that harries the Sword Coast, and a high-ranking Crushing Wave cultist. He sees Olhydra's power as a means to making himself as rich as possible.
