# [Preeta Kreepa](Mechanics\bestiary\npc/preeta-kreepa-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 56*  

Mages spend their lives in the study and practice of magic. Good-aligned mages offer counsel to nobles and others in power, while evil mages dwell in isolated sites to perform unspeakable experiments without interference.

Preeta served as an assistant to Arcturia, one of Halaster's apprentices, until Arcturia transformed her into a monstrous horror. Preeta looks like an old woman with two beholder eyestalks sprouting from her eye sockets. Her mouth, twice as large as it should be, is filled with sharp, pointed teeth. She wears the flayed, slippery, translucent skin of a kuo-toa as a cloak.
