  "name": "Ethereal Sight"
- "desc": "Thorn can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult\
    \ terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object."
  "name": "Incorporeal Movement"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17\
    \ (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage."
  "name": "Withering Touch"
- "desc": "Thorn enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\
    \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and\
    \ vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "One humanoid that Thorn can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC\
    \ 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by Thorn; Thorn then disappears, and\
    \ the target is [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and\
    \ loses control of its body. Thorn now controls the body but doesn't deprive the\
    \ target of awareness. Thorn can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other\
    \ effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It otherwise uses\
    \ the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,\
    \ class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession lasts until the body drops\
    \ to 0 hit points, Thorn ends it as a bonus action, or Thorn is turned or forced\
    \ out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, Thorn reappears in an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours\
    \ after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."
