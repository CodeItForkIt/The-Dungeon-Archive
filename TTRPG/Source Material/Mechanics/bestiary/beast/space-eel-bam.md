# [Space Eel](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/space-eel-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 55*  

Space eels avoid confrontations with larger creatures unless the eels are starving. These 5-foot-long scavengers might trail a spelljamming ship and feed on barnacles they detach from the ship's hull. Wildspace hunters try to catch and kill the eels for their meatâ€”a task easier to describe than to accomplish.
