# [Ychen Bannog](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/ychen-bannog-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 401*  

*The massive oxen shakes its head, sending a flock of birds flying. It groans out a yawn that sets nearby trees rattling.*

Ychen bannogs are massive, ox-like beasts with thick, wooly coats and great horns like the gods' battering rams. They stand over forty feet tall at the shoulder and weigh hundreds of tons. Despite their awe-inspiring size, these towering creatures are peaceful wanderers in the wilderness, where their calls echo for miles.

## Strongest Beasts in the World

Legends are built on the sturdy backs of ychen bannog. They are the strongest beasts of burden in the known world. Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a ychen bannog at its disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds, haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.

## Ychen Warships

Giants have a particular affinity with the ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for generations.

## Louder Than Thunder

When riled, an ychen bannog can bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.
