# [Frilled Deathspitter](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/frilled-deathspitter-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 30*  

The dinosaurs aptly known as deathspitters can spit venom to blind their prey before closing in for the kill.

## Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are the dominant form of animal life in Ixalanâ€”the absolute rulers of the coastal lands held by the Sun Empire, and a force to be reckoned with in the interior jungles. A number of dinosaurs appear in the "Monster Manual", with even more to be found in "Volo's Guide to Monsters", making that a particularly worthwhile resource for an Ixalan campaign. (Many of the dinosaurs in "Volo's Guide" also appear in Tomb of Annihilation.)
