*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 334*  

*The vicious snake with a squat, diamond-shaped head, a puffed neck, and a peculiar yellow band around its body slithered slowly through the marsh.*

## Marsh Hunter

This venomous snake—sometimes known as the "speckled band"—is native to the marshes of southern realms, where it devours waterfowl and incautious halflings.

## Bred for Venom

The swamp adder is simultaneously feared and prized for its potent paralytic venom. A swamp adder is quite thin, and the largest weigh as much as 50 pounds. A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more in some markets.
