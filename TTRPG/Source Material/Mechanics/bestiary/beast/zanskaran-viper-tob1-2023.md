*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 334*  

*Greenish liquid drips from the dagger-length fangs of this monstrously large snake.*

## Human Hunters

This giant venomous snake is known as one of the most lethal serpents, and one of the few that will attack an adult human. One bite from the Zanskaran viper can kill a healthy human in seconds, and its tough hide makes it difficult to dispatch quickly.

## Jungle Bred

A Zanskaran viper grows quickly in its jungle home, and some even venture into the savannah to terrorize antelopes and young giraffes. A full-grown Zanskaran viper is up to 30 feet long and weighs up to 400 pounds.

## Famous but Rare Venom

A dose of its viscous green venom is known to fetch as much as 2,500 gp in some markets.
