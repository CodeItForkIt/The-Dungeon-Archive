# [Titanoboa](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/titanoboa-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 363*  

*This titanic green serpent raises its enormous head high, its body extending in seemingly endless coils.*

## Territorial and Aggressive

Territorial and voracious, the rare titanoboa devours all trespassers in its domain. Stronger and faster than the giant anaconda, the true king of the rainforest is also more stubborn, fighting off entire groups of hunters and poachers. When stalking prey, these great serpents strike from ambush, swallowing even some dinosaurs in one bite.

## Blinding Scales

Against groups of foes, titanoboas trust in their ability to dazzle their enemies with the light reflected from their scales, using this distraction to entwine the stunned foes in crushing coils.

## Slow to Mate

Titanoboas mate rarely. They live for hundreds of years and never stop growing, which makes the need for propagation less urgent. When two titanoboas nest, the result is a brood of a half-dozen smaller snakes. An adult titanoboa is at least 80 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds or more.
