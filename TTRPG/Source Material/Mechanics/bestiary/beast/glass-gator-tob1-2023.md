# [Glass Gator](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/glass-gator-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 211*  

*A near-transparent crocodilian creature leaps from the water, the remnants of its last meal still visible in its transparent gut.*

## Strange Anatomy

The body of a glass gator is most similar to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more distinct head. Once the glass gator gets hold of prey, it wraps its body around the victim and squeezes, like a constrictor snake. Unlike a serpent, however, which uses powerful muscles to crush and suffocate its prey, the glass gator is only trying to bring its underbelly into contact with the prey. The glass gator's belly is lined with hundreds of stingers that deliver a virulent nerve toxin.

## Transparency

The glass gator's transparency isn't total. Its digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most vulnerable just after eating, when it's lethargic.

## Larval Form

Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It's been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.
