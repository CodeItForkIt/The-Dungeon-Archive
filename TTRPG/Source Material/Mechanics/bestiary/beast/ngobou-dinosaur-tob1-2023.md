# [Ngobou Dinosaur](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/ngobou-dinosaur-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 102*  

*This ill-tempered, six-horned creature resembles a triceratops the size of an ox, with pairs of horns atop its nose and brows, as well as great tusks jutting from each side of its mouth.*

## Hatred of Elephants

Ngobous are ox-sized dinosaurs often at war with elephants over territory. Ngobous are irascible and suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of elephant scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou's rage.

## Poor Beasts of War

Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on the ill-tempered animals. Most believe the ngobou's behavior is too erratic, especially if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.

## Trample Crops

Stampeding ngobou herds can smash fields of crops flat in minutes, and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or cattle in little time.
