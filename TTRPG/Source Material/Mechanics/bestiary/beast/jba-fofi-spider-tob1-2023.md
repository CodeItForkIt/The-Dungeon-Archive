# [J'ba Fofi Spider](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/jba-fofi-spider-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 344*  

*A large, brown spider that resembles a tarantula with exaggeratedly long legs gracefully emerges from the bushes, followed by similar arachnids that are smaller and yellow in color.*

The j'ba fofi resembles an oversized tarantula with very long legs, although a flicker of intelligence indicates this species evolved above mere vermin.

## Spider Pack Leaders

The youngest are yellow in color, but their hairs turn brown as they age. Immature j'ba fofi pull ordinary spiders into their fellowship in teeming masses that follow along wherever they roam.

## Fond of Camouflage

The natural coloring of a j'ba fofi, along with its habit to cover its hair-like bristles in a layer of leaves makes it virtually invisible in its natural environment. They weave leaves and other forest litter into their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.
