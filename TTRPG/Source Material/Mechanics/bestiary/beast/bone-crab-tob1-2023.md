## Skull Shells

Much like an enormous hermit crab, bone crabs inhabit the remains of large fish, humanoids, and other creatures. A bone crab's spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter, cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. They drag aquatic prey above the high tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. The crabs can pick corpses clean in a few hours, and their hunting grounds are littered with cracked and sun-bleached bones—the perfect hiding place for these littoral predators.

## Scavengers of Memory

Bone crabs are voracious scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on the brains. Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.

## Pack Hunters

Bone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures stranded in tidal pools. Centuries of feeding on brains has left the crabs with a rudimentary intelligence and a psychic connection with fellow packmates. They use this to alert each other to danger, potential prey, or a threat to their territory. Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while ignoring the area's regulars.

## White Ghost Shivers

Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease known as white ghost shivers. This disease wracks victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a bone crab's unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it.
