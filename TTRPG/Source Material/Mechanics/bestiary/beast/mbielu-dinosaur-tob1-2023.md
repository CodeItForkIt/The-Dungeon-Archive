# [Mbielu Dinosaur](Mechanics\bestiary\beast/mbielu-dinosaur-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 101*  

*This lumbering saurian quadruped has large, oblong plates of bone covered in greenish slime protruding from its back and its thick, club-like tail.*

## Large Plates

People describe this reptilian herbivore as "the animal with planks growing out of its back." The mbielu is a large dinosaur akin to a stegosaurus, with square dorsal plates that support symbiotic colonies of toxic, green algae. The plates themselves are as large as shields.

## Aquatic Herbivore

An mbielu spends most of its life underwater, feeding on aquatic plants and avoiding the withering glare of the harsh sun, but it comes onto land frequently to sun itself for a few hours before immersing itself once again.

## Toxic Alchemy

Its dorsal plate algae undergo an alchemical reaction in the continual transition between water and sky, especially during mbielu migrations to new watery dens. The algae produce a hallucinogenic poison that clouds the minds of most creatures. Mbielus themselves are immune to the toxin.
