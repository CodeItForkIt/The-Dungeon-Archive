# [Drowned Maiden](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/drowned-maiden-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 149*  

*A drowned woman floating in the water, her long hair drifting around her, suddenly rises! Her hair strikes out like dozens of watery snakes.*

## Raging Romantics

Drowned maidens are piteous, but terrifying, undead. They are created when a woman dies in water due to a doomed romance, often from unrequited love or drowned by a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death, seeking vengeance. Even as she dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden anguishes over her tragic fate.

## Beckoning for Help

The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she diedâ€”usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned. Using her ability to disguise herself as a living person, she silently beckons victims from afar, acting as if in danger of drowning. When a victim is within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to drain its strength with a magical kiss. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim's final vision is the drowned maiden's tearful lament over the loss of life.

## Death to Betrayers

Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens. Sometimes maidens release pleading victims who promise to return to her lair with the person who caused the maiden's death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath.
