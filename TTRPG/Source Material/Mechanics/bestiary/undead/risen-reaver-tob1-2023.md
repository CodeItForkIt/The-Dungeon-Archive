# [Risen Reaver](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/risen-reaver-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 309*  

*A body that might once have been human now has four legs and nightmarishly long, thick arms. What's worse, its skin has been flayed off, revealing the dead muscle and sinew beneath.*

## Spirt of War

The risen reaver is an undead creature born from a warrior fallen on the battlefield. Its body becomes an avatar of combat, with four legs and a pair of long, heavy arms. In the process, it sheds its skin, becoming entirely undead muscle, bone, and sinew.

## Absorb Weapons

When risen reavers take form, they absorb all weapons around them. Some of these weapons pierce their bodies, while others become part of the risen reaver's armament. Their four legs are tipped with blades on which they walk like metallic spiders. Their arms are covered in weaponry infused into their flesh, which they use to crush and flay any living creatures they encounter

## Battle Mad

Risen reavers are battle-maddened spirits of vengeance and slaughter, obsessed with the chaos of combat that led to their own death. They hunt the living with the sole purpose of killing, and they thrive on violence and murder. As they died, so should others die.

    \ of damage dealt by that weapon, and when it hits with its Bladed Fist, the fist\
    \ deals an extra 2 1d4 damage of the type dealt by the weapon. The reaver can\
