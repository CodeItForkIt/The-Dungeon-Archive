# [Necrohydra](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/necrohydra-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 283*  

*Five snaking necks sprout from this decayed, draconic body. However, instead of reptilian heads, each neck ends in a humanoid head.*

Necrohydras are created by powerful, evil necromancers and often used as guardians or placed at the vanguard of an undead army to strike fear and despair into the enemy. The wordless, heart-wrenching dirge the creature produces can drain all hope from listeners. The necrohydra can speak, though the few words it croaks out are usually only in response to questions by its master.

## Familiar Heads

Sometimes a necrohydra is created as an instrument of revenge or a tool to further damage the morale of a necromancer's enemies. In these instances, the necromancer uses the heads of humanoids that are familiar to those that will face the necrohydraâ€”heroes, beloved leaders or officers, loved ones, or close allies. A necromancer may coach the necrohydra to say certain mocking phrases to strike at the hearts of the necromancer's enemies.

    \ Dirge. At the end of its turn, it grows two skeletal heads for each of its fleshy\
    \ heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken radiant damage since\
