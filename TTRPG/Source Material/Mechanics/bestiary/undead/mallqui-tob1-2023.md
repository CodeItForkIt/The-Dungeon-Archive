# [Mallqui](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/mallqui-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 261*  

*With skin stretched like vellum over wizened limbs, a desiccated humanoid form clad in splendid regalia emerges from a funerary tower. The imposing figure has yellow points of light for eyes.*

## Cold Plateau Mummies

The people of the cold, rainless, mountain plateaus take advantage of their dry climes to mummify their honored dead, but without the embalming and curing of the corpse practiced in hotter lands. To preserve the knowledge and the place of their ancestors in the afterlife, their dead remain among them as counsellors and honorees on holy days.

## Undead Judges

The mallqui are not seen as malevolent, though at times they are severe judges against transgressors of their culture's ideals.

## Icons of Growth

Through their ability to draw the very moisture from the air, they are seen as conduits to the fertility of the earth. Mallqui also means "sapling" in the language of the people who create them.
