# [Wormhearted Suffragan](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/wormhearted-suffragan-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 398*  

*Robes cover the rotting flesh and lifeless gray hair of this humanoid. Fine, arm-length worms wriggle through abscesses in its flesh and its empty eye-sockets, and it moves with a stooped, shuffling gait.*

Wormhearted suffragans are devoted followers of [Tooltip Not Found], Demon Lord of Worms, who they believe is the servant and forerunner of a dark goddess of worms and decay.

## Dark Worm Hearts

Formerly, the suffragans were priests or holy officers of other faiths, but their hearts were corrupted by their fear and loathing. Once pledged to the service of the devouring worm, Qorgeth replaced their hearts with a bulbous, writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to carry on with an undead mockery of life.

## Prey on the Wounded

Suffragans frequently follow armies, visiting battlefields shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of gravediggers, nurses, or chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead and dying for as long as they can remain undetected, spreading their worms to create new servants for their demon lord.

## Fear Light and Radiance

Wormhearted suffragans are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing power of light. For this reason, they avoid priests of the sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking contagion, infesting enemies with parasitic worms that devour victims from within.
