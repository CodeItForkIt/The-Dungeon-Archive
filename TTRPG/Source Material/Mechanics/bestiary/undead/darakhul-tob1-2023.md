*Intelligence gleams in the eyes of the well-dressed ghoul. It smiles a greeting, barely revealing sharp teeth.*

## Imperial Cunning

In the lightless depths, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. They call themselves the People, but the people of the surface world call them the Lords Subterranean, the Ghoul Imperium, or simply the Empire of the Ghouls. To them, if you are not a member of the People, you are food.

> [!note] Darakhul Fever
> 
> Spread mainly through bite wounds, this disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. An infected creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save, the victim takes 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the victim finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The victim recovers from the disease by making two consecutive successful saving throws. Greater restoration cures the disease, while lesser restoration gives the victim advantage on the next saving throw. Primarily spread among Humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other Giants may be susceptible. If a creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll a `d20`, add the character's Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table below to determine what Undead form the victim's body rises in.
> 
> | Roll | Result |
> |------|--------|
> | 1-9 | None; victim is simply dead |
> | 10-16 | Ghoul |
> | 17-20 | Ghast |
> | 21+ | Darakhul |
