# [Lich Hound](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/lich-hound-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 253*  

*Half bone, half purple fire, this deathly hound releases an eerie howl that echoes with the voices of the damned.*

## Fiery Bones

Bright white skulls with a heavy jaw and thick, robust skeletal bodies define the ferocious lich hounds. Their eyes burn green or blue, and their tongues resemble black fire. Fueled by necromantic power, these creatures are loyal servants of undead high priests or liches.

## Echoing Howls

Even on their own, lich hounds are relentless hunters, pursuing their prey with powerful senses and a keen ability to find the living wherever the creatures may hide. Lich hound howls fade into and out of normal hearing, with strangely shifted pitch and echoes.

## Murdered Celestials

The dark process of creating a lich hound involves a perverse ritual of first summoning a celestial canine and binding it to the Material Plane. The hound's future master then murders the trapped beast. Only then can the creature be animated in all its unholy glory. Houndlike celestials have long been outraged by the creation of lich hounds, and every few centuries, they band together to rid the world of those practicing this particular dark magic. Inevitably some knowledge survives this purge, leaving lich hounds a constant, painful reality for the celestials.
