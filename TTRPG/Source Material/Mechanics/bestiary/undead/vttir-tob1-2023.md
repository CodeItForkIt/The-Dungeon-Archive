# [Vættir](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/vttir-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 378*  

*The creature's blue-black skin is stretched taut over its bones, and its lips are drawn back in a cruel grimace. It holds a bronze axe high over its head, and its eyes glow an icy blue.*

## Servants of the Land

Servants of the land, vættir haunt those who disrespect the wild or ancient laws and traditions. Regardless of where they're found, vættir always wear ancient mail and carry bronze axes.

## Jealous and Wrathful

A wrathful vættir rises from its burial mound when its grave goods are stolen or when it is disrespected. Vættir jealously guard both honor and treasures, and they may be relentless enemies over matters as small as an accidental word or a single coin.

## Dangerous Helpers

Vættirs will answer a summons for aid by descendants or nearby villages. Summoned vættir wander into longhouses or taverns and sit down beside those who call them, ready to serve. However, there's always a price, and a vættir's help is often more than bargained for.
