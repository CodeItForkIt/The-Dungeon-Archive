# [Deathwisp](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/deathwisp-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 71*  

*A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light.*

## Fey Undead

A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.

## Rift Walkers

Many deathwisps remain among the shadows, but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates or by walking along the shadowy roads between the worlds. Retaining only a trace of their former personality and knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.

## Devour Breath

A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living things, and it invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary, intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against greater numbers.
