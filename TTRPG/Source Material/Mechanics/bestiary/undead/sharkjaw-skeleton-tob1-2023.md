# [Sharkjaw Skeleton](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/sharkjaw-skeleton-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 329*  

*A skeletal humanoid made entirely of shark's jaws steps out from the water, dripping strands of seaweed.*

Made from numerous, interlocking shark's jaws, these horrors are animated through foul magic into a large, vaguely humanoid shape. Sahuagin priests animate them to guard sepulchers of bones. These sharkjaw skeletons lie among great piles of bones, waiting to rise up and attack any uninvited souls who invade the sanctity of sahuagin holy sites. Others guard pirate treasures or ancient shipwrecks.

## Undead Automaton

Sharkjaw skeletons do nothing without orders from their creator, and they follow those instructions explicitly. A sharkjaw skeleton's creator can give it new commands while near the skeleton. Otherwise, a sharkjaw skeleton follows its last instructions to the best of its ability and to the exclusion of all else, though it fights back if attacked.
