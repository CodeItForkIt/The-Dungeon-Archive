# [Swarm of Wolf Spirits](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/swarm-of-wolf-spirits-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 358*  

*A pack of ghostly wolves appears in a swirl of greenish fog, coalescing from the fog itself.*

When a pack of wolves dies of hunger or chill in the deep winter, sometimes the pack leader's rage at a cruel death—or the summoning call of a necromancer—brings the entire pack back to the mortal world as a slavering pack of greenish, translucent apparitions that glides swiftly over snow and ice, or even rivers and lakes.

## Dozen-Eyed Hunters

At night such a swarm can appear as little more than a mass of swirling mist, but when it prepares to attack, the mist condenses into a dozen or more snarling wolf heads with glowing red eyes that trail off into tendrils of fog. A wolf spirit swarm does not eat, but the urge to hunt and kill is as strong as ever.

## Absorb Their Kill

Most such swarms serve powerful undead, warlocks, noctiny, or orcish shamans as guardians and enforcers, terrifying horses and henchmen alike. The souls of those slain by the pack are said to join it.

## Howl Before Combat

Hirelings, mounts, and familiars often panic at the sound of a spirit pack's chilling howl. Packs of wolf spirits are canny enough to always howl for a time before rushing a herd or encampment.
