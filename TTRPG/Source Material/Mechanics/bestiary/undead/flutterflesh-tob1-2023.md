# [Flutterflesh](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/flutterflesh-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 189*  

*This mass of fused corpses resembles a butterfly with wings of skin, limbs of bone, and a head formed of several different skulls. The dark magic that formed this abomination swirls around it hungrily.*

## Bound by Necromancy

Flutterfleshes are created in terrible necromantic rituals. Cultists gather in the name of a dark god, powerful lich, or crazed madman, and forever bind themselves body and soul into a single evil being. Flutterfleshes take recently severed limbs and fuse these new pieces to themselves in accordance with some unknowable aesthetic.

## Dilemma of Flesh

The most horrifying thing about a flutterflesh, however, is its devious nature. A flutterflesh offers its prey the choice to either die or lose a limb. If it accepts the limb, the flutterflesh then leaves the victim alone. One can always tell where a flutterflesh resides because so many of the locals are missing appendages.
