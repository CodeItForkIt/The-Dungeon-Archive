# [Beheaded Vengeful Spirit](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/beheaded-vengeful-spirit-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 384*  

*The ghostly humanoid floats through the air, its head hovering several inches above its severed neck.*

A vengeful spirit is created when a strong-willed humanoid with magical talent is killed by relatively mundane means wielded by angry or fearful people. The victim's angry spirit returns, looking for retribution against those involved in its death—whether that death was wrongful murder or justified execution. These spirits inflict punishment on the living with the rage that animates them, and they mete out their revenge in poetic fashion.

## Varied Vengeance

A vengeful spirit is defined by its means of death. Regardless of the cause of death, each vengeful spirit seeks to have its killer or killers die in like fashion.
