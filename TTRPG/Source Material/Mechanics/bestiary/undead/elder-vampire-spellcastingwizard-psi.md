  "name": "Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at\
    \ least 1 hit point. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water,\
    \ this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn."
  "name": "Regeneration"
"actions":
- "desc": "The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8\
    \ (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple\
    \ the target (escape DC 13)."
  "name": "Claws"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature,\
    \ or a creature that is [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by\
    \ the vampire, [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or\
    \ [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained). Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3)\
    \ piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum\
    \ is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire\
    \ regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target\
    \ finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum\
    \ to 0."
  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "The vampire obscures its form with mind-affecting magic that makes others\
    \ perceive it as a beautiful human of the same size and shape. The illusion ends\
    \ if the vampire takes a bonus action to end it or if the vampire dies. A creature\
    \ that can see the vampire can take an action to visually inspect it, ending the\
    \ mental effect on itself and seeing the vampire's true form with a successful\
    \ DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check."
  "name": "Vampiric Glamer"
- "desc": "The vampire shrouds itself in a cloak of silence to a radius of 2 feet.\
    \ Within that radius, the effect is the same as the [silence](Mechanics/spells/silence.md)\
    \ spell."
