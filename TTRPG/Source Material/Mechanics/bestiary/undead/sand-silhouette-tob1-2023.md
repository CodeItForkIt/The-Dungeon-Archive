# [Sand Silhouette](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/sand-silhouette-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 312*  

*A person made of sand emerges from the dune, a sandstorm of wailing souls swirling around it.*

Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells, or the victims of a dune collapse.

## Sand Bodies

If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.

## Traceless Movement

Sand silhouettes glide through the sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even cautious travelers with sudden attacks from below.
