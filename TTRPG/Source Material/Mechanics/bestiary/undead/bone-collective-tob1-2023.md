# [Bone Collective](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/bone-collective-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 39*  

*Thousands of tiny bones coalesce into a humanoid form, then disperse in a clattering swarm the next moment. The bones rustle as the creature moves, a sound like sand sliding down a dune.*

## Spies and Sneaks

Bone collectives are not primarily fighters, preferring to spy and skulk. However, when cornered, they fight fearlessly, seeking to strip the flesh from their foes. They wear robes or cloaks to pass as humanoid, as they know that most creatures find them disturbing.

## Commanders and Servants of Undeath

Bone collectives' long finger bones and hooked claws help them ascend and control zombie mounts, and their magic allows them to control small groups of undead. This undead affinity occasionally leads them to serve as spies or spymasters for necromancers, darakhul, vampires, or liches.

## Feed on Society

Bone collectives join societies around them, whether human, goblin, or ghoul. They prey on the living and the dead, to replenish lost bones. They produce a reddish venom that drains the luster of life from victims. Those who survive can describe the horrifying red smile of the collective's venomâ€‘coated fangs.
