# [Putrid Haunt](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/putrid-haunt-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 296*  

*This shambling corpse has twigs, branches, and other debris intertwined with its body. Its gaping maw crawls with scrabbling vermin.*

## Swamp Undead

Putrid haunts are walking corpses infused with moss, mud, and the detritus of the deep swamp. They are the shambling remains of individuals who, either through mishap or misdeed, died while lost in a vast swampland. Their desperate need to escape the marshland in life transforms into a hatred of all living beings in death. They often gather in places tainted by evil deeds.

## Mossy Islands

When no potential victims are nearby, putrid haunts sink into the water and muck, where moss and water plants grow over them and vermin inhabit their rotting flesh. When living creatures draw near, the dormant putrid haunt bursts from its watery hiding spot and attacks its prey, stomping foes deep into the muck. There's no planning and little cunning in their assault, but they move through the marshes more freely than most intruders, and they attack with a single-mindedness that's easily mistaken for purpose.

## Harbor Vermin

Putrid haunt corpses create favorable conditions for leeches, insects, and other swamp vermin. They are often hosts or hiding places for large gatherings of such creatures.
