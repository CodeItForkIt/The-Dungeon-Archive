# [Venomous Mummy](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/venomous-mummy-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 279*  

*This shambling corpse warrior is draped in stained linen wrappings. Green liquid drips from rents in the fabric.*

## Servant of the Scorpion Goddess

These mummies are crafted by the faithful of a goddess of poison and scorpions to guard holy sites and tombs and to serve as agents of the goddess's retribution. Should the goddess's faithful feel themselves slighted by an individual or a community, they perform dangerous rituals to awaken these creatures from the crypts of her temples. Venomous mummies delight in wreaking deadly vengeance against those who disrespect the goddess.

## Death to Blasphemers

In most cases, retribution is limited to people who actually undertook acts of blasphemy. However, if the priests determine that an entire community has grown heretical, they may set mummies loose against the entire populace.

## Deadly Smoke

Though fire destroys many undead, burning a venomous mummy releases a toxic smoke.
