# [Grim Jester](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/grim-jester-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 224*  

*A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers about while making jokes that mock mortality.*

## Amusing Death

When a jester on its deathbed moves an evil death god to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve as a grim jester. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.

## Grisly Humor

A grim jester's jokes are not funny to their victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke might be absurd or sheer braggadocio, while others might be high-flown. Grim jesters are famous for grim, bitter mockery, but such humor rarely entertains mortals.

## Randomness

Grim jesters enjoy randomness and often get their hands on wands of wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with a deck of many thingsâ€”they are quite talented in pulling cards whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.
