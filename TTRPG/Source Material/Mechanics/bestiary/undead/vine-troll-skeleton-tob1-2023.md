# [Vine Troll Skeleton](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/vine-troll-skeleton-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 330*  

*Moss and flowering vines cover the hulking skeleton.*

## Corrupted Earth Magic

Vine troll skeletons guard duskthorn dryad glades and the sacred circles of druids; others serve the vila or even moss lurker colonies as guardians. In each case, they were created by corrupted earth magic for a purpose, and that energy empowers great strength and endurance—but little in the way of wits.

## Constant Regrowth

The vines holding the skeleton together regenerate quickly. This powerful magic allows vine troll skeletons to reattach severed limbs. Just like with their living cousins, only fire or acid can destroy vine troll skeletons, rendering the living vines harmless.

## Bound to a Tree's Heart

Vine troll skeletons are direct offshoots of the main vine wrapped around a duskthorn dryad 's tree, a treant, or a weeping treant. They are created by enchanting a dead troll's heart and fusing that heart with the vines of a duskthorn dryad or with the heartwood of a tree or treant, calling on magic similar to that involved in binding a dryad to her tree. Killing the duskthorn dryad or destroying the heart at the center of the parent tree kills the skeleton bound to that heart. Because of this, vine troll skeletons are single-minded defenders of their parent tree or duskthorn dryad.
