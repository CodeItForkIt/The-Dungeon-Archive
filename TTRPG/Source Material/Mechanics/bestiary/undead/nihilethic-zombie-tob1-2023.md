# [Nihilethic Zombie](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/nihilethic-zombie-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 9*  

*Eons ago, a group of aboleth left the Material Plane to wander through distant planes—seeing them through magical scrying was not enough, so these aboleth used astral magic and bodily travel to see far beyond normal realms*.

## A Forgotten Tribe

As ages passed, memories of those who departed slowly faded from the minds of those aboleth who remained behind. Those few aboleth who did remember that long ago some of their kin had gone plane-wandering assumed that the wanderers died in distant hells or paradises.

## Changed by Planar Wandering

The plane-wanderers hadn't died. Instead, their eons-long exposure to alien realms and the space between changed them, restructuring their life force, making them into something even more nightmarish—but better able to withstand both strange hells and golden realms of eldritch delight. They returned even more corrupt and powerful than when left, and these wandering nihileths returned to the mortal world intent on spreading the influence of the Void and the utter evil they found in the vast darkness between worlds.

## Undead Servitors

Humanoids, giants, and monstrosities that succumb to the nihileth's disease transform into servitors for the twisted aboleths. Most humanoids transform into nihilethic zombies, while the larger giants and monstrosities transform into nihilethic dominators. While the creatures retain much of the general shape they had in life, these servitors have translucent and slimy skin, and are adept swimmers, able to function in water or on land in service to their nihileth masters.
