- "desc": "The geist can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material\
    \ Plane, and vice versa."
  "name": "Ethereal Sight"
- "desc": "The geist can move through other creatures and objects as if they were\
    \ difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside\
    \ an object."
  "name": "Incorporeal Movement"
- "desc": "A living creature possessed by a white-aligned geist gains immunity to\
    \ the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ conditions, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from\
    \ nonmagical attacks. While the creature is possessed, the geist can allow it\
    \ to take control of its body, but the geist can regain control at any time (no\
    \ action required)."
  "name": "Intangible Virtue"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target Hit: 17 (4d6\
    \ + 3) necrotic damage."
  "name": "Withering Touch"
- "desc": "The geist enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.\
    \ It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and\
    \ vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane."
  "name": "Etherealness"
- "desc": "One creature that the geist can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on\
    \ a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the geist; the geist then disappears,\
    \ and the target is [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ and loses control of its body. The geist now controls the body but doesn't deprive\
    \ the target of awareness. The geist can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or\
    \ other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ and [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened). It otherwise uses\
    \ the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge,\
    \ class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops\
    \ to 0 hit points, the geist ends it as a bonus action, or the geist is turned\
    \ or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
    \ spell. When the possession ends, the geist reappears in an unoccupied space\
    \ within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this geist's Possession for\
    \ 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.\
    \ The geist can instead target the corpse of a creature, effectively using its\
    \ own life force to animate the corpse as a zombie. The animated corpse uses zombie\
    \ statistics and returns to death if the geist ends the possession."
