# [Mask Wight](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/mask-wight-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 264*  

*The frame of this withered demon's corpse barely fills the ash-colored plate armor that encases it. It carries a khopesh made of violet smoke, and a horned ivory mask devoid of features is nailed to its face.*

## Children of Fiends

Long ago, a demon lord of shadow fell in love with a demon goddess of the underworld. The two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other. Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.

## Rites of Annihilation

To create these undead, the lovers stole bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich and sacrificed a million condemned souls, draining their essence into ivory masks. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years. When they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge and erase their quarry from memory and history.
