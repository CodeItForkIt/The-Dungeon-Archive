# [Gray Thirster](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/gray-thirster-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 221*  

*This dried-out body of a long dead traveler is still clad in the tattered remains of its clothes. Its skin, as dry as parchment, clings to its bones, and a hoarse moaning emanates from its dry, cracked lips.*

## Thirsting Undead

The greatest danger to people traversing badlands and deserts is thirst, and even the best prepared can find themselves without water. The lucky ones die quickly, while those less fortunate linger in sun-addled torment for days. These souls sometimes rise from the sand as gray thirsters, driven to inflict the torment they suffered upon other travelers.

## Destroy Wells and Oases

Gray thirsters destroy or foul sources of water and often lurk near such sources to ambush those seeking clean water.

## Thirsting Caravan

Though they hunt alone, in at least one case an entire caravan died of thirst and rose again as gray thirsters. Called the dust caravan, it prowls the deep desert accompanied by skin-changing gnolls, shrieking ghouls, and a mummy lord, building a strange, nomadic army.
