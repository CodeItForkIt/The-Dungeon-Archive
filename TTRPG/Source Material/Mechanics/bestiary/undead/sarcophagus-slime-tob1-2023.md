# [Sarcophagus Slime](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/sarcophagus-slime-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 316*  

*The sarcophagus opens to reveal an eerie, scintillating light. Wisps of gelid amber ectoplasm undulate outward from a quivering mass with a blackened skull at its center.*

## Vigilant Slime

Sarcophagus slimes are amorphous undead guardians placed in the tombs of the powerful to guard them and to wreak terrible vengeance on would-be defilers of the ancient crypts. The slimes seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.

## Muddled Origins

Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.

## Death to Tomb Robbers

These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.
