# [Skein Witch](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/skein-witch-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 328*  

*The androgynous humanoid appears mummified in writhing, diamond thread. Its skin is translucent, and dozens of quivering hourglasses sit suspended inside its body in place of organs.*

## Shepherd Destiny

Skein witches are curators of destiny and enforcers of what must be. They voyage across the planes, weaving the strands of fate at the behest of their goddess-creator. Although they carry out their charge without regard to petty mortal concerns, they can be persuaded to bend fate for powerful petitioners whose interests align with those of their goddess.

## Surrounded by Guardians

Despite their supernatural abilities, a skein witch's physical body is frail. Because of that, they tend to surround themselves with undead, constructs, or other brutish, soulless guardians cut free from the thread of fate.

## Fear of Cards

If a deck of many things is brought close to a skein witch, the witch emits a psychic wail and disintegrates.
