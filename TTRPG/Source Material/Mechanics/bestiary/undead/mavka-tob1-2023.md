# [Mavka](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/mavka-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 265*  

*With burnt and blackened skin, burnt twigs for hair, and clawed hands and feet that resemble burnt and twisted roots, this creature appears scorched and even frail. Pupilless red eyes gleam in its sockets with a hellish green flame.*

Mavkas are twisted dryads created by undead warlocks and vampiric experiments.

## Death Riders

Mavkas ride nightmares and are fearsome raiders, snatching victims up into the saddle, never to be seen again. They despise and trample foot soldiers as peasants unworthy of attention.

## Hag Killers

Mavkas are the mortal enemies of red hags, who call these undead horrors "greenbanes." When red hag covens discover vampires and other undead turning local dryads into mavkas, they go on a rampage, destroying all undead they encounter.

> [!note] Mavkas in Midgard
> 
> There were once three dryad sisters named Mica, Anthelia, and Saramantha. After his conquest of Morgau, the Black Prince Lucan had the dryads and their trees killed and then raised them as powerful undeadâ€”mavkas. His warlocks bonded the new undead with nightmares instead of trees to complete their corruption.
> 
> These three sisters have since spawned many more such undead fey. Some serve the Black Prince as generals or concubines, while others pursue their own ends, destroying vampires, laying waste to villages, and seeking power in the Shadow Realm.
