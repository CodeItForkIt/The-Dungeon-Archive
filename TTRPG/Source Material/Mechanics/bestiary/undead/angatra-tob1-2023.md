# [Angatra](Mechanics\bestiary\undead/angatra-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 17*  

*The withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags pulls back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust.*

In certain tribes, the breaking of local taboos invites terrible retribution from ancestral spirits, especially if the transgressor was a tribal leader or elder. The transgressor is cursed and cast out from the tribe, then it is hunted and executed.

## Bound Remains Entombed

The body is wrapped head to toe in lamba cloth to soothe the spirit and to bind it within the mortal husk, then sealed in a tomb far from traditional burial grounds so none may disturb it and its unclean spirit does not taint the blessed dead.

## Slow Ritual Cleansing

Each such body is visited every ten years as the tribe performs the famadihana ritual, replacing the lamba bindings and soothing the suffering of the ancestors. Over generations, this ritual expiates their guilt, until at last the once-accursed ancestor is admitted through the gates of the afterlife. If a spirit's descendants abandon their task, or if the sealed tomb is violated, the accursed soul becomes an angatra.

## Angry Spirit

The creature's form becomes animated by a powerful and malicious ancestor spirit, undergoing a horrible metamorphosis within its decaying cocoon. Its fingernails grow into scabrous claws, its skin becomes hard and leathery, and its withered form is imbued with unnatural speed and agility. Within days, the angatra gathers strength and tears its bindings into rags. It seeks out its descendants to share the torment and wrath it endured while its spirit lingered.
