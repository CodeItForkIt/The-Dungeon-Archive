# [Gearforged Templar](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/gearforged-templar-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 196*  

*The bronze and mithral figure advances with heavy movements. Its eye lenses glare a golden hue, and gears click when it swings its greatsword.*

## Mechanical Champion

An intricate construction of bronze, steel, copper, and mithral, the gearforged templar is an imposing sight. A humanoid spirit contained in a soulgem animates the heavy body of gears and springs. Gearforged are relatively rare, and the templar is a paragon among them.

## Tireless Defender

The gearforged templar is relentless in pursuit of its duty. More so than other gearforged, the templar becomes fixed on its charge to the exclusion of distractions and even magical coercion. Gearforged templars serve as commanders of military or guard units, bodyguards for important individuals, or personal champions for nobility.
