*A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton's eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors.*

## Spectral Constructs

Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract specters yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the specters, but it gives them physical form. The specters twist the bodies to their own use, sometimes going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living. On rare occasions, other ghostly undead choose to inhabit such constructs, using the constructs as tools to enact their will in the living world at the cost of many of their natural abilities and defenses.

## Soldiers for Vampires

Fellforged often seek out greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are favorite leaders, but mummies and darakhul also make suitable commanders.

## Grave Speech

The fellforged's voice is echoing and sepulchral, unnerving most living creatures.

> [!note] Fellforged in Midgard
> 
> Dwarves of Grisal canton create fellforged to fight against undead haunts and spirits and melt them down afterwards, destroying wraiths, ghosts, and other incorporeal undead. The fellforged are also sometimes created by the Emerald Order and other cults seeking to give their evil masters a body and a shape with which to rule.
