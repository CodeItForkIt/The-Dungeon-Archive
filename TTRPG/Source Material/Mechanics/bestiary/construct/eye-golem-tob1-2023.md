# [Eye Golem](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/eye-golem-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 216*  

*Eye-like sigils dot the smooth, marble skin of this statue. One of the eye sigils opens, and a beam of brilliant light shines out.*

## Covered in Arcana

Eye golems stand at least ten feet tall, and their magically durable hide is covered with real eyes as well as arcane sigils that resemble eyes.

## Blinds Victims

An eye golem rarely kills its victims, choosing to steal its victims' eyes instead. The victims are left blinded, wandering, and tormented, seeing only visions of the eye golem flashing through their memories. This drives some mad, while others instead choose to serve the golem, becoming devoted to the one who still holds sight.

## All Eyes Open

When killed, an eye golem does not simply fall down dead. All of its eyes open at once, and a blinding burst of light shines from the body. When the light stops, hundreds of perfectly preserved eyeballs remain where its body fell, still warm, fresh, and without scars or damage. Detectable only by those trained in the arcane arts, each eye emits a barely perceptible beam of light, connecting it to its owner. The creature that holds the golem's central eye after it is slain can use the eye to restore stolen eyes to their victims.
