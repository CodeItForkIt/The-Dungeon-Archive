# [Idolic Deity](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/idolic-deity-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 239*  

*This small demonic idol emits a palpable malice.*

## Relics of Dark Gods

Idolic deities are found in ancient temples and deserted tombs. They are relics of an elder age and all that remain of the favored children of a deceiving dark godâ€”mighty lordlings like Akoman the Evil Thought, Nanghant the Discontented, and Sarvar the Oppressor. Sent to consume the souls of those worshiping gods of light, these beings of shadow and sand labor slowly through corruption of the soul rather than outright war.

## Imprisoned Corruption

The first idolic deities were created when corrupted ancient tribes and their priests began worshiping idols as gods, forsaking their masters' purposes to revel in their pride and vanity. Their deities struck them down for their treachery and imprisoned their corrupted souls in the idols they worshiped.
