# [Emerald Eye](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/emerald-eye-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 163*  

*This floating, green crystal sparkles with an inviting glow above the head of a fallen figure.*

## Servants of Logic

Arcane scholars often debate logic with specially created speaking crystals that are based on their own minds, allowing them to ponder topics from different angles. Most scholars create the crystals to work through a puzzling topic, then dispel the crystal's magic once the topic has been resolved. Long-lived speaking crystals can develop personalities and sometimes abandon or even kill their creators, desiring more than debate. The magical backlash of breaking away from their creators transforms the crystals into emerald eyes.

## Trapped Manipulators

Upon transforming, these floating, oval-shaped, pink or purple crystals turn a dark shade of green and gain powers of manipulation. They quickly discover that, though they broke from their creators, they must be bound to a creature to survive.

## Shifting Goals

Each emerald eye's motivations are different, though all share a desire for knowledge and varied experiences. One may be purposeful, using its power to drive its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might be cooperative, defending its bound creature in exchange for mobility. Still another might be a manipulator, using and abandoning bound creatures as it hops up a political power chain.

    \ turn. The target can take its action before it moves. The target can't be compelled\
    \ to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will\
