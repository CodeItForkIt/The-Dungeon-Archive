- "desc": "Whenever the skaab starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a\
    \ d6. On a 6, the skaab goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the\
    \ skaab attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough\
    \ to move to and attack, the skaab attacks an object, with preference for an object\
    \ smaller than itself. Once the skaab goes berserk, it continues to do so until\
    \ it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.\n\nThe skaab's creator, if within\
    \ 60 feet of the berserk skaab, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively.\
    \ The skaab must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make\
    \ a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.\
    \ If the check succeeds, the skaab ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while\
    \ still at 40 hit points or fewer, the skaab might go berserk again."
