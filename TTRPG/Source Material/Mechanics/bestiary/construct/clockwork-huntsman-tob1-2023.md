## Slave Hunters

These metal huntsmen were once the province of corrupt aristocrats, running down escaped slaves and tracking prey in hunting expeditions. Their masters may vary, but the clockwork huntsmen still perform when called upon. In some places, they operate only on the command of the secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted for questioning. Huntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their quarry in a group of two or three. Because they are unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them long without magical assistance.

## Despised Machines

Clockwork huntsmen stand nearly six feet tall and weigh 400 pounds. They are painted matte black with mithral trim and occasionally outfitted with armor or a black steel blade for added intimidation. Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and commanders shun them.

## Obedient to Orders

Bound with specific instructions, clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, alert to their surroundings. Clockwork huntsmen are unrelenting and single-minded in their missions, focusing on particular targets—priests, spellcasters, or heavily armored intruders, as directed. Oblivious to injury, clockwork huntsmen attack until destroyed or ordered to stand down.
