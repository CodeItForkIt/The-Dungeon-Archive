## Cleaning Constructs

Created by gnomish tinkerers, xanka are constructs whose purpose is cleaning up their masters' messy workshops. Most xanka are built from copper, brass, or bronze, but gold, silver, and platinum varieties have been seen in the houses of nobles and rich merchants. Xanka are not built for fighting—their instinct tells them to skitter for cover when danger threatens—but they defend themselves when cornered.

## Follow Commands

These constructs understand and obey simple commands that relate to the removal of garbage. They can communicate with each other through whirs, clicks, and flashing lights, but those who have studied this communication find it is rarely more than a relaying of commands from the master between xanka to more efficiently carry out the master's wishes.

## Absorb Matter

When a xanka touches material to its globular body, it absorbs that material into itself, quickly breaking the material down into magical energy. They can use this energy to power themselves for further tasks or to protect themselves from danger by expelling the energy in a burst. Tinkerers use xanka to keep their homes and cities clear of refuse.
