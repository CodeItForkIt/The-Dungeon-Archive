# [Feyward Tree](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/feyward-tree-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 186*  

*Dark, bark-like rust encrusts the trunk of this metal tree, and its dull metallic leaves rustle with the sound of sharp metal.*

## Cold Iron Trees

These ferrous constructs are cold-forged in a process taking several years, as bits of rust and other oxidation are cultivated one layer at a time into bark and branches. In this way, the artificers create massive, twisted trunks resembling real, gnarled trees. Green-tinged leaves of beaten cold iron are welded in place by the master craftsmen, and trained warmages bring the construct to life through intense magical rituals rumored to take a full turn of seasons.

## Fey Destroyers

The feyward tree unswervingly obeys the commands of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected faerie rings, or possible elf encampments. Many are released deep in elvish woods with orders to attack any fey on sight. These trees are rarely, if ever, heard from again. Whether they leave a bloody trail of flayed elves in their wake or some fey counter-measure neutralizes them is unknown.

## Growing Numbers

Each year, the feywardens order the construction and release of a handful of feyward trees, trusting in the destructive nature of the constructs. The feywardens leave nothing to chance, flooding fey forests with the constructs over decades.
