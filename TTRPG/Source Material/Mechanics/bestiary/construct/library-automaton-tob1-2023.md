# [Library Automaton](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/library-automaton-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 252*  

*The humming of servos, ticking of gears, and petite discharges of steam precede the library's diminutive custodian.*

Library automatons are small constructs created to fulfill organizational responsibilities of huge libraries.

## Eyes of the Past

Each automaton includes a single humanoid eyeball mounted at the end of an articulated appendage. These eyes are typically donations from the library's ailing scholars, allow them to continue serving the repositories of knowledge that were their life's work.

## Telekinetic

The automatons can move and manipulate written materials telekinetically, and they can store such works in an extradimensional space within their bodies. The library automaton tirelessly pores through tomes, translates ancient texts, catalogs the institution's volumes, fetches texts for visitors, and occasionally rids the vast halls of uninvited pests.

## Scholarly Familiars

Many spellcasters have discovered library automatons make particularly effective caretakers for their spellbooks and scrolls while on adventure.

> [!note] Library Automaton Familiars
> 
> The library automaton's scholarly nature leads some of them to serve spellcasters and learn more of the world. Such automatons have the following trait.
> 
> **Familiar.** The library automaton can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the automaton senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the automaton is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion has resistance to psychic damage. At any time and for any reason, the automaton can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
