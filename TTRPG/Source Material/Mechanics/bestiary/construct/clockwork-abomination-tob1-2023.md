# [Clockwork Abomination](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/clockwork-abomination-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 59*  

*The pile of debris and scrap on the ground suddenly rises, revealing a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many orange-yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of expression or intent.*

## Bound Devils

Clockwork abominations result from ill-considered attempts to bind lesser devils into clockwork or steam-driven constructs. The disciplines of devil-binding and engineering seemingly do not mix well, and the results are typically disastrous. Every now and then, however, something goes right, and a clockwork abomination is created.

## Junk Collectors

Clockwork abominations are canny enough to collect bits of old wagons, tools, or machinery as camouflage. Motionless among such debris and with a deceptively long reach due to pistons in their limbs, they can surprise foes with a sudden attack.

## Sadistic Machines

Malevolent in the extreme, these fiendish automatons are frustrated by the limits of their forms, and they delight in inflicting suffering on others. Constantly seeking to break free of their creators' control, the most they can be entrusted to do is serve as a guardian or to attack something.
