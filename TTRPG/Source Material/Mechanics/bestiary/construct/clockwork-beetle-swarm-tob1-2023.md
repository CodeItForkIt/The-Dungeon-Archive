# [Clockwork Beetle Swarm](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/clockwork-beetle-swarm-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 60*  

*Gleaming metal and whirring gears make up the form of this elaborate mechanical insect the size of a housecat.*

## Bejeweled Familiars

Forged by talented jewelers and sold to gear-mages and aristocrats, clockwork beetles are highly prized as familiars. Although normally created in the form of metal beetles, their appearance can vary greatly. Some resemble incandescent ladybugs while others have razor-sharp horns reminiscent of deadly stag beetles. Some are fashioned as darkling beetles with prehensile antennae, and even weevil-like designs have been spotted. In the southern deserts, scarab beetle patterns are particularly prized.

## Hidden Timers

The most talented gear-mages occasionally design a clockwork beetle with a hidden countdown clock that silently ticks down over years or even decades. When the counter expires, it triggers a mechanical metamorphosis, causing the beetle to rapidly transform into a completely different clockwork creatureâ€”a wondrous surprise known only to the original designer.

## Freed But Foolish

Clockwork beetle swarms form when several of the creatures break free of their creators and bond together in a noisy mass of clattering, mechanical parts. Severed from the bonds of their creators, the swarm lacks the telepathy of singular clockwork beetles and has a reduced mental capacity.
