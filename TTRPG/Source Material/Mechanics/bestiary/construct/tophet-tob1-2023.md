# [Tophet](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/tophet-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 364*  

*An enormous bronze and iron statue filled with fire towers above the ring of chanting, frenzied worshipers.*

Worshipers of fire gods use tophets to incinerate sacrifices in their flaming maws. A tophet has a large opening in the front where the flames can be seen; sometimes this is an enormous mouth, and at other times it is a large hole in the tophet's belly. Horns and expressions of anger or wideâ€‘mouthed laughter are common.

## Eager for Sacrifices

Among fire cultists, it's widely known that when a tophet's hands are raised above its mouth, it is demanding a sacrifice to roll down its palms and into its fiery maw.

## Heed Musical Commands

Flutes and drums can be used to control the actions of a tophet during sacrifices. They have the fortunate side effect of drowning out the cries and screams of living sacrifices.

## Magical Fires

The fires within a tophet's bronze body are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don't require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food, cloth, and living creatures to keep them under control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.
