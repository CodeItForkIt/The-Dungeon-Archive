# [Clockwork Myrmidon](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/clockwork-myrmidon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 63*  

*This hulking brass and iron creature resembles a giant suit of plate armor. A constant growl issues from its midsection. Its squat head wears an angry expression, and it moves with powerful, determined grace*.

## Elite Machines

Clockwork myrmidons are heavily armored at their joints and at most vital parts. They are much too valuable to undertake patrols or menial labor, and are unleashed only for dangerous situations that clockwork watchmen cannot handle.

## Single Targets

A clockwork myrmidon defends itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon is unrelenting and single-minded. It attacks one particular target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated. Unless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.

## Alchemical Tricks

A clockwork myrmidon is always outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.
