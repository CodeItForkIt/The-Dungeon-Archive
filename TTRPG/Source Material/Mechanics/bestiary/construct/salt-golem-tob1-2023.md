# [Salt Golem](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/salt-golem-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 218*  

*A crudely sculpted, roughly humanoid crystalline form shuffles about on wide, stump-like feet. Tiny salt crystals fall from its body in a glittering cloud with every step.*

## Coastal Druids

These unnatural creatures are created by druids and others living in coastal or desert regions, or by those who seek to wage war with creatures susceptible to the warding powers of salt. Stories tell of a druid who built a squad of nine salt golems to combat a rampaging zmey. The salt warriors waged a long hunt and eventually killed the powerful dragon in its lair while the creator druid and her wizard companion reaped the spoils of its hoard.

## Crystalline and Silent

A salt golem has a crudely formed humanoid body made of crystalline salts. It wears no clothing or armor and carries no weapons or other possessions. It cannot speakâ€”the only sound it makes is the susurrus of sliding sand as it moves. A salt golem is incapable of strategy or tactics. It mindlessly fights until it destroys its opponents or until ordered to stop by its creator.

## Valuable Remains

A salt golem stands about eight feet tall and weighs around 1,000 pounds. A salt golem's body is formed from a composite of 1,000 pounds of rare salts and minerals worth at least 2,500 gp.
