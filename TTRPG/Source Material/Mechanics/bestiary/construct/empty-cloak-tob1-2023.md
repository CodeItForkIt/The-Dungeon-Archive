# [Empty Cloak](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/empty-cloak-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 164*  

*This dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood.*

## Silent Motion

A billowing empty cloak glides through the air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master. Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly out of step with the frame bearing it.

## Guards

Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians, empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor or other constructs like monolith footmen, and made to look like a display piece.

## Shadow Servants

Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an empty cloak as their own clothing, using it to cover a hasty retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.
