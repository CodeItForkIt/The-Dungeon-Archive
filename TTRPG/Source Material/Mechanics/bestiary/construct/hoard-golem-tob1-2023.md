# [Hoard Golem](Mechanics\bestiary\construct/hoard-golem-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 217*  

*A pile of gold, jewelry, and weapons rises on its own like a tidal wave of riches, with a cold and determined face.*

## Dragon Fears Made Real

Hoard golems were born from the paranoia of dragons. Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.

## Patient Homebodies

As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner's den.

## Silent and Wealthy

Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 pounds. A hoard golem's body is composed of items—copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor, weapons, and magical items—worth at least 5,000 gp

    \ On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't lose an object. Each\
    \ object the golem steals must weigh no more than 20 pounds and not be wrapped\
    \ around or firmly attached to a creature. For example, the golem could steal\
    \ a belt pouch full of coins or a creature's jewel-encrusted dagger, but it can't\
    \ steal a creature's shirt or armor. The hoard golem steals objects of high value\
    \ over those of minimal value. The stolen object becomes part of the golem's body\
    \ and can't be retrieved until the golem dies."
