# [Shadow Beast](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/shadow-beast-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 324*  

*A mass of shadows and cloudstuff, never touching the ground, extends clawed hands as it reveals a glint of jagged teeth.*

## Called from the Void

Shadow beasts are thought to be the result of shadow fey dabbling in the magic of the Void, transforming the shadow fey into something wholly different. Almost shapeless and largely incorporeal, through an act of will they can form rough semblances of their old bodies when needed.

## Hate the Past

The motivations of these creatures are inscrutable. They despise light and anything that reminds them of light or of their former existence. Beyond that, little is understood about them.

## Cryptic Messages

Shadow beasts are seldom found in groups, but when they are, they seem to have no difficulty or reluctance about operating and fighting together. They have been known to deliver cryptic and threatening messages, but speaking is difficult for them. At times, they perform arcane rituals with the aid of evil humanoids and the use of dark materials. In these rituals, they sacrifice magical energies and life blood as well as the tears of innocents and the souls of the damned.
