# [Mirror Hag](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/mirror-hag-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 227*  

*This hunchbacked crone's sallow skin is covered with growths and lesions.*

## Hideous Hex

Until a creature can see past the hag's deformities, she curses it with the pain of a disfigured life. Some mirror hags do this for the betterment of all, but most do it because causing pain amuses them.

## Warped Features

Mirror hags are hunchbacked, with growths and lesions covering their skin. Their joints misalign, and the extremities of their bones press against their skin. However, it is their faces that inspire legends: the blackest moles sprouting long white hairs, noses resembling half-eaten carrots, and eyes mismatched in size, color, and alignment. If a creature recoils from a mirror hag's looks, she bestows her reconfiguring curse on it.

## Mirror Covens

Mirror hags can form a coven with two other hags. Generally, mirror hags only form covens with other mirror hags, but from time to time a mirror hag will join a coven of witches or green hags.
