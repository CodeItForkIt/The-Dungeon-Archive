# [Vila](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/vila-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 386*  

*A woman with hair the color of spring grass, skin like polished wood, and eyes as gray as a storm rides through the forest on the back of a large deer.*

## Dryad Cousins

The vila are kin to the dryads, and like their cousins, they serve as protectors of the deepest forests.

## Demand Oaths

Where dryads beguile to accomplish their goals, the vila coerce and threaten. They demand oaths from interlopers and enforce the oaths fiercely. Vila delight in testing the virtue of travelers and in tormenting the uncharitable and cruel with misfortune.

## Hunt with a Pack

Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or deer. In combat, they sometimes ride fleet-footed deer, the better to harry opponents or escape if events turn against them.
