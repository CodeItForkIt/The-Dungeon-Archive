# [Duskthorn Dryad](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/duskthorn-dryad-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 150*  

*This striking woman with obvious fey features and skin the color of slate sits in the shade of an ancient, vine-wrapped tree. Clothed in vines and leaves, she is almost indistinguishable from the tree.*

## Creeper Vine Spirits

Duskthorn dryads are spirits tied to thorn-bearing creeper vines. They seek out dead trees as homes for their vines. They can travel through trees to escape their foes but must stay near their vines.

## Grove Guardians

Duskthorn dryads use their vines and the plants in their glades to defend themselves. They often call on the aid of forest animals and children of the briar. Occasionally, a circle of duskthorn dryads work together to call on the aid of an enormously strong vine troll skeleton to protect their grove.

> [!note] Duskthorn Dryads in Midgard
> 
> These dryads are commonly found near the ruins of Thorn, in the Arbonesse Forest, and in the Shadow Realms. They are close friends to the darker fey and are thought by some to be created from ordinary dryads drawn into the corruption of the Shadow Realm. Certainly, their mastery of the shadowy Umbral language shows their close ties to this darker world.
