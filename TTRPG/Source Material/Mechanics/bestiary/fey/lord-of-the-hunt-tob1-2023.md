# [Lord of the Hunt](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/lord-of-the-hunt-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 174*  

*Astride a midnight horse sits a shirtless elven huntsman. His broad chest is thickly muscled and sports tattooed knot work. Great stag antlers crest the huntsman's head, curving above his rich brown hair. The pale green glow that shines from his eyes obscures the elf 's strong features, and a massive spear twined with glowing green vines drives forward in his clenched fist*.

The baying of shadow hounds, the thundering of hoof beats, and a brassy horn note; the Wild Hunt is coming, and pity its quarry. The Lord of the Hunt is an enigma among the fey nobles. His true identity beyond title and position as master of the Wild Hunt is unknown, but he has some connection to the Black Prince of the shadow fey—while also answering to elvish druids and consorting with powerful hags and dryads.

## The Wild Hunt

The Lord's court is the Wild Hunt itself, a group of huntsmen, revelers, intelligent hounds, and poor souls they sweep up in their frenzy. His home, if he has any permanent dwelling, is as mysterious as his true identity. He and his Hunt constantly move between the Plane of Shadow and the most ancient forests.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Lord of the Hunt's Lair

If the Lord of the Hunt has any permanent lair, it is unknown to all but his closest confidants. While the Wild Hunt is a thing of beautiful and deadly grace on the move, the Lord's encampment becomes his lair when the Hunt settles for any length of time. Tents and pavilions house the Lord and his Hunt, and great, roaring fires roast the day's kills. The hours pass with revelry, feasting, physical contests, and strong drink.
