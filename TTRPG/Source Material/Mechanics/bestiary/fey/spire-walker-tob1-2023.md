# [Spire Walker](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/spire-walker-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 347*  

*This miniscule creature kicks up a ghostly, sparkling fire when it jostles and jigs. Lightning sparks fly between it and its perch.*

## Storm Dancers

When storm clouds gather over cities, harbors, and twisted badlands, electrical energy fills the air. During these times, miniscule fey dance on church steeples, desolate peaks, and ships' masts. Also called corposanti by scholars, spire walkers are nature spirits that delight in grandiose displays of thunderbolts. They can be found frolicking in a thunderstorm or keeping company with blue dragons or storm giants—though these larger creatures often chase them off for being a nuisance.

## Small and Metallic

Spire walkers stand no more than a foot tall, with dusky blue-gray skin and shocks of silvery, slate, or pale blue hair. Spire walkers prefer clothing in metallic hues with many buttons, and they always carry a handful of tiny copper darts that they hurl at each other during their incomprehensible games. When excited, they emit a sparking glow from the tips of their noses, eyebrows, ears, and pointy shoes. They play rough-and-tumble games among themselves and enjoy pranking bystanders with frightening but mostly harmless electric shocks. If a spire walker perishes during the fun, the others pause just long enough to say "awww, we'll miss you" and go through their comrade's pockets before continuing with the game.

## Love Copper and Amber

Spire walkers like gold but they love copper. They prefer it over all other metals, and they keep the copper pieces in their pockets brilliantly polished. They also value amber gems. Among a group of spire walkers, the leader is not the cleverest or most ruthless, but the one displaying the most ostentatious amber jewel.
