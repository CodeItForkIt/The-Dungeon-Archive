# [Sand Hag](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/sand-hag-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 229*  

*This withered crone glares malevolently, her face framed by lank, gray hair. Her malicious grin is filled with shark teeth and drool trickles from her lips.*

## Hatred of Beauty

Dressed in tattered robes and skeletally thin, sand hags are terrifying crones that haunt desert ruins and forgotten oases. Their hatred for things of beauty and peace is terrible to behold. A sand hag uses her illusions and mimicry to lure travelers into an ambush.

## False Oasis

These hags delight in tricking a caravan into an illusory oasis, killing all the riding animals and pack animals so the travelers can't flee, and then terrifying and slaughtering them one by one.

## Drain Bodies

For the slaughter of animals or humanoids, a sand hag prefers to rely on her claws, which drain the moisture from her victims. They leave the mummified remnants in postures of life—tied to a saddle or atop a guard tower—to terrify others.
