# [Lorelei](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/lorelei-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 258*  

*Lounging on a large river rock, this breathtaking fey calls plaintively to travelers.*

## Death to Men

A people born from an ancient oath to the River King, the loreleis' cruelty stems from whatever happened to their people long ago that brought about their transformation into loreleis. Now, these callous river sirens compete with one another in manipulating and destroying male travelers, using their deadly kisses to great effect.

## Beautiful Humanoids

Although legends describe the lorelei as golden-haired and fair-skinned, they come in all varieties, taking on the form of their most frequent prey. While most resemble sensual humans, a lorelei's form can include elf, dwarf, and, in some recorded cases, even orc or hobgoblin.

## Ignore Women

Women travelers are vexing for the lorelei. While the siren's powers affect women as readily as men, the lorelei lacks the urge to destroy them. Women traveling alone or in all-female groups may pass through a lorelei's territory safely, and they might even make peaceful contact.
