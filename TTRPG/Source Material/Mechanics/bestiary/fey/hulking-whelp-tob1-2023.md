# [Hulking Whelp](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/hulking-whelp-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 236*  

*This gray-skinned dog-like creature seems pathetically eager to please but fantastically skittish, its ears alerting at every nearby sound, and its large oval eyes following anything that passes by.*

## Emotional Giant

A hulking whelp is a tightly wound ball of emotion, extremely defensive of its personal space and terrified of the world around it. When it feels its personal space is violated, or its fragile concentration is broken, the small, quivery fey grows into a muscled beast of giant proportions.

## Calm Friend

When its emotions are under control, a hulking whelp is friendly and even helpful, although this has more to do with its guilt over past actions than a true desire to help others. In its calm form, a hulking whelp is just over three feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 50 pounds. Unleashed, it is 20 feet tall and 4,000 pounds.

    \ If the check succeeds, the hulking whelp transforms back into its whelp form\
