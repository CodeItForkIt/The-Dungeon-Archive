# [Redcap](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/redcap-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 306*  

*This grizzled, weather-beaten creature looks like a sour old man, complete with scraggly beard. It carries a great pike and wears a blood-soaked hat and heavy boots shod with iron. It grins with massive yellow teeth*.

## Blood-Soaked Caps

Redcaps are exceedingly dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name define their very existenceâ€”these caps must constantly be revived with fresh blood.

## Compelled to Kill

Redcaps aren't cruel and murderous by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.

## Bandits and Mercenaries

Most long-lived redcaps are drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through constant banditry.
