# [Ice Maiden](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/ice-maiden-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 238*  

*This alluring beauty has flesh and hair as white as snow and eyes as blue as glacial ice.*

## Born of the Ice

Ice maidens are the daughters of powerful creatures of the cold, such as the Snow Queen, frost giants, and thursir. A few result from pleas by pregnant women lost in the snows, desperate to save their children. Fraughashar often raise these infants as ice maidens.

## Solitary Lives

Most ice maidens live solitary existences save for a servant or two under their thrall. They're lonely creatures, desperate for love but condemned to know companionship only through their magical kiss. If genuine love ever fills an ice maiden's heart, she melts into nothingness.

## Killing Dilemma

An ice maiden's hunger for affection and contact leads her to harm those she approaches, which only drives her harder to seek warmth and love. An ice maiden can become a dryad or even a humanoid if she keeps a lover's heart warm for a full year.
