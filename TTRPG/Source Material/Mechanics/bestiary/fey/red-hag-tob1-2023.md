# [Red Hag](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/red-hag-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 228*  

*The red-skinned woman steps forward, sunlight glinting in her raven hair as red magic swirls around her.*

An elder race—older than the elves, and as old as the dragons, they claim—red hags are the most cunning and longest-lived of the hags, with a lifespan of more than a thousand years.

## Beautiful and Strong

Unlike many of their hag kin, red hags are not horrid to look upon, and most are considered comely in their own right. Few know anything about them, and the red hags do little to enlighten scholars, preferring seclusion.

## Tied to Nature

Red hags have a deep connection with all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.

## Blood Magic

Because of their connection to nature, red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic blood magic—both to slake their craving for humanoid blood, but also as a means to venerate goddesses of dark magic. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy with the most powerful spellcasters at the top.

> [!note] Red Hags in Midgard
> 
> Red hags are more sociable among their own kind than other hags are, and they sometimes live in small communities in remote areas. In ancient times, they settled together in larger clusters and ruled small cities of mixed populations—especially in Old Verrayne. Their current leader is Blood Mother Margase, an ancient druid.
> 
> Their greatest city, Talitheos, an island metropolis of vast wealth and magical knowledge, sunk during the cataclysm, and the hags have been seeking its ruins ever since.
