*These batwinged fey sport horns, scales, and other minor draconic features.*

## Dragon Sprites

Chernomoi (which means "lair sprite" in Draconic) often reside discreetly in a dragon lair or dragonborn household, cleaning and tidying up at night and only occasionally keeping a small trinket or shiny gemstone as compensation. They appear as tiny, winged humanoids, dressed in metallic armor made of small coins and semi-precious stones.

## Lair Alarms

Chernomoi are terrified of wyverns and never lair anywhere near them. Otherwise, they are very protective of their draconic masters and raise an alarm if an intruder is undetected. They fight with their tiny blades if cornered, though they always flee from danger as a first optionâ€”usually straight to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.

> [!note] Chernomoi in Midgard
> 
> Dragons of the Mharoti Empire consider chernomoi cute guardian pets and treat them roughly the way humans treat a parrot or other pet bird. In some cases, chernomoi serve elder dragons as familiars and messengers, dressed in dazzling armor made of gemstones. Chernomoi familiars and messengers are as much valued companions as they are a visible sign of their master's wealth and power.
