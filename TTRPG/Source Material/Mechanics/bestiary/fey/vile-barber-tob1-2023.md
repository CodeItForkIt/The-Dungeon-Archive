# [Vile Barber](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/vile-barber-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 387*  

*A pale, scrawny fellow clad in a black leather apron and slender ebon gloves grins from the shadows. A maw of needle-sharp teeth and a wicked straight razor at his side are clear warnings that his enemies should hasten their footsteps.*

Vile barbers are sadistic fey who move through the shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey are found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.

## Fey Punishers

Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies (see Tome of Beasts), and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. They scar those who have spoken ill of the fey, and they slowly bleed out those who have harmed or murdered the fey. Some of these deaths are made quite public to reinforce the power of the barber's lord.

## Slippery Fighters

Vile barbers can slip through shadows, catching foes off guard or escaping a foe that has the upper hand. They delight in close combat and in inflicting wounds that terrify onlookers.

## Assassins and Envoys

Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the vile barbers is scant; most adventurers who meet them don't live to share the findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean.
