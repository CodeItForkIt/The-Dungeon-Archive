## Dark Satyrs

The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious fauns who have abandoned nature worship and instead venerate ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.

## Battle Song and Laughter

Selangs relish battle, pain, and torture. They find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat. Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old gods, their manic speech and alien logic can sometimes be hard to follow. They are most comfortable with the slithering tones of Void Speech.

## Blasphemous Music

Selang cults and settlements are often found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs use their magic and poison against their foes.
