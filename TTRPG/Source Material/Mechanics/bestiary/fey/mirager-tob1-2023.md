*Diaphanous veils cover a graceful woman, flowing like water across her as she dances through the dust.*

## Humanoid Sand

Cursed with crumbling, sandy bodies by a long-since-forgotten fey lord, miragers rely on blood and moisture from mortal creatures to replenish and sustain their forms. With such sustenance hard to acquire in their desert homes, miragers don't gather in groups and can be particularly vicious when starved. Some miragers might make bargains or forge friendships with mortal creatures, but the mirager's everpresent need for blood and moisture means such alliances rarely survive the dry season.

## Enticing Illusion

A mirager can take on the guise of a lovely man or woman with luminous eyes, delicate features, and seductive garments. Whatever its form, a mirager dresses in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.

    \ hold up to physical inspection. For example, the mirager could appear to have\
