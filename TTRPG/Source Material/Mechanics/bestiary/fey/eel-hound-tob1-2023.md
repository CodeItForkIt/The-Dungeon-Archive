# [Eel Hound](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/eel-hound-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 155*  

*The grotesque beast has the muscular tail, bulbous head, and rubbery, slime-covered flesh of an eel. Its torso and webbed paws resemble those of a misshapen canine, while needle-sharp teeth fill its menacing jaws.*

## Hounds of the River Fey

Ferocious aquatic fey, these amphibious menaces often serve lake trolls, lorelei, green hags, and other watery fey and giants. Predatory beasts as dangerous on land as they are in the water, the have a capricious cruelty. Few creatures beyond the fey appreciate eel hounds' lithe power and cruel grace, instead noting only their grotesque form and unnerving savagery.

## Slippery Ambushers

Eel hounds are ambush predators, hiding among the muck and algae of riverbanks, bursting out as a pack. Possessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by vomiting their slippery spittle where land animals come to drink or along game trails. Then they surge from the water to snatch the off-balance prey. They surround targets, latching on with their powerful jaws, and then drag non-aquatic prey into the depths to drown or force aquatic prey onto land to suffocate.

## Fey Water Hounds

Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in other tongues.
