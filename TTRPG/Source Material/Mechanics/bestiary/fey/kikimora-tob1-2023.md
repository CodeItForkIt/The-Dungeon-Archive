# [Kikimora](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/kikimora-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 243*  

*This strange-looking humanoid combines the features of an old crone and some manner of bird. A shawl covers her head but cannot contain her prominent beak and clawed hands. Her skirt reveals bird-like feet*.

## Filthy Illusions

Kikimoras are devious house spirits who torment those in their domain. They delight in harassing homeowners with their illusions, making a house look much filthier than it actually is. Their favored illusions include mold, filth, and scuttling vermin. They love secretly breaking things and making destruction seem like an accident. They then convince the house's residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.

## Brownie Hunters

Kikimoras hate brownies (see*Tome of Beasts 3*). While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras bring pain and frustration on their housemates instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along. Some brownies seek out kikimora-infested homes with the intention of evicting them.

## Pest Control

If homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or cannot rid themselves of its devious presence), the kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats to torment the inhabitants. Inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora often believe it is haunted.

    \ touch the symbol and be transported to an extradimensional space just large\
    \ enough to hold the kikimora and up to 50 pounds of nonmagical objects. Only\
    \ the kikimora can enter this space, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing\

    \ on the symbol and can exit the space as an action, appearing in an unoccupied\
