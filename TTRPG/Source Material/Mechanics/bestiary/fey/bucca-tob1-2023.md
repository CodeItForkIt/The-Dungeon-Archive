*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 44*  

*These tiny, obsidian-skinned, bat-winged fey have a hungry look. Leering with razor-sharp fangs bared, they licking their leathery faces with their forked, purple tongues.*

## Hidden in Crevices

Buccas are tiny, underground faeries who are also known as "snatchers," because they love to steal from miners and hoard precious minerals and gems in tiny, trap‑filled crevices. Their small size makes them easy to overlook.

## Treasure Finders

Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.

## Bat Friends

Buccas often train bats as mounts, messengers, and guard animals. On occasion, they sell trained bats to goblins and kobolds.
