# [Queen of Witches](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/queen-of-witches-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 180*  

*This statuesque woman towers over any tall man and most ogres. Her hair falls in a cascade of curls and looks as if it is spun from copper. Her eyes are the color of moss beds, with no iris or pupil. A billowy robe of forest green enshrouds her body, and she grasps a great ring of etched silver in one massive fist*.

Nicnevin, the Queen of Witches, is the Mountain Ogress, Lady of Copper and Crystal, and the Moon Weaver. She is not what one usually imagines in a fey lady, but she has an imposing figure of mass and power. Her stature speaks to great physical strength and the stalwart defiance of the mountain itself, but her true power is in her command of magic.

## Pact Patron

The Queen of Witches is one of the foremost patrons of those who seek power through a pact. Many hag covens offer her loyalty and tribute. She rules from beneath her mountain, attended by a court of fey witches, hags, and mortal supplicants. Her favor is highly sought after, and it is said that a single hair from her coppery head contains all the power a mortal might ever desire.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Queen of Witches's Lair

The Queen of Witches makes her lair in a cavern deep beneath a windswept, rocky mountain. Near the mountain's peak is an enormous quartz crystal that grows down to the lair. This crystal channels the light of the moon into the Queen's home when she doesn't emerge into the night sky. Her hags and attendant witches perform powerful rites in this magic-saturated sanctum.

    \ thunder damage, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, and immunity\
    \ to poison and psychic damage. The wall remains until the Queen uses this lair\
    \ action again, until she dismisses it as a bonus action, or until she dies. \
    \ \n- Disrupt Spellcasting. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each\
    \ creature, other than fey, that casts a spell while within 60 feet of the Queen\

    \ the spell slot.  \n- Moonlight Blast. A searing flare of moonlight bursts\
    \ from a point the Queen can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within\
    \ 15 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking\
    \ 13 (3d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
