# [Nichny](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/nichny-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 284*  

*These ancient creatures resemble nothing so much as black cats dressed in sumptuous, archaic, clothing.*

## Xenophobic

The nichny are highly xenophobic and gleefully carnivorous fey who dwell in deep, primeval forests.

## True and False Prophets

Nichny have oracular powers, but they rarely share their prophecies with outsiders. Their prophecies are always delivered in triples, and legend holds that two inevitably prove true and one proves false.

## Answer Three Questions

One final legend claims that if a nichny can be bound with gold or orichalcum chains, it must answer three questions. As with their prophecies, two answers will be true and one will be a lie. All three questions must be posed before any will be answered. When the third answer is given, the nichny and the chains disappear.

> [!note] Nichny in Midgard
> 
> Known as dolia ("fate speakers") in Old Elvish, elven legend says the nichny welcomed the first elves to Midgard. They also gifted the first Emperor of the Elves with three prophecies: humans would cause a great schism and estrangement among the elves, forcing them to flee Midgard; an elfmarked child would be the doom of all elvenkind; and a third prophecy so horrific that the elves erased it with powerful magic.
