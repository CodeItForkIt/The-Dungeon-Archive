# [Snow Queen](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/snow-queen-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 184*  

*This severe elf has pale, almost white skin and tightly braided blond hair. Her gown is exquisite, fashioned of luminous blue fabric that catches light and shines from within. Lacy ice crystals accent the gown, and a snow-white mantle cascades from her shoulders. Icicles radiate in a crownlike halo behind her head, drifting gracefully through the air*.

Her Crystalline Majesty, Morrinn, is the cold-hearted Snow Queen, Daughter of Boreas. The Snow Queen rules a northern kingdom in the remote, frozen reaches of the world. Perpetually shrouded in snow and ice, her domain is inhospitable to outsiders. She rules from a castle of delicate spires carved entirely out of ice. The dwelling catches and reflects even the faintest glimmer of light, shining like a beacon and enticing travelers to risk the dangerous winter realm.

## Queen of Giants

The Snow Queen is proud and cruel to any who cross her. Her daughters, the ice maidens, roam her kingdom with ease. Travelers who can't give a good reason to be moving through the Queen's territory meet a quick end in the maidens' chilly embrace. The Snow Queen commands the loyalty of winter-born tribes of fraughashar, ogres, frost giants, thursir giants, and trollkin. She is said to have mocked both Thor and Loki and often leads their priests astray into winter storms.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Snow Queen's Lair

The Snow Queen's lair is a castle made of ice. Sunlight and moonlight flash through the delicate spires and translucent walls, setting the palace agleam even in the deepest night. The castle reflects its mistress: beautiful, cold, and unforgivingly deadly.

    \ rolls against her until initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- Isolated\
    \ Blizzard. A blast of wintry weather and heavy snow falls in a 30-foot radius\
    \ centered on a point on the ground that the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet\
    \ of her. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature that enters the\
    \ area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw\
    \ or be restrained by the snow. A creature, including the restrained creature,\
    \ can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 18\
    \ Strength check. The snow melts away when the Queen uses this lair action again\
    \ or when the Queen dies.  \n- Snow Wall. A wall of dense snow erupts on a\
    \ solid surface within 120 feet of the Snow Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long,\
    \ 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears,\
    \ each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or\
    \ take 14 (4d6) cold damage and be pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing\
    \ on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall,\
    \ though the wall is filled with freezing snow. For every 1 foot a creature moves\
    \ through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. A creature that starts its\
    \ turn in the wall or enters the wall's space for the first time on a turn must\
    \ make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of the\
    \ wall has AC 5, 15 hp, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning\
    \ damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall melts when\
    \ the Queen uses this lair action again or when she dies.  "
