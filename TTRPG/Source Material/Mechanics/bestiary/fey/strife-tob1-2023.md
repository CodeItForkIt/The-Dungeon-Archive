# [Strife](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/strife-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 349*  

*The small, childlike creature with purple skin and an overly large mouth hovers in the shadows of the alleyway behind the tavern, giggling with delight as it watches fights break out.*

This strange, childlike fey feeds off the negative feelings that manifest from mortals who spread rumors and falsehoods about one another.

## False Legends

Due to its ability to remain unseen and its appearance wherever discord rises, many in the mortal world believe this fey is the physical embodiment of a feeling, a magical manifestation brought on by strong mortal emotions. Delighting in rumors and misinformation, the fey don't correct these interpretations and proudly use the mortal moniker, strife.

## Invasive Fey

Though strifes aren't physical embodiments of mortal emotions, negative feelings between mortals create a weakening between the Material Plane and the realms of the fey, allowing strifes to enter the material world. Once on the Material Plane, a strife lurks in the shadows of a settlement, fueling rumors until the populace erupts with chaos and discord. Travelers might come across a settlement and be greeted with abnormal hostility when a strife is present. Once its work is done, the strife returns to the fey realms to tell tales of its work before finding a new settlement to disturb. The most successful of strifes have caused kingdoms to fall to civil war when the government was painted as unfit by a strife's work. The strife does not revel in bloodshed, but in the unrest of the days or weeks that precede it.
