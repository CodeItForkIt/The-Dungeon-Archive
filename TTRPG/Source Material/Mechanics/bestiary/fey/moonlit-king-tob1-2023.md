# [Moonlit King](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/moonlit-king-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 176*  

*Dressed in archaic nobleman's finery, this elf lord has wildly unkempt bluish hair and pale, almost luminous skin. His eyes bulge slightly from their sockets as they stare vacantly. The lord's shadow moves slightly out of sync with his body, which appears solid in some portions and nearly transparent in others*.

His Lunar and Royal Majesty, Ludomir Imbrium the XVI, is also known as the Moonlit King of the Shadow Fey, Lord of Shadows, Duke of the Elves, and Master of the Winter Palace. A creature consumed by madness, the Moonlit King is an ephemeral vestige of greatness lost. He barely lives in reality anymore, and he is beset by phantoms from his own mind conjured from shadows and regret.

## Dwindling Power

The Moonlit King lost the favor of his wife, the Queen of Night and Magic, long ago. When he fell from power, the Queen exiled him, banishing him from his seat in the courts of the shadow fey. Now he endures in the crumbling, far-flung Tower of the Moon. The King has sunk deep into madness during his isolation and has turned to bargains with demons and devils in a desperate bid to regain freedom.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## Moonlit King's Lair

The Moonlit King's lair is the Tower of the Moon, which is hidden in a spiral labyrinth deep within the Plane of Shadows. The tower is a run-down, forlorn place filled with false whispers and shadow ghosts of the mad fey lord's own creation.
