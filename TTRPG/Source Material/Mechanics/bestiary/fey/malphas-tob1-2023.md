# [Malphas](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/malphas-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 262*  

*Keen eyed and dangerous, this winged fey warrior is dressed in finery.*

## Sworn to the Shadow Fey

Raised with a sword in their hands, the malphas are fierce warriors who serve the aristocracy of the shadow fey unswervingly.

## Corvid Fey

The malphas have many crow-like features, including beaks, black-feathered bodies and wings, and clawed feet and hands. On occasion, a cloaked ravenfolk traveling in fey lands might be mistaken for a malphas, and some less scrupulous ravenfolk use this to their advantage to manipulate fey they encounter. Malphas don't take kindly to such impersonations and are merciless toward any ravenfolk they discover pretending to be one of them.

## Messengers

Laconic in speech, they nevertheless serve as envoys and messengers from time to time. However, as much or more is communicated by the choice in messenger as in the message itself. Their crow-like features and the tendency of their masters to send bad news via malphas has earned them the nickname "storm crows" among many fey.
