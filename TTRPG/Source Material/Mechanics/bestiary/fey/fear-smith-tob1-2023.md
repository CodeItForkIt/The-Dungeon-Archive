# [Fear Smith](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/fear-smith-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 169*  

*This well-dressed figure appears elven, save for its featureless face and taloned hands.*

Known as a fiarsídhe among themselves, fear smiths are servants of shadow fey courts and other, similar dark fey courts. While its mouth is closed, a fear smith's face is featureless save for rows of deep wrinkles. Opening the large mouth in the center of its face reveals long needlelike teeth surrounding a single, massive eye.

## Icy-Cold Eyes

Fear smiths often serve as torturers or are dispatched to demoralize the court's enemies. Their stare stops enemies cold, making it easy for heavily-armed warriors to trap and finish a foe.

## Devour Fear

Fear smiths feed off strong emotions, and their favorite meal is terror. The fey prefer prolonging the death of victims, and, when free to indulge, a fear smith stalks its victim for days before attacking, hinting at its presence to build dread.

## Hoods and Masks

Fear smiths favor fine clothing and high fashion, donning hooded cloaks or masks when discretion is required. Eerily well-mannered and respectful, fear smiths enjoy feigning civility and playing the part of nobility, speaking genteelly but with a thick, unidentifiable accent.
