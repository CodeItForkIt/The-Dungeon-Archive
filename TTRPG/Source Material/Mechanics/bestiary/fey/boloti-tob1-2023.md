# [Boloti](Mechanics\bestiary\fey/boloti-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 38*  

*This small, leering water spirit resembles a cross between a gray frog and a damp scarecrow, with small tendrils sprouting from all its extremities. It has water wings seemingly made out of jellyfish flesh.*

## Swamp Robbers

Known as uriska in Draconic, the bolotis are small, swamp-dwelling water spirits which delight in drowning unsuspecting victims in shallow pools and springs, then robbing the corpses of whatever shiny objects they find. Bolotis use their magical vortex abilities to immobilize their victims and drag them to a watery death. They delight in storing up larders of victims under winter ice or under logs.

## Fond of Allies

Bolotis sometimes team up with miremals and will-o'-wisps to create cunning ambushes. They are happy with a single kill at a time.
