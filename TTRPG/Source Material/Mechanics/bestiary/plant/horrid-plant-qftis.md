Horrid plants are a family of carnivorous vegetation found in bogs, damp heaths, jungles, and swamps. Some botanists theorize these plants are an invasive species from a faraway world. When still, horrid plants resemble ordinary (if vibrant) foliage.

## Horrid Plant Varieties

The most infamous varieties of horrid plant are dew drinkers, purple blossoms, and snapper saws.

### Dew Drinker

Dew drinkers resemble large cabbage plants until they unfurl their long, hair-tipped tendrils. Dew drinkers use these tendrils to drain the moisture and life force from their prey.

### Purple Blossom

The purple blossom is a treelike plant with cup-shaped purple flowers. Tubules within the plant's branches connect the flowers to reserves of acidic sap in the plant's trunk. Purple blossoms squirt this sap at prey through the flowers' pistils.

### Snapper Saw

Snapper saws resemble ordinary bushes and bear fragrant white berries during temperate seasons. Between encounters, the plant buries its weapons—wide, razor-sharp outer leaves—in the loose dirt around itself to catch unsuspecting prey off guard.
