## Underground Oasis

A vesiculosa is a huge, burrowing pitcher plant that dwells in deserts and oases, spurring nearby growth and luring in prey with soporific scents and tainted water. A vesiculosa's body is buried in the ground, with only its roots in the open in ropy tangles. It leaves the mouth of its water-filled central pitcher open on the surface of the ground, looking like a small oasis. When creatures fall to its sleep-inducing water, the vesiculosa uses its roots to pull them into the soil, waiting for them to die before feasting on the nutrients left by the decaying flesh.

## Rich Sapphire Heartvine

A vesiculosa's heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists. It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging once the plant has been killed.

    \ A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the vesiculosa's water\

- "desc": "When a creature that can smell the vesiculosa's sweet fragrance starts\
