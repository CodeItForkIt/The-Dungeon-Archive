# [Frostveil](Mechanics\bestiary\plant/frostveil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 193*  

*"They took the sled dogs first, and later the seal-skinner set to guard them. We'd hear a confused, muffled cry in the wind and then we'd find themâ€”a raven harvest, cold and stiff on the ice. Next time, we hid ourselves and watched, and we saw them floating through the air like kites. A wisp of blowing snow that never dispersed, a billowing, snowflake sail moving with sinister purpose. The 'cloak of death' our guide called it."*

Whipped through the air by snowstorms and resembling a spider's web dangling with delicate ice crystals, these silently gliding, beautiful killers are semi-sentient plants adapted to the merciless cold of the north.

## Cloak of Death

Flat nodes shaped like large snowflakes connect the frostveil's netlike body and trailing tails of transparent fibers. Gossamer tendrils stream behind and between the flying snowflakes, ready to grab and entangle any warm-blooded creature the frostveil detects.

## Seek Warmth

Each starlike node contains crude sensory organs, able to detect warmth as meager as a living creature's breath and steer the gliding web toward it.

## Spirit Spores

Northern shamans say the dance of the frostveils is beautiful when lit by the northern lights and a powerful omen. With great care, shamans sometimes harvest frostveils for their frozen spore-shards, which grant potent visions of the spirit world when melted on the tongue.
