## Plant Servants

Over time, a vine lord eventually commands a small army of plant creatures, fey, and even plant-based undead, such as vine troll skeletons, to enact its will. When no other allies present themselves, vine lords turn to creating tendril puppets by planting vine roots into humanoids. The vines eventually kill and animate the humanoids, which become mindless servants and expendable scouts. The puppets are connected to each other and the vine lord through a magical "root mind" that relays information almost instantaneously.
