    \ (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it\
    \ has the [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape\
    \ DC 14), and the horrid plant can pull the target up to 25 feet closer to itself.\
    \ Until the grapple ends, the target has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\

    \ until a creature uses its action to scrape the sap off itself or another creature\
    \ it can reach. A creature covered in sap takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the\
    \ start of each of its turns."
