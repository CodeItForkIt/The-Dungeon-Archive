# [Chained Angel](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/chained-angel-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 18*  

*The angel's dark halo, flayed skin, and soulless, rage-filled eyes hint at the horrors it endured to end up shackled at the feet of the demon.*

## Broken and Chained

These angels have been captured by fiends, tortured, and turned to serve darkness. They invariably wear chains, shackles, barbed flesh hooks, or manacles to show their captive state. A pack of chained angels is considered a status symbol among the servants of evil. A chained angel fights for the forces of evil as long as it remains chained, which amuses demons and devils greatly.

## Chance at Redemption

While their souls are tainted with the blood of innocents, in their hearts chained angels still hope to be redeemed, or at least to gain the solace of extinction. Any creature that kills a chained angel receives a gift of gratitude for the release of death. If it cannot be redeemed, a chained angel is a storm of destruction.
