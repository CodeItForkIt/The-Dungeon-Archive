# [Uraeus](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/uraeus-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 373*  

*A sleek serpent wends through the air, held aloft on bronze-feathered wings. The flying cobra flares its hood and hisses, hurling a spray of orange sparks from its fanged mouth.*

Uraeuses resemble vibrantly colored cobras. The serpent's scales are the rich, gold-flecked blue of lapis lazuli and its eyes gleam white. However, its most distinguishing feature is its pair of feathery, bronze wings. It glides gracefully through the air with a deliberate vigilance that reveals its intelligence. A uraeus grows up to three feet long, and weighs around five pounds.

## Divine Protectors

Uraeuses are celestial creatures that carry a spark of divine fire within them, and they thirst for purpose when they arrive on the Material Plane. Whether the creature was deliberately summoned or found its way to the Material Plane through other means, a uraeus is created to protect. Once it finds a worthy charge, it devotes its fiery breath and searing venom to protecting that ward. A uraeus is fanatically loyal to the creature it protects. Only gross mistreatment or vicious evil can drive a uraeus to break its bond and leave.
