# [Valkyrie](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/valkyrie-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 379*  

*These warrior women, armed with cruel-looking swords, sit astride massive winged wolves. Each of them is as beautiful, graceful, and fierce as a well-honed war axe.*

## Choosers of the Slain

Valkyries are sent by Odin to decide the course of battles and harvest the souls of brave fallen warriors. Riding winged wolves (use the statistics of a winter wolf with a flying speed of 80 feet and a neutral alignment), they visit battlefields to do their master's will, surrounded by crows and ravens. Valkyries remain hidden among the ravens during these missions, acting only when fate decrees.

## Love Battle

Valkyries love battle and bloodshed, and their presence on the battlefield inspires warriors to great acts of valor and heroism.

## Neutral Parties

Valkyries seldom interfere in mortal affairs, save to ensure the proper course of battles. When duty demands, as a punishment, or when they fall in love, a valkyrie may wander the mortal world.
