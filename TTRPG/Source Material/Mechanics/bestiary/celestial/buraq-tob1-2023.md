# [Buraq](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/buraq-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 46*  

*An aura of holiness surrounds this handsome human-headed equine with short but strong feathered wings.*

## Only the Worthy

A buraq possesses astounding speed, determination, and resilience, among a host of noble qualities. Only pure-hearted humanoids can obtain a service from such a righteous and honorable creature.

## Angel Marked

Every buraq wears a gilded band around its head or neck. These are said to be angelic seals or wardings, each different. The hide of every buraq is white, though their beards, lashes, manes, and tails vary from silver and dusty tan to deep brown or glossy black.

## Heavenly Steeds

A buraq is smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey, though their carrying capacity belies their size and apparent strength. Nevertheless, a buraq is the ultimate courier and a heavenly steed. Paladins and good-aligned clerics are the most likely candidates to ride a buraq, but other virtuous characters have had this privilege.
