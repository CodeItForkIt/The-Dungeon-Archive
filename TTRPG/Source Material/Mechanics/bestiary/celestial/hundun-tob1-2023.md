# [Hundun](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/hundun-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 237*  

*A toothless mouth adorns the headless shoulders of this oversized, four-armed, doughy humanoid. Colors and half-formed phantasmal shapes appear and vanish around it, to the creature's obvious delight.*

## Creative Chaos

Wise yet child-like creatures of chaos, hunduns are four-armed, headless humanoids that embody spontaneous creation and the confusion that precedes enlightenment. Taking delight in creation of all kinds, they bring change to the staid and stagnant, spin revelation from confusion, and inspire moments of great creation—from works of art to new nations and faiths, and even the formation of planets and planes.

## Nonsense Speech

Although not mindless, hunduns rarely seem to act out of conscious thought; however, their actions seem wise and are usually benevolent. They communicate only in nonsense words but have no trouble communicating among themselves or acting in coordination with other celestials.

## Flesh of Creation

Hundun blood is a powerful catalyst, and their spittle is a potent drug. Each hundun's heart is an Egg of Worlds—an artifact that can give birth to new concepts, powers, or even worlds. Obviously, the hundun must die for its heart to be used this way, but this is a sacrifice one might make willingly under the right circumstances.
