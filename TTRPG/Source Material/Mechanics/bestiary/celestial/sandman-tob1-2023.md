# [Sandman](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/sandman-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 313*  

*Stick-thin and moon-faced with a raptor's eyes and a mane of hawk feathers, this grinning humanoid pirouettes as nimbly as a dancer. Between its long, taloned fingers trickles sand that gleams with the cold light of stars.*

## Bringers of Nightmares

Sandmen are sinister-looking bringers of sleep and dreams. Visiting the mortal world each night, sandmen ensure that their targets slumber deeply and experience vivid dreams that swell the dream realm's power. Some sandmen develop a talent for a specific flavor of dream; fantasies of lost love or childhood, prophecies and religious visions, or terrible nightmares.

## Abduct Dreamers

Powerful dreamers attract both the attention and the protection of sandmen: children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes. They protect such charges fiercely but have also been known to abduct them, taking them on wild adventures to inspire yet greater dreams. To them, all dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying. Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by concerns over good and evil.

## Ethereal Dreamscapes

When not on the Material Plane, sandmen ride bubble-like dreamscapes through the Ethereal Plane, breaching the Sea of Possibilities, nurturing and harvesting its contents. Sandmen are a common and welcome sight in markets across the Fey Realms, elemental planes, and even in Hellâ€”anywhere that dreams or nightmares are a valuable commodity. They are merciless to any who threaten the sanctity of dreams, but especially dream eaters.
