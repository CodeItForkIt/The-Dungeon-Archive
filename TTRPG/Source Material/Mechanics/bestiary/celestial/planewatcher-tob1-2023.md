# [Planewatcher](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/planewatcher-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 293*  

*The brilliant lasso tightened around the eldritch monster as the faceless winged creature dragged it across a hellish landscape.*

A planewatcher is sworn to protect the order of the boundaries between worlds. These angelic creatures fearlessly track down people and monsters who cross the boundaries of the planes and drag them back to where they came from, willingly or otherwise. Each planewatcher is bound to a single plane of existence.

## Friend or Foe

Planewatchers are dedicated to their purpose, regardless of morality. Heroes may find themselves beseeching a planewatcher for help to battle an interplanar foe, or find themselves fighting one while on a planar mission. Planewatchers track down trespassers based on the perceived threat to the multiverse.

## Unlikely Allies

Star drakes protect the Material Plane in much the same way planewatchers protect their respective planes. Because of this, the Material Plane has fewer planewatchers than other planes, and the two beings can work in concert to maintain the natural order of the multiverse.
