# [Angel](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/angel-psk.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 27*  

Angels are mysterious, detached beings seldom glimpsed by mortal eyes. They are the living incarnations of white mana, and embody its inherent tendencies toward order and harmony. Some inventors view angels in the context of the Aether Cycle as an expression of a Great Design. Given divine inspiration and an utterly perfect stage of innovation, an angel is the constructed resultâ€”a living invention. Their masks, headdresses, and armor give them an almost mechanical appearance, but they are living beings with brightly colored skin almost entirely concealed beneath their armor and decorative robes. Because of their perfection, angels are believed to be immune to the final stages of the Aether Cycle, which would involve their destruction.

The people of Kaladesh do not worship angels or beseech their intervention in mortal affairs, and such prayers would go unheard anyway. The solitary angels interact with each other only in formal, nuanced rituals whose meanings are obscure. But the sight of an angel is thought to be a good omen, and in particular, it is believed to presage success with invention.

Use the statistics of a [deva](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) for an angel on Kaladesh. Some angels (such as the one shown on the Angel of Invention card (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=547813)) wield four swords with their four arms. When such an angel uses the Multiattack action, it makes four attacks rather than two. However, its weapons deal only an extra `1d10` radiant damage from its Angelic Weapons trait, so that each sword attack deals 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage plus 5 (`1d10`) radiant damage on a hit.
