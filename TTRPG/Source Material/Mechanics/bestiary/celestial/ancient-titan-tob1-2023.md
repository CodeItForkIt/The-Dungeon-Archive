*Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharp-edged features that seem hewn from ancient stone.*

## Children of the Gods

Ancient titans are the surviving immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.

## Sea God's Servants

A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand sixty feet tall and weigh over twenty tons.

## Friends to Dragons

Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind dragons and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.

## Primordial Power

The children of an ancient god, titans have a measure of the god's power. They know and command primordial words that can influence the world and creatures around them by tapping into the energy that created the world.
