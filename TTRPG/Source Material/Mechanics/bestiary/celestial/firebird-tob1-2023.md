*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 187*  

*This proud bird struts like a peacock, made all the more majestic by its flaming fan of feathers, which shift through the color spectrum.*

## Guides and Helpers

Firebirds are welcome sights to those in need of warmth and safety. They primarily work at night or in underground areas, where their talents are most needed. Friendly to all creatures, they become aggressive only upon witnessing obviously evil acts. Firebirds enjoy working with good adventuring parties, providing light and healing, though their wanderlust prevents them from staying for long.

## Redeemers

Firebirds enjoy acting as reformers. They search for creatures they perceive as potential "light bringers," and they grant boons to such creatures, magically coaxing the creatures into performing good deeds in the hope such acts redeem the creatures.

## Magical Feathers

Firebird feathers are prized throughout the mortal world, and occasionally, the creatures bestow feathers upon those they favor. Firebirds also seed hidden locations with specialized feathers, which burst into full-grown firebirds after a year. Firebirds live over 100 years.
