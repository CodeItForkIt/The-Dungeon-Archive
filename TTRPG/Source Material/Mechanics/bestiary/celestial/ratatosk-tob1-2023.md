# [Ratatosk](Mechanics\bestiary\celestial/ratatosk-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 301*  

*The chattering squirrel creature has tiny tusks and fur that shimmers in a way that defies the surrounding light.*

## Sleek-Furred Celestials

The ratatosk is a celestial being that is very much convinced of its own indispensable place in the multiverse. Its fur is sleek, and it takes great pride in the cleaning and maintenance of its tusks.

## Planar Messengers

Ratatosks were created to carry messages across the planes, bearing word between gods and their servants. Somewhere across the vast march of ages, their nature twisted away from that purpose. Much speculation as to the exact cause of this change continues to occupy sages.

## Maddening Gossips

Ratatosks are insatiable tricksters. Their constant chatter is not the mere nattering of their animal counterparts; it is a never-ending celestial gossip network. Ratatosks delight in learning secrets and spreading those secrets in mischievous ways. It's common for two listeners to hear vastly different words when a ratatosk speaksâ€”and for that misunderstanding to lead to blows.
