These monstrous spiders, the spawn of the divine Spider Queen, lurk in the darkest recesses of the world. They have gorged themselves on the ichor of demons since the earliest days of the "Calamity", when demons were slain in such quantity that the subterranean depths were awash with their foul blood.

## Monstrosities Transformed

Demonfeed spiders are terrible fiends as a result of having supped upon the remains of demons, but all are descended from the overlarge spiders that haunt caverns and forests across Tal'Dorei. As such, most are native to the Material Plane, so that once killed, they are slain foreverâ€”unlike fiends that are simply banished to their home plane.

## Endless Hunger

No sustenance is more delectable to a demonfeed spider than the ichor remaining behind after a demon has been slain on the Material Plane. However, in the absence of such remains, they will sate themselves on the fluids of any living creature.

## Toxic Blood

The terrible poison of spiders, when mixed with the vile ichor of demons, becomes the demonfeed spider's most potent weapon. When its chitinous hide is pierced and its blood begins to flow, the spider can expel arcing sprays of caustic blood that seep into the exposed flesh of its attackers.

## Alignment

Chaotic evil.
