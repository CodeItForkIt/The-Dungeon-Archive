# [Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/demon-psx.md)
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 36*  

Resembling twisted bats, the demons of Ixalan are the spawn of a bat-god, the source of all darkness. While the sun's aspects include destruction as well as creation and growth, the demons represent stagnation and decay. The sun consumes in glorious fire; demons work through rot and degeneration. They are said to be active at night, when the sun is hidden, and their efforts are directed toward preventing the sun from rising again each morning. In the meantime, they spread plague and corruption across the land. The [vrock](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) in the "Monster Manual" is a good representation of Ixalan's demons.

## Night Terrors

The legends of the Sun Empire are populated with the enemies of the sun—terrible monsters that threaten to devour its light and undo its work. Unfortunately for the people of Ixalan, these are not just creatures of legend but real monsters with supernatural power, lurking in the darkness of night and the shadows of ancient ruins and crypts.
