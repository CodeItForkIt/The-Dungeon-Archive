# [Crystalline Devil](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/crystalline-devil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 94*  

*This gem-encrusted devil grins with jagged teeth and bares claws as sharp as glass.*

## Gem-Coated

Crystalline devils resemble gem-coated humanoids with cruel, twisted faces, jagged teeth, and terrible talons like shards of broken glass. Their feet, however, are soft and bare, allowing them to pad along in silence as they seek a favorable spot to assume gem form.

## Winking Jewels

In its treasure form, a crystalline devil resembles a sparkling jewel, glowing with a warm inner light. It seeks to catch the eye of an unwary creature whose mind it might corrupt to greed and murder. If its identity is discovered in gem form, it reassumes its normal form and attacks.

## Passed Along

After insinuating themselves into groups, crystalline devils encourage betrayal and murder, then persuade a host to pass on their treasure as atonement for their crimes.
