# [Spawn of Arbeyach](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/spawn-of-arbeyach-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 91*  

*This insectile humanoid's mouth stretches over dripping mandibles that are poorly concealed behind an ill-fitting mask of flesh. Its eyes have compound irises, and barbed stingers sprout between the fingers at the ends of its long, segmented limbs.*

Spawn of Arbeyach are extensions of the will of Hell's Prince of Swarms, Arbeyach, and often serve him in the mortal world as the arch-devil carries out their master's wishes. To this end, they often inhabit hives of tosculi that worship Arbeyach.

## Skin and Carapace

Spawn of Arbeyach are roughly humanoid, with many insectoid qualities, including a hardened carapace and oddly-jointed limbs. Their faces, arms, and legs are covered with a largely decorative skin which stretches and tears to reveal insectile traits.

## Hive Dwellers

They dwell in hive structures comprised of natural growth and rigid architecture. The hives are built in isolated, easily-defensible locales, and visitors often must climb or fly to reach them.
