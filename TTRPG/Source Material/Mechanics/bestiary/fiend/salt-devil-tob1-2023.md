# [Salt Devil](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/salt-devil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 100*  

*The creature's skin sparkles with fine salt crystals as it brandishes a scimitar and jagged claws.*

## Sparkly Crystals

Salt devils have sharp, crystalline teeth, sparkling skin studded with fine salt crystals, and long claws that leave jagged, burning wounds. They can also fight with salt‑encrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.

## Servants of Mammon

Salt devils claim to serve the devil-god Mammon. They often ally with gnolls and slavers with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites or just to poison the water.

## Slavers and Corruptors

Salt devils create slave markets and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those indentured into their service. They often forge alliances with mortals when partners are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and greedy than one might expect of Mammon's servants, preferring to encourage corruption in others.
