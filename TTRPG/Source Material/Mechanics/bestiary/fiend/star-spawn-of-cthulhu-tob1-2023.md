# [Star-Spawn of Cthulhu](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/star-spawn-of-cthulhu-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 348*  

*This enormous and strange octopoid creature has clawed hands, a powerful but distended cranium, and winglike spines on its back.*

These masters of psychic communication and dimensional manipulation can transport themselves and others across enormous distances.

## Mastery of Life and Destruction

The star-spawn of Cthulhu harnessed mysterious energies of life and destruction to grow new life with remarkable speed (and some degree of wastage and cancerous tumors) and to turn living flesh into miasmic vapor through nothing more than focused attention.

## Rituals to Cthulhu

Their goals are simple: oppose the mi-go and aid dread Cthulhu. The starâ€‘spawn destroy creatures that will not serve as slaves and sacrifices, rather than allowing them to serve another master. Above all, they insist that all creatures venerate great Cthulhu and sacrifice life and treasure in his name. Their ultimate aim is to bend the heavens themselves and ensure that the stars are rightly positioned in their orbits to herald Cthulhu's inevitable return.
