# [Stuhac](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/stuhac-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 351*  

*This pale-skinned, white-bearded hermit wears a winter cloak and travels the mountain paths, cliff sides, and trade routes alone.*

## Feigns Weakness

Living in isolated mountain passes and foraging along little-traveled slopes, the stuhac is a master of stealth and deception. Wrapping heavy furs around itself, it poses as a feeble hermit or traveler needing assistance. Only after its victims have been lured away from warmth and safety does the stuhac drop its disguise and show its true nature: the withered traveler's gnarled hands uncurl to reveal jagged yellow claws, its cataract-ridden eyes are exposed as waxen orbs wobbling loosely in their sockets, and its clothing is revealed to be woven layers of yellowed tendon and ligament.

## Hideous Garments

The stuhac's most prized possessions are its "clutters," garments woven of layered and tangled ligaments and tendons. These grisly trophies are taken from scores of victims, and stuhacs treasure each bit of their disgusting attire. When two stuhacs meet, they compare their garb, swapping anecdotes of their most horrifying kills and deceptions. Stuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their still-living victims watch. Lying in crippled agony, they cannot flee as the stuhac tears fresh material from their bodies for its garments. To keep screams from disturbing their work, these monsters first sever their victim's vocal chords.

## Devour Victims

Once its clutters are done, the stuhac feeds on its live victim, devouring everything but the bones. Finding a clean-picked humanoid skeleton along a mountain path is a reliable sign of a stuhac's presence.

    \ and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check to discern that the stuhac is disguised."
