# [Herald of Darkness](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/herald-of-darkness-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 233*  

*A tall and beautiful fiend, this creature resembles a dark-haired fey wearing a cloak and armor glittering with dark light.*

Heralds of darkness speak in fluid tones and sing with the voices of angels, but their hearts are foul and treacherous.

## Vision of Evil

Heralds of darkness can take on another appearance entirely, disappearing into insubstantial shadows and unveiling an evil majestic form that leaves those who see it shaken and weakâ€”and often blind. Speaking of this form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and the slow death of innocents carried along in a glacial river, rushing to an inevitable doom.

## Sword and Cloak

The black sword and star-scattered cloak of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and cannot be parted from it. Some believe the cloak and blade are true visions of its body, and that the smiling face and pleasing form are entirely illusory.

## Corruptors of the Fey

Heralds of darkness are companions and sometimes masters to the shadow fey. They seek to draw many others into their orbit with wild promises of great power, debauchery, and other delights. They are rivals to the heralds of blood and bitter foes to all angels of light.
