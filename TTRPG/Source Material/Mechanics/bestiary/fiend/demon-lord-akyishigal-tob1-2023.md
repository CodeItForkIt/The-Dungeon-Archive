# [Demon Lord Akyishigal](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/demon-lord-akyishigal-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 74*  

*This insectoid creature's filth-slicked mandibles clack ceaselessly for flesh.*

Of all the demons lurking in the Abyss, few are as vile and disgusting as Akyishigal, the Lord of Cockroaches.

## Civilization's Corruption

Although Akyishigal sired an entire race in his image, known as roachlings, he craves followers among humans, elves, and other races as a means of corrupting civilization and rotting it from within. Despite his repulsiveness, Akyishigal has followers among the urban dispossessed, the slum-dwelling poor, and those who lurk in lightless undercities. His shrines are tended in abandoned houses, tanneries, and butcher yards, as well as in sewers and similar places.

## Filth Sacrifices

In his shrines, kidnapped victims find themselves submerged in filth up to their necks. While the demon lord's cultists chant, sacramental roaches feast on the prisoner's eyes and tongue. A victim who survives the rite is dumped back onto the streets.

## Persistent Cults

Akyishigal's cults are almost as difficult to stamp out as real cockroach infestations. No matter how they are driven off or crushed, followers resurface among the teeming mobs of the downtrodden. Typical worshipers include evil humanoids, particularly kobolds and goblins, as well as roachlings, minor demons, slaves, thralls, and shadow creatures of all stripes.
