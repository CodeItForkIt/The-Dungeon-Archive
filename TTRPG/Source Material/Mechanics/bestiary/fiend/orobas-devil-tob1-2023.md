# [Orobas Devil](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/orobas-devil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 99*  

*Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with well-chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and hoofed feet.*

Orobas devils thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who have the coin or souls. The common phrase, "never trust a gift horse," stems from these corrupting devils.

## Horse-Headed but Wise

Orobas devils look like horrific horse-headed humans. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils, and flames dance across their flails. This beast-like appearance belies their true strength; these devils possess an uncanny prescience and affinity for divination.

## Masters of Deceit

When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfully—or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile.

## Surrounded by Lessers

Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces.
