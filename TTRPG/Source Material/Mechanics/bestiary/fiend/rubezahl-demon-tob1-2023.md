# [Rubezahl Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/rubezahl-demon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 87*  

*A pair of immense, branching antlers arches above this man's coldly gleaming eyes, and wicked claws tip his long fingers.*

## Assume Mortal Form

Rubezahls are capricious creatures with an affinity for weather, particularly lightning. Like the ever-changing weather, they are driven by constantly shifting motivations and mannerisms. They are consummate tricksters who delight in taking the form of innocuous mortals, like traveling monks, tinkers, or lost merchants. They love to play the friend with their nearly undetectable lies, slipping into the confidence of unsuspecting mortals before murdering them.

## Counting Demons

Rubezahls have a weakness, however. They are known as counting demons, and a savvy mortal who knows its nature can confound one with groups of objects: a handful of coins, a basket of apples, even a bed of flowers. If the objects are clearly pointed out to the rubezahl, the creature becomes distracted until it counts each item in the group. Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast; even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments for a rubezahl to assess. Rubezahl loathe being compelled this way, and they are driven to annihilate any mortal bold enough to exploit this weakness.
