# [Gilded Devil](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/gilded-devil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 95*  

*This tall, bronze-complexioned man is abnormally long-limbed and clad in armor of stained and battered coins. His wiry frame is festooned with mismatched bracelets, rings, and necklaces, each gaudier than the last.*

## Servants of Mammon

Rarely seen in their natural form outside of Hell, gilded devils are the servitors of the devil‑god Mammon, Lord of Greed. They tempt and corrupt with promises of wealth and power, twisting mortal greed into sure damnation.

## Impression of Wisdom

When pursuing a mortal of high standing, gilded devils prefer unassuming appearances, molding their flesh and gaudy trappings to make themselves look the parts of wise advisers, canny merchants, or sly confidants. Even in their humblest form, gilded devils always wear a piece of golden jewelry or a jeweled button or ornament.
