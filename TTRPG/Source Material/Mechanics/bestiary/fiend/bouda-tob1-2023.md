# [Bouda](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/bouda-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 42*  

*A hulking, hyena-faced humanoid with a heavily scarred, oversized muzzle steps forward, clouds of gnats and fleas roiling around it.*

## Glowing Eyes and Teeth

Bouda are peopleeaters and despoilers of purity and family. Resembling oversized gnolls, the web of scars along their muzzles provides evidence of their gluttonous eating habits. Forever leering, their teeth glow as yellow as their eyes.

## Fly-Bedecked Shapechangers

Bouda lurk on society's fringes, shapechanging to blend in with mortals. They seek out happy families, consuming the most vulnerable members in the night and leaving gruesome trophies behind. They may mark a victim nights before attacking to terrify the helpless family.

## Gluttons

Bouda have a weakness: they are incorrigible gluttons. When presented with a fresh corpse, even in combat, they attempt to gorge on it or at least defile it for later consumption. Bouda are vindictive, seeking revenge on anything that drives them from a kill.
