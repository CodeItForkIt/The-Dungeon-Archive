# [Arch-Devil Ia'Affrat](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/arch-devil-iaaffrat-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 90*  

*A dark, droning cloud containing thousands of gray, thumb-sized wasps, shifts and swarms around the black silhouette of a tall human with glowing red eyes. The wasps, too, glow with the heat of a low-burning coal and are wreathed in foul-smelling smoke.*

## Faithless Servant

Ia'Affrat the Insatiable is the inverted reflection of his unkempt, overly-unyielding creator, Arbeyach, Hell's Prince of Swarms. Ia'Affrat acts as Arbeyach's emissary to the courts of his rivals and to the mortal world as diplomat, spy, assassin, and scourge. Though he serves the rigid and resolute Prince of Hell, Ia'Affrat shows little loyalty to his maker. The eloquent and sophisticated creature has betrayed his master in thousands of small ways over the centuries, and eventually may betray him utterly. Until then, Ia'Affrat's shifting hive mind pursues an unquenchable lust for arcane mysteries, human interaction, and the material pursuit of unwholesome flavors and dark delights.

## Joker and Devourer

Ia'Affrat delights in comedy, wine, song, dance, food, and inflicting torture and public humiliation on his foes—he is a rapacious devourer, greedy for all transient pleasures.
