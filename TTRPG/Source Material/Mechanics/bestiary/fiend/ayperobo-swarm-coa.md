# [Ayperobo Swarm](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/ayperobo-swarm-coa.md)
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 238*  

An individual ayperobo is practically harmless, and often eaten by larger devils as a delicacy. Recognizing their weakness, ayperobos gather together and create colonies that communicate using telepathy. These swarms are much stronger, capable of holding their own even against some of the greater devils.

## Something to Prove

Their perfect communication and collective strength, coupled with their ability for flight, allow the ayperobos to easily complete tasks with which larger devils struggle. They're happy to do so, as their goal is to prove their worth and, when possible, get revenge for their abusive treatment at the hands of larger devils.

## Small but Deadly

Each member of the swarm appears as a small, devilish being, with oversized heads and sparrow-like wings. Their teeth are razor sharp, and when working together in a swarm, they can devour a Humanoid in a matter of seconds. While swarming, ayperobos appear as a thick cloud of mosquitoes or a cloud of blood—and are known to hide among such phenomena. Some swarms have the power to control a "host" by burrowing under its skin and manipulating it from the inside—these hosts can even be other devils.

    \ turn, taking actions based on their host. If a host dies while the ayperobo\
    \ swarm is burrowed, they leave the host at the end of the host's turn, rolling\
