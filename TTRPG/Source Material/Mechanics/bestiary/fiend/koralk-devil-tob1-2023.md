# [Koralk Devil](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/koralk-devil-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 97*  

*The fiendish hulk bears features taken from a nightmare scorpion, with three stinging tails and four limbs. It wields a massive scythe.*

## Shaped by Arbeyach

These fiends sprang from the dark imagination of Hell's Prince of Swarms, Arbeyach, who twisted them into being from lemures and scorpions. Arbeyach shaped the koralk to be annihilators in battle and to gather souls from the fallen, bypassing typical soul collection methods to feed his war machine more quickly. They are sometimes called "harvester devils."

## Transforming Poison

Poison from the koralk's stingers liquefies the victim's insides in an agonizing transformation. The creature swells as its organs, muscles, and skeleton rapidly break down and reform, transforming the creature into a lemure in a burst of fiendish goo. The new lemure is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from that moment on is the same as any lemure's. The koralk's poison can work this transformation on demons, giving Arbeyach's armies a unique edge.

## Infernal Mounts

A koralk is strong enough for many devils to ride. They prefer only powerful devils as riders, but they obey their superiors and carry even the lowest of devils into battle if directed. Arbeyach often rides an especially large specimen into battle, called the Grand Annihilator by his devilish troops.
