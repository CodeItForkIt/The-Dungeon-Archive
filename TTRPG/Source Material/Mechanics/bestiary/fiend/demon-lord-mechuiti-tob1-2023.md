# [Demon Lord Mechuiti](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/demon-lord-mechuiti-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 78*  

*A yellow-green fire burns atop the head of this towering, redfurred demon, which resembles an enormous mandrill. It has massive, muscular arms tipped with razor-sharp claws, a slavering jaw filled with huge fangs, and tusks that curl back almost to its blue cheeks.*

Towering around 25 feet tall, Mechuiti, Lord of Cannibal Apes, can stand erect like a human or walk on his knuckles, like a great ape.

## Bloodskull Island

After being expelled from the sweltering jungles and deadly swamps of the Hell of Cannibals, Mechuiti was coughed out of a volcanic portal onto an island now called Bloodskull. Here, he schemes and plots his revenge while breeding demonic minions.

## Corruptor of the Behtu

When Mechuiti first arrived on the Material Plane, he enthralled a group of jungle-dwelling simians, known as the behtu, by visiting their leaders and priests in dreams and nightmares. After convincing these leaders to come to his volcanic home, he infected them with his demonic ichor, transforming them in mind and body, and taught them tattoo magic to give them fiendish power and strength. They returned to their people with this new power and knowledge of the ritual for transforming the rest of their people.

## Bound But Dangerous

Only with the most powerful magic and technology did the ancient people bind him within Bloodskull Island's volcano—the best they could accomplish, since they couldn't destroy him. Despite imprisonment, Mechuiti has remained a terror through the ages. The behtu have not found the key to their master's release, but they still torture and ensorcel unlucky explorers who stumble into their abode, hoping to find someone who can unlock their master's prison.

## Commander of Monsters

Mechuiti commands the behtu to breed fiendish beasts and lizards with his blood: dire apes, fiery giant lizards, and even demonic spiders. He has raised generations of flame dragons, which lair in the volcano's caldera, to guard his temple-fane and deal with threats beyond the behtus' reach.

## Mechuiti's Lair

Mechuiti is trapped within the volcano in his island prison. However, imprisonment hasn't prevented Mechuiti from mustering an army and turning his confinement into a nightmarish bastion.
