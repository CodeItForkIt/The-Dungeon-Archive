# [Dream Eater](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/dream-eater-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 148*  

*This tattered skeletal humanoid resembles a monster from a nightmare with vestigial skeletal wings with a few feathers, small horns, sharp teeth, and cloven hooves.*

## Drawn to Sin

Dream eaters are dedicated to lust, gluttony, and greed. They make their lairs in casinos, brothels, thieves' dens, and other locations where gambling, food, and other pleasures are readily available. Sometimes dream eaters work together to create such a place, especially near large towns or cities. Some band together to create traveling shows, offering all the oddities, whimsies, and flights of fantasy customary for such entertainers.

## Devouring Hopes

Dream eaters lure people into their lairs, enticing them with promises of pleasure or wealth. Of course, they make sure the odds are stacked in their favor. Eventually, their victims are left with nothing. Worse than the loss of physical treasures, dream eaters leave their victims stripped of hopes and aspirations. Dream eaters feed on emotions, leaving helpless thralls willing to sell their souls for their vices.
