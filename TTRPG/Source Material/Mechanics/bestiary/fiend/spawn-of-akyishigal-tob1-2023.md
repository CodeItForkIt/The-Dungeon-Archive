# [Spawn of Akyishigal](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/spawn-of-akyishigal-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 75*  

*This human-sized insectoid has a tail that splits near the end curling over its back. Both ends bear needle-stingers dripping with poison.*

Spawn of Akyishigal are found in abundance wherever the demon lord abides. He has also been known to send them to his followers if their need is great and the spawn's presence somehow benefits Akyishigal.

## Lords of Vermin

Vermin of all types instinctively obey mental commands from a spawn of Akyishigal. What's more, these repulsive beings can vomit thousands of roaches that also do the spawn's bidding. They take particular delight in belching roaches directly onto their foes, but they've also been known to use roaches and vermin as a means of cutting off an enemy's retreat or of hindering pursuit when the spawn itself wants to escape.
