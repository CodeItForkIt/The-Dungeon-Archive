# [Malakbel Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/malakbel-demon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 85*  

*Within a blinding wave of heat and glare walks a long-limbed, misshapen form. The creature scorches everything in its path as it strides forward.*

What most people recall most vividly from an encounter with a malakbel is the blinding light and blistering heat surrounding it. Rippling distortion obscures the creature's body, which is roughly the size and shape of an adult human.

## Demonic Messengers

Malakbel demons are contradictory creatures. They are both messengers and destroyers who carry the words of demon lords or even dark gods to the mortal realm. Paradoxically, once their message is delivered, they often leave none of its hearers alive to spread the tale.

## Where Virtue Cannot Look

The malakbel is the embodiment of all that is forbidden and destructive. Despite its vital role as a messenger, its destructive nature always comes to the fore. A malakbel descends upon settlements and travelers with the merciless and relentless onslaught of the raging sun, burning all it sees to cinders before vanishing like heat shimmers at dusk.
