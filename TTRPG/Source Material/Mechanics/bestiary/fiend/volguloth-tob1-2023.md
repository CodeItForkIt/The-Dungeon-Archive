# [Volguloth](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/volguloth-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 391*  

*What at first appears to be a humanoid wearing voluminous robes is a thin, fiendish figure whose skin drapes about its form like a wet shroud.*

These minor fiends are often found in the service of more powerful fiends or, occasionally, powerful mortals. Volguloths are quiet, efficient killers and often act as assassins. They are sadistic and cruel, reveling in the deaths they cause, and are loathe to turn their stealthy skills to less violent tasks, such as theft or reconnaissance.

## Skin Shroud

A volguloth's skin behaves more like a sinuous sheet of muscle, contracting and expanding as the volguloth requires. Typically, it drapes the fiend's form like a robe. However, the volguloth can tighten it to a rumpled but close-fitting hide or extend it into long sheets. This allows it to glide short distances or enwrap and smother victims, engulfing them in the folds of its skin and squeezing them until they run out of air.
