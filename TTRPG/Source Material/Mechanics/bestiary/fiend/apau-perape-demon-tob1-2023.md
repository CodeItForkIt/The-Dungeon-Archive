# [Apau Perape Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/apau-perape-demon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 82*  

*Sharp teeth fill this large, demonic ape's mouth. Its long, muscular arms stretch to the ground, ending in wickedly curved claws.*

## Servants of Fire

These black-furred gorilla demons serve only Mechuiti, the demon lord of fire and apes. Their final loyalty is unshakable, though sometimes they serve others for a time. They have no fear of fire, gleefully setting villages and crops aflame if their master is snubbed or insulted.

## Fearless Attackers

The apau perape are fearless and savage, living for battle. Once in combat, their morale never breaks. Like their master, they have an insatiable hunger and leave no dead behind, consuming even the bones.

## Eyes of Fire

When this demon is angered, its eyes glow a deep, disturbing red, unlike any natural ape.
