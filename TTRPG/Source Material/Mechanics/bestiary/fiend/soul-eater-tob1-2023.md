# [Soul Eater](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/soul-eater-tob1-2023.md)

*The creature walks on crab-like legs, carrying a fleshy, ectoplasm-filled mass on its back.*

## Merchants from the Lower Planes

Soul eaters are soul-collecting fiends from the Lower Planes where they freely barter for prey. When a soul eater dies, the souls it carried are released and returned to their bodies or to their appropriate final destinations. Regardless, a dead soul eater has no souls for the demons and devils who value souls as currency. This gives soul eaters a measure of safety and power in the Lower Planes, and many of them operate as neutral merchants among other fiends.

## Hatred of the Sun God

Soul eaters bear a particular antipathy for followers of the deities of the sun. They go to great lengths to kill any such deity's clergy, even defying the wishes of their fiendish superiors on occasion.
