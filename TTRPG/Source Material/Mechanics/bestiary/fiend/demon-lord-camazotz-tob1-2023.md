# [Demon Lord Camazotz](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/demon-lord-camazotz-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 76*  

*This hunched, lean man is covered in short, black fur and has large, membranous wings. His lips, pulled back in a sinister smile, reveal a mouth lined with crooked, needlelike teeth. His eyes glow red like burning embers of hate. Long arms end in cruel claws, and the air around him shimmers with waves of intense heat*.

## Underworld Bat Lord

Camazotz, the Lord of Bats and Fire, is a being of pure savagery and hatred—a vile demon that holds sway over bats, vampires, and the lightless places of the underworld. In the deep recesses of the earth and the caves connecting to the surface, he waits restlessly until the slow creep of night engulfs the land, releasing him to feed and spread terror.

## New Fiery Mantle

Recently, Camazotz stole the fire aspect of the decrepit Huhueteotl, Lord of the Hearth and the Fire of Life. With his new prestige, Camazotz has attracted new followers, served notice to the gods of his ascendancy, and solidified his place in the Abyss as a power to be respected. Cults of derro, goblins, and humans praise his name in the darkness.

## Emerging from Darkness

Like the bats he commands, Camazotz much prefers darkness to light, but with his new ability to play with fire and light, he grows increasingly confident in daylight.

> [!note] Camazotz in the Real World
> 
> A cult dedicated to an anthropomorphic deity with the body of a human and the head of a bat emerged around 100 BCE with the Zapotec Indians of southwest Mexico. This god was associated with night, death, and sacrifice. In time, the veneration of Camazotz, or Cama Zotz (translated as "death bat" or "snatch bat"), found its way into Maya lore.
> 
> In older editions of the world's greatest roleplaying game, there was some debate as to whether Zotzilaha was another name for Camazotz, but in Central American lore, there was no debate. The Popol Vuh, a sacred Maya text, clearly identifies Zotzilaha as the cavernous "house of bats" where Camazotz resides, not an entity.
> 
> The Camazotz myth may have sprung from a real creature. Fossil records found in Central and South America dating back approximately 2,000 years reveal the existence of an abnormally large bat with a wingspan of as much as 10 feet! This super-bat, called*Desmodus draculae*, may have co-existed with the early Zapotecs and been the source of their Camazotz legends.
> 
> Belief in bat demons is widespread throughout Mesoamerica: Hik'al, or "neck-slitter," of Chiapas; Socouyant of Trinidad; and Tin Tin of Ecuador. Cryptozoologists believe that those monstrous bats may still be alive today, as reports of giant, bat-like creatures occasionally surface throughout Latin America, from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to Brazil, from Puerto Rico to Mexico.
