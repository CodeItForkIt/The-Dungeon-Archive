# [Herald of Blood](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/herald-of-blood-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 232*  

*The giant has bruised, purple skin and wart-like blood blisters that deform its features. It wears cowled robes, and its staff is ebony and mithral embedded with precious stones.*

As powerful sorcerers and blood mages, heralds of blood are without peer. They enjoy enslaving ogres and giants whenever possible, though they make do with lesser slaves when they must.

## Dark Prophets

Their stirring speeches proclaim that the end times are fast approaching and that all must prepare for a bloody reckoning. Their charismatic preaching serves various elder earthly gods, who demand blood sacrifices, and dark druid orders devoted to hunting and murdering innocents. They have the power to grant strength, lust, and vitalityâ€”or to wither those who cross them.

## Blood Magic Vortexes

Beneath their giant-like veneer, heralds of blood are swirling vortexes of blood, bone, and raw magical power. They feed on ley line magic and the black blood of the earth as much as on flesh and blood.
