# [Demon Lord Qorgeth](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/demon-lord-qorgeth-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 80*  

*This massive undulating worm-like creature crushes trees and cracks stone.*

Qorgeth, the Writhing Prince, Pale Maw, the Devourer, is the lord of worms and decay. Its presence seeps into the world of mortals via the trails of worms and maggots through rotting flesh. The demon lord views all things that live, or once lived, as its property in the making. Everything becomes its food eventually.

## Fiendish Worm

An impossibly massive, pale-fleshed worm, Qorgeth's segmented body is road-mapped with pale veins of pink and blue. When it opens its massive maw, it reveals a writhing mass of smaller worms, many of which are adorned with wailing or enraged humanoid heads.

## Qorgeth's Lair

Qorgeth's lair is a tangled labyrinth of tunnels in the heart of its dark realm. The tunnels seem to twist and burrow through space itself rather than just the rock and soil surrounding them.
