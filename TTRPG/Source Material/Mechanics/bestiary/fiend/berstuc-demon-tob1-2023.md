# [Berstuc Demon](Mechanics\bestiary\fiend/berstuc-demon-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 83*  

*Although slightly stooped, this male figure is muscular and broad‑shouldered. The creature's head is lost in a riot of moss, while a thick mustache and beard reach almost to its waist.*

The hulking, moss-haired berstuc looks sculpted out of a primordial forest—it stands over 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. Despite its great stature, it seems strangely gentle, with a serene, almost soothing presence. Nothing could be further from the truth; the berstuc is a murderous demon that stalks woodlands and jungles of the Material Plane.

## Poisoned Fruit

Berstuc prowl forests in search of travelers to torment. A berstuc demon poses as a benevolent, or at least indifferent, wood spirit to gain the trust of mortals. It allows itself to be persuaded to help lost travelers (reluctantly) or to lead them to their destinations. Once it draws its unwitting prey deep into the woods, it strikes.

    \ and [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it has total cover\
    \ from attacks and other effects outside the berstuc, and it takes 21 (6d6)\
    \ poison damage at the start of each of the berstuc's turns. The berstuc can have\
    \ only one creature enclosed at a time.\n\nIf the berstuc takes 30 damage or more\
    \ on a single turn from a creature inside its growth, the berstuc must succeed\
    \ on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or expel the enclosed\
    \ creature as the growth bursts. The expelled creature falls [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ in a space within 5 feet of the berstuc. If the berstuc dies, an enclosed creature\
    \ is no longer [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by it and\
    \ can escape from the growth by using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
