# [Tusked Skyfish](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/tusked-skyfish-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 372*  

*This creature looks like an enormous flying jellyfish, with long, wicked tusks curving from its gaping mouth and tentaclewhiskers trailing behind it.*

## Alchemical Flotation

These aerial jellyfish waft through the air like balloons, suspended by internal alchemical reactions. This mode of movement takes them vertically when they wish or allows them to drift with the winds. They can reach altitudes of 30,000 feet.

## Shocking Tendrils

Tusked skyfish catch slow-moving or inattentive prey in their tentacles, and they sometimes fish in shallow lakes and streams. They can suppress their natural electrical charge, allowing them to manipulate objects or interact with other creatures safely.

## Slow Mounts

When fitted with special, electricity-resistant saddles, tusked skyfish can be ridden without harming their riders, although their slow speed makes them most suitable for casual excursions or unhurried long-distance travel. Genies, their offspring, and their servitors seem to find tusked skyfish congenial beasts of burden.
