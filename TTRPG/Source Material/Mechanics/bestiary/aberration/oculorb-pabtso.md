*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 214*  

Many oculorbs are dreamed into existence by beholders. The Far Realm's strange power can pervade a beholder's dreams, resulting in the birth of an oculorb.

Oculorbs resemble a slimy conglomeration of eyes in many sizes and shapes. They are dreaded even by the beholders that birth them. An oculorb is a tangle of negative emotions—the fury, melancholy, and obsession of its creator, all given gruesome, corporeal form. Like a beholder, an oculorb can fire beams of energy from its eyes, but an oculorb's eyes lack the more sophisticated magical nature of a beholder's eyestalks. Instead, an oculorb unleashes powerful waves of energy charged with negative emotions, cowing its foes with despair and ire.
