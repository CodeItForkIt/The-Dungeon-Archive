# [Chelicerae](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/chelicerae-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 53*  

*The massive spider stands perched on tall, stilted legs, and the disheveled body of a robed arcanist swings from its clenched mandibles.*

## Feed on Spellcasters

These massive arachnids are largely confined to great forests and occasional wastelands, although rumors persist of sightings in the dark alleys of magocratic cities, causing trepidation among the spellcasters there. Few creatures pose such a threat to spellcasters as chelicerae.

## Carry Their Prey

Walking on high, stilted legs, these creatures resemble gigantic harvesters. More often than not, they are found with the grisly bodies of humanoids dangling from their clenched mandibles.

## Cocoon Arcanists

Chelicerae stalk isolated victims, striking with a poisonous bite then pinning the victim within powerful jaws. There, the victim's helpless body can hang for days on end as the chelicerae pursues obscure and eldritch tasks. At best, victims wake up weeks later with no memory of the events, far from home, and drained of vitality and spells. Others are stored immobilized in thick cocoons in a high treetop until their body and mind recover. A few unlucky victims are slain and rise a week later as walking dead that obey and protect the chelicerae.
