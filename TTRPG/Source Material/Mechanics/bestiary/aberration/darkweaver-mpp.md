# [Darkweaver](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/darkweaver-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 25, Sigil and the Outlands, Turn of Fortune's Wheel*  

Arachnid predators of the Shadowfell, darkweavers inhabit caves, dungeons, and other dark locales throughout the multiverse, including Undersigil and the windswept darkness of Pandemonium. A darkweaver lurks in the shadows of its lair, waiting for hapless prey to pass by. When a target approaches, the darkweaver fires webs of pure shadow at its quarry, then drags the victim into the darkness.

Darkweavers are fascinated by sensations—particularly taste—and how creatures from across the planes experience reality. For them, the act of eating is an experience to be drawn out and savored, with every meal considered in all its facets. Whether its fare is a demon, an archon, a struggling halfling, or a catatonic mule, all such meals are culinary delights for a darkweaver, served up from the cosmic kitchen that is the multiverse. These spider-like terrors appreciate second-hand descriptions of sensations, especially those they're unlikely to experience in their home environment. A darkweaver's captive might delay being consumed by sharing tales of its experiences, particularly great meals, with the monster. Some might even convince a darkweaver to release them if they promise to return with rare spices or one-of-a-kind meals. Those who manage to escape a darkweaver should think twice about returning to the creature's lair, though, as darkweavers prioritize their appetites over bargains.

## A Darkweaver's Lair

Darkweavers dwell in lightless caverns, preferring locations touched by pitch-black planes, such as Pandemonium or the Shadowfell. Darkweavers tend to inhabit isolated sites where they can weave webs of shadow undisturbed.

A darkweaver encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 11 (7,200 XP).

## Darkweaver Webs

A darkweaver's web has a 50 percent chance of having `1d6` cocoons. Roll on the Darkweaver Cocoon Contents table to determine what might be inside each of these shadowy masses.
