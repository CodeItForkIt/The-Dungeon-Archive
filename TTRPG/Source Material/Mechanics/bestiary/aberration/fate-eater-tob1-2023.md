# [Fate Eater](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/fate-eater-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 168*  

*Violet radiance surrounds this large pale centipede. Its flesh is translucent, and its jaws are crystalline.*

## Destiny Destroyers

Fate eaters infest remote areas of the planes, where they consume the threads of Fate itself. The beings in charge of Fate view them as vermin. Sometimes those beings engage particularly canny planar travelers either to hunt fate eaters or to help repair the damage they've done. This can be a deadly job, as the fate eaters consider the destiny of a mortal to be the tastiest of delicacies, rich in savory possibilities.

## Planar Gossips

Fate eaters can and do trade information about various dooms, fates, and outcomes, but one must have something rich in destiny to tradeâ€”or at least, juicy gossip about gods and demons.

## Visionary Flesh

Eating the properly prepared flesh of a fate eater grants the eater insight into the fate of another being.
