# [Rift Swine](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/rift-swine-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 307*  

*This enormous pig is as large as an ox, and its mouth bristles with mismatched tusks. Its body is a lopsided mass of tumorous flesh that gives way to eyes and vestigial mouths, while long tentacles trail from its sides.*

From time to time, a breach forms in the fabric of the multiverse, and the Material Plane is bathed in the energy of alien dimensions. Living creatures exposed to this incursion can undergo horrible mutations, turning into monstrous mockeries of their former shapes. One example of this phenomenon is the rift swine: once-ordinary pigs transformed into slavering horrors after being bathed in eldritch light.

## Destructive Herds

Rift swine travel in small herds. Their effect on an area can be catastrophic—they eat nearly anything, possess a fiendish cunning, and delight in the destruction they cause. A rift swine has difficulty perceiving anything smaller than itself as a threat, leading it to attack most other creatures on sight and fighting until it is destroyed.

## Abyssal Meat

Rumors of vast herds of hundreds of rift swine on strongly chaos-aligned planes, cultivated by the lords of those places as a food source, are thankfully unconfirmed.
