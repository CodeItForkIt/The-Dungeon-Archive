# [Shoggoth](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/shoggoth-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 326*  

*The giant, gelatinous blob of flesh releases whistles, trills, and chirps as it rolls forward, forming and reabsorbing mouths, eyes, and ears across its body.*

A shoggoth is an intelligent, gelatinous blob capable of manipulating and reshaping its body. Created by an elder race as servants, the shoggoths rebelled long ago and slew their masters without pity. Since that time, they've lived in isolated or desolate regions, devouring whatever they encounter and absorbing its flesh into their own amorphous, shifting forms.

## Constant Growth

Shoggoths continue growing throughout their lives, though the eldest among them grow very slowly indeed. Some shoggoths may shrink from starvation if they deplete a territory of resources.

## Mutable Form

A shoggoth can form any number of eyes, mouths, tentacles, or other appendages as needed, though it lacks the control to take and maintain the shape of another creature.
