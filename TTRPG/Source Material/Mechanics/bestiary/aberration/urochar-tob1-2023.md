# [Urochar](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/urochar-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 374*  

*This gigantic crimson leech slithers upright on four muscular tentacles. At the top of its writhing trunk, a great lidless eye glows with baleful orange light, surrounded by quivering, feathered antennae.*

## Underworld Wanderers

Sometimes fearfully called "strangling watchers," the urochar are among the most dreaded monsters of the underworld. They have long plagued the drow, grimlocks, and other humanoids of the deep paths. They seek out death and the dying all the way to the banks of the River Styx.

## Devour the Dying

Urochars feast on the final moments of those caught in their crushing tentacles. Though powerful, urochars are quite passive. They watch the life and death struggles of other creatures and take action only to drink in a dying being's final moments from a nearby crevice or overhang.

## Immortal

Strangling watchers are effectively immortal. Gargantuan specimens in the deepest reaches of the underworld are several millennia old.

- "desc": "The urochar's body is rubbery with few bones, allowing it to easily move\

    \ turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw\
