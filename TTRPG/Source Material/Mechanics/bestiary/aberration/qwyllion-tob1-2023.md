# [Qwyllion](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/qwyllion-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 298*  

*The reeking creature resembles a toothless, cadaverous hag. Its large eyes glow with unearthly green light, and ragged claws extend from its fingers.*

## Twisted Nymphs

Qwyllion (the name means "polluter" in Old Elvish) are fey who have been twisted by the corrupted magic of magical wastelands or warped by alchemical experiments into baleful versions of their former selves.

## Frighten Animals

Besides making them hideously ugly, the transformation leaves them with a deadly gaze and the ability to control a living creature with a mere glance. Most animals can sense the corruption within the fey and refuse to approach it.

## Goblin Mercenaries

Qwyllion are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.
