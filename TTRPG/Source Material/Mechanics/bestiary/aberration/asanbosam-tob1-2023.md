# [Asanbosam](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/asanbosam-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 27*  

*A hirsute hulk with bulging, bloodshot eyes perches high in a tree, ready to seize unwary passersby with its rusty, hook-like talons.*

## Iron Hooks and Fangs

Asanbosam resemble hairy ogres from the waist up, but with muscular, flexible legs much longer than those of an ogre. These odd appendages end in feet with hook-like talons, and both the creature's hooks and its fangs are composed of iron rather than bone or other organic material. These iron fangs and claws mark an asanbosam's age, not just by their size but also by their color. The youngest specimens have shiny gray hooks and fangs, while those of the older asanbosams are discolored and rusty.

## Iron Eaters

The asanbosam diet includes iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf vegetables, and—in times of desperation—grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake their cravings. The asanbosams' taste for fresh blood and humanoid flesh led to the folklore that they are vampiric (not true).

## Tree Lairs

Asanbosams spend most of their lives in trees, where they build nestlike houses or platforms of rope and rough planks. They don't fear magic; most tribes count at least one spellcaster among its members.
