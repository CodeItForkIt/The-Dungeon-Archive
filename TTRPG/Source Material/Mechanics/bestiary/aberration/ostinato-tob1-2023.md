# [Ostinato](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/ostinato-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 292*  

*A bit of catchy, repetitive music emanates from nowhere, drifting and moving as if dancing in the empty air.*

## Born from Drama

Incredibly moving arias, passionate performances, and ditties that drive a person mad are often the product of ostinatos. These creatures of living music are born from overwrought emotions, and they feed off the vitality and personality of mortals.

## Song Searchers

Ostinatos wander the mortal world as repetitive snippets of song, searching for hosts and rich feeding grounds. They enter hosts secretly, remaining undetected to prolong their voracious feasting.

- "desc": "One Humanoid that the ostinato can see within 5 feet of it must succeed\
    \ on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the ostinato merges with the target, becoming\
    \ an enjoyable, repetitive tune in its host's mind. The ostinato can't be targeted\
    \ by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it can't attack. The host retains\
    \ control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody,\
    \ not as a living entity. The host no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the\
    \ ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. In\
    \ addition, the host has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws, and it can't maintain\
    \ [concentration](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on spells or other\
    \ effects. At the end of each long rest, the host can make a DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight))\
    \ check, realizing that the music it hears comes from an external entity on a\
    \ success.\n\nThe Aural Symbiosis lasts until the host drops to 0 hp, the ostinato\
    \ ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato is forced out by an effect like the\
    \ [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell. When\
    \ the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts out from the host's mind in a\
    \ thunderous explosion of sound, reappearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet\
    \ of the host. Each creature within 15 feet of the ostinato when it exits, including\
    \ the host, must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) thunder\
    \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The host\
    \ is immune to this ostinato's Aural Symbiosis for 24 hours after succeeding on\
    \ the saving throw or after the Aural Symbiosis ends."

    \ creatures with the same catchy tune playing in its host's mind. Each creature\
    \ within 30 feet of the ostinato's host must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw,\
    \ taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
    \ a successful one. The ostinato then gains temporary hp equal to the single highest\
    \ amount of psychic damage dealt. A [deafened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened)\
    \ creature is immune to Contagious Tune."
