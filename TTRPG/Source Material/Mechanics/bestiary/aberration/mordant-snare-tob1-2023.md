*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 276*  

*The ground rumbles and a gigantic starfish with eleven arms rises from the earth, grasping at nearby prey.*

Mordant snares were created by war mages of ancient times. Each resembles an immense, eleven-armed starfish weighing eight tons, and yet a mordant snare is never obvious. Instead, it controls a dozen humanoids shuffling about aimlessly, paying little attention to their surroundings.

## Starfish Puppet Masters

Snares bury themselves under loose soil to attack creatures walking above them. After killing a humanoid, they inject acid into the victim's body that liquefies organs and muscle while leaving the skeleton, tendons, and skin intact. With the body thus hollowed out and refilled with acid and filaments, the mordant snare can control it from below like a puppet.

## Brains Preferred

The mordant snare prefers intelligent food and hunts until an area is empty of sustenance. A village can suffer tremendous losses or even be wiped out before discovering the cause. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels, and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks a new home.

## Cooperative Killers

Mordant snares are few in number and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost long ago, eventually they will disappear. Until then, they cooperate with each other when in the same areas, using puppets to lure victims to one another.
