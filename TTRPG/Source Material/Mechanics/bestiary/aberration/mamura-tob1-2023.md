# [Mamura](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/mamura-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 263*  

*This atrocity combines the worst elements of a dead frog and a rotting fish. Its slimy, scaly, vaguely humanoid form has eyes and three clawed arms arranged radially about its body. Its green, bat-like wings seem too small to work, yet it flies well*.

## Twisted Field Sprites

Mamuras are the twisted faeries of magical wastelands and barren plains. They were once good-aligned, pixie-like fey called "polevoi," or "field sprites." At some point, they swore their souls to a dark goddess and were corrupted by her foul magic. Now they are twisted, alien things.

## Cross-Dimensional

The mamura is one degree out of phase with reality. It appears blurry and indistinct even in bright light, and it seems translucent in dim light. They babble constantly, but their talk is mostly nonsense. Their minds operate in multiple dimensions in time as well as space, and this allows them to talk to and understand creatures of the Void. Because of this, their babble may be prophetic for the few who can decipher it.

## Prophetic Followers

They occasionally align themselves with powerful goblin tribes or evil wasteland sorcerers for their own unknowable purposes.

> [!note] Mamuras in Midgard
> 
> The mamura are servants of the Black Goat of the Woods, and they live in the Wasted West and various fetid swamps and badlands. They seem friendly with the selang, and they arrange strange and orgiastic rites with them at the equinoxes.
