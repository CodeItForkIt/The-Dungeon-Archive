# [Xhkarsh](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/xhkarsh-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 400*  

*Watching with many rows of eyes, this mantis creature strikes with slashing claws and recurved barbs dripping with venom.*

## Dimensional Travelers

The clandestine xhkarsh are beings from another cosmic cycle. Their devices and armor are incomprehensible—possibly even incompatible with—creatures of this reality.

## Tamper with Fate

The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe toward their own, esoteric ends—but what those ends might be, only the xhkarsh know.

## Foes of Skein Witches

Skein witches and valkyries are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and ordinary folk.

    \ of health. These effects function even if the xhkarsh and the creature are on\

    \ (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma\
    \ saving throw or have its fate corrupted. A creature with corrupted fate has\
    \ disadvantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws, can't be targeted\
    \ by any divination magic, can't be perceived through magical scrying sensors,\
    \ and is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts.\
    \ The target's fate can be restored, ending the corruption and breaking the xhkarsh's\
    \ magical tie to the target, by a [dispel evil and good](Mechanics/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\

  "name": "Invisibility"
- "desc": "One creature whose fate is corrupted by this xhkarsh must succeed on a\
    \ DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be affected by the [geas](Mechanics/spells/geas.md)\
    \ spell for 8 hours. While under the geas, the affected creature must perform\
    \ a specific, seemingly minor task that furthers the decades-long goals of the\
    \ xhkarsh. Such a task could be writing a letter to a specific person, damaging\
    \ a seemingly random piece of equipment, or speaking a specific sentence to a\
    \ particular person. The xhkarsh can use Seize Strand on a particular creature\
    \ no more than once every 24 hours, regardless of success or failure on the saving\
    \ throw."
