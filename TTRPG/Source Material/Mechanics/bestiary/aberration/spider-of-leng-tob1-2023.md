# [Spider of Leng](Mechanics\bestiary\aberration/spider-of-leng-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 341*  

*These bloated purple spiders have small claws on their front legs that serve as handlike manipulators. Their abdomens are a sickly purple-white.*

## Hate Humanoids

The nefarious spiders of Leng are highly intelligent. They are a very ancient people, steeped in evil lore and hideous malice, with an abiding hatred for all humanoid races. They sometimes keep ghostwalk spiders as guardians or soldiers.

## Dangerous Blood

Their blood is poisonous and corrosive to most creatures native to the Material Plane. The folk of Leng prize it in the making of etheric harpoons and enchanted nets.
