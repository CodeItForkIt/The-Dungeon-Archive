- **Tool Proficiencies.** [Navigator's tools](Mechanics/items/navigators-tools.md), vehicles (space)  
- **Equipment.** A belaying pin ([club](Mechanics/items/club.md)), a set of [traveler's clothes](Mechanics/items/travelers-clothes.md), a [grappling hook](Mechanics/items/grappling-hook.md), [50 feet of hempen rope](Mechanics/items/hempen-rope-50-feet.md), and a [pouch](Mechanics/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You were raised in the void of Wildspaceâ€”home to asteroid miners, moon farmers, and other hardy folk. Perhaps you grew up in a far-flung settlement such as the Rock of Bral (described in "chapter 3"), or you spent your early years on the crew of a spelljamming ship, performing helpful chores such as swabbing the deck, loading and offloading cargo, and scraping barnacles off the hull.

Whatever your history, life in Wildspace has toughened you so well that you are as brave as a [miniature giant space hamster](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/space-hamster-bam.md) when it comes to facing the terrors and other challenges of the airless night.

## Close Encounter

You had a harrowing encounter with one of Wildspace's many terrors. You escaped with your life, but the encounter left you with a scar or two, or perhaps a recurring nightmare. Roll on the Close Encounter table to determine which creature nearly got the best of you. Creatures marked with an asterisk appear in "Boo's Astral Menagerie"; the others are described in the "Monster Manual".

## Feature: Wildspace Adaptation

You gain the [Tough feat](Mechanics/feats/tough.md) from the "Player's Handbook". In addition, you learned how to adapt to zero gravity. Being weightless doesn't give you disadvantage on any of your melee attack rolls (see ""Weightlessness"" in "chapter 2").
