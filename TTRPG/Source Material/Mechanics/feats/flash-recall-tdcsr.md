# Flash Recall
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 190*  

**Prerequisite**: Spellcasting feature from a class that prepares spells

You've developed the ability to instantly recall an unprepared spell in moments of sudden necessity.

As a bonus action, you prepare a spell of 1st level or higher from your spellbook (if you're a [wizard](Mechanics/classes/wizard.md)) or from your class spell list (if you're not a [wizard](Mechanics/classes/wizard.md)). This spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it replaces another spell of an equal or higher level that you had previously prepared.

Once you use this feat to recall a spell, you can't do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

> [!note] Rules Tip: Prepared Spells
> 
> The Flash Recall feat requires you to be a spellcaster who prepares spells. This includes classes such as [clerics](Mechanics/classes/cleric.md), [druids](Mechanics/classes/druid.md), and [paladins](Mechanics/classes/paladin.md), who prepare spells each day from their class list, and [wizards](Mechanics/classes/wizard.md), who prepare spells from a spellbook. Classes such as [bards](Mechanics/classes/bard.md) and [sorcerers](Mechanics/classes/sorcerer.md), who inherently know their spells rather than preparing them, can't benefit from this feat.
