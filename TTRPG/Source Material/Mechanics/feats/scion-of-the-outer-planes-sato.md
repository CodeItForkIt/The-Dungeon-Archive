# Scion of the Outer Planes
*Source: Sigil and the Outlands p. 12*  

**Prerequisite**:  Campaign

Your connection to an Outer Plane infuses you with the energy there. Choose a type of plane listed in the Planar Infusion table. Your choice gives you resistance to a damage type and the ability to cast a cantrip, as specified in the table. You can cast this cantrip without material components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
