**Mortuary Encounters (Levels 11—16)**

`dice: [](mortuary-encounters-levels-1116-aatm.md#^mortuary-encounters-levels-1116)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Factol Skall](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/factol-skall-aatm.md)* drifts through the Mortuary toward his orrery (detailed later in this supplement). |
| 2 | Two [guardian nagas](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/guardian-naga.md) slither up to the party. The nagas are collecting stories about those who have passed. |
| 3 | A [death tyrant](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/death-tyrant.md), eager to build its undead army, lingers outside a derelict crypt. The monster accosts any non-Undead it encounters. |
| 4 | An [arcanaloth](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth.md) testator informs the characters they much each present a copy of their last will and testament to continue their exploration. If a character doesn't have a will, the testator offers to write one for them on the spot in exchange for 10 gp each. |
| 5 | A [githyanki knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) and four pallbearers ([githyanki warriors](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md)) march toward a portal to the Astral Plane to honor a fallen comrade. The githyanki attack characters who interrupt their solemn procession but accept any who share the load as one of their own. |
| 6 | A sarcophagus-like [animated coffin](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/animated-coffin-aatm.md)* conveys a haughty [mummy lord](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord.md) to its tomb. Two [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) walk alongside the coffin. The mummy lord demands that passersby acknowledge its rule with a bow; the mummies attack all who refuse. |
| 7 | A [cadaver collector](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/cadaver-collector-mpmm.md)† emerges from a portal to Acheron, dragging a cart of corpses behind it. |
| 8 | A [deathlock mastermind](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/deathlock-mastermind-mpmm.md)† leads four [deathlocks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/deathlock-mpmm.md)† in an unholy ritual dedicated to the powers of death. To complete the ritual, the deathlocks require a living sacrifice—one of the characters would be perfect. |
| 9 | Four [minotaur skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton.md) carry a palanquin of bones supporting a hostile [skull lord](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skull-lord-mpmm.md).† |
| 10 | A [narzugon](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/narzugon-mpmm.md)† astride a [nightmare](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nightmare.md) patrols a stretch of catacombs as part of an archdevil's errand. The narzugon attacks any non-Undead, eager to add their souls to archdevil's growing collection. |
