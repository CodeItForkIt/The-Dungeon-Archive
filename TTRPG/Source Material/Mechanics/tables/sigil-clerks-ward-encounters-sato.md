`dice: [](sigil-clerks-ward-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-clerks-ward-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A cocky [bariaur wanderer](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/bariaur-wanderer-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") offers their services to the party as a tout. |
| 2 | A stiff-necked Fated tax collector ([noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)), flanked by two [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), smugly informs the characters they must each pay a "promenade toll" of 1 sp to proceed in their current direction. |
| 3 | Out of breath and clearly hiding something on their person, a teenage tiefling [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) begs the characters to help them avoid two oncoming [Harmonium peacekeepers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/harmonium-peacekeeper-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). |
| 4 | A drunk elf [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stumbles out of an onion-shaped cab pulled by a sweet and gullible [unicorn](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) named Corny. The unicorn asks the characters if they need a ride. |
| 5 | A wizened, purple-robed Incantifer ([archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) passes through the streets, eliciting nervous whispers from a crowd of onlookers. |
| 6 | A [Society of Sensation Muse](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/society-of-sensation-muse-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") dazzles the characters with a street-side performance. |
| 7 | Olga, a bookish [frost giant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md), trips before the characters as she hurries to the "Hall of Records", sending a stack of titanic papers into the air. |
| 8 | An obnoxious [equinal guardinal](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/equinal-guardinal-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") brays atop a street-side soapbox. They attempt to goad a character into a cynical debate about the future of Sigil. |
