# Boxing Lessons
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

A wise monk was happy to share the basic form of the jab and weave. When you take the [Attack](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to quickly execute two unarmed strikes against one or more creatures you could target. You may use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of these unarmed strikes. The damage die used for these unarmed strikes is the same as your Bardic Inspiration die.

At 6th level, you have finally mastered the "weave" portion of your technique. You do not provoke [attacks of opportunity](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) this turn.

At 14th level, your practice has paid off, granting you the use of a slightly ki-infused attack. When you hit with one of these attacks you may attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
