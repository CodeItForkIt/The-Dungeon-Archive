# Dark Bargain
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

> [!note]
> This is a magical effect. You made a shady bargain with a haggard warlock. When you select this option, choose a [Eldritch Invocation](Mechanics/optional-features/list-eldritch-invocation.md) from the Warlock's list of class features for which you meet the prerequisites. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to gain the benefits of this Dark Invocation for 10 minutes. Doing this requires you to roll your Bardic Inspiration die and take an amount of necrotic damage equal to the roll.

At 6th level, you have learned how to deepen your pact with the warlock you once met. You may choose to take double the necrotic damage you rolled on your Bardic Inspiration die to instead have the effect last for 1 hour.

At 14th level, your pact with the warlock unlocks frightening new power. When you reach 14th level, choose a single spell of 7th level or lower from the warlock's spell list. You may cast the spell once during this effect without expending any spell slots, although you must cast it at the level of your highest spell slot. In exchange, the spell deals additional necrotic damage to you equal to twice the level at which it was cast.
