# Evocation Lessons
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

> [!note]
> This is a magical effect. A venerable wizard shared secrets of evocation magic with you. When you select this option, choose a damage-dealing spell you can cast. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration when you cast this spell to change the type of damage it deals to your choice of either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder (chosen when you cast the spell). Add the number you roll on your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) to the damage dealt by the spell.

At 6th level you may choose to change the spell you had previously selected with this feature to another spell that you know.

At 14th level you may choose to change the spell you had previously selected with this feature to another spell that you know.
