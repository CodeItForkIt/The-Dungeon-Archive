# Bind the Wound
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

An experienced paladin instructed you in the basics of combat triage. When you or an ally within 5 feet of you receives healing of any kind, you may use your reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and provide extra healing equal to the number on the Bardic Inspiration die roll + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You must have at least one hand free in order to quickly staunch the target's wound.

At 6th level, you have learned to identify a selection of useful herbs that you can carry with you. When providing additional healing with this trick you may also remove the poisoned or paralyzed condition from the target.

At 14th level, you have developed a true knack for emergency triage. You may additionally remove a single disease affecting the target of this ability.
