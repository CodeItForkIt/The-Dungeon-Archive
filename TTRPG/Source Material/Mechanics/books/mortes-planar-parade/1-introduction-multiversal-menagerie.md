Planar travelers often find [mimirs](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) invaluable in learning about reality and avoiding doom at the hands, claws, fangs, tentacles, proboscises, ovipositors, and other appendages of the multiverse's countless predatory and lethally grumpy inhabitants.

![Creatures from every corne...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/MPP/000-00-001.sigil-busy.webp#center "Creatures from every corner of the multiverse crowd Sigil's busy streets")

[Morte](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/morte-tofw.md), however, isn't a [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md).

A floating skull with a penchant for speaking his mind and claiming expertise, Morte is one of Sigil's many unique inhabitants and an accomplished explorer of the planes. For the right amount of coin or a future favor, Morte is quick to offer his advice, insights, and commentary on the many inhabitants of the planes. This book contains useful data gleaned from Morte's stories and ramblings. Still, the planes are vast and varied, and what Morte experienced as true might not match all circumstances. Reader beware.

## Using a Stat Block

This book is a companion to the "Monster Manual" and uses a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the "introduction" of the "Monster Manual" before proceeding. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.

The "Stat Blocks by Challenge Rating table" sorts the creatures in this book by challenge rating. Most of these creatures appear in the ""Bestiary A to Z"" section, but those marked with an asterisk (*) appear in the ""Faction Agents"" section.

### Unusual Attacks and Magic

Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.

### Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites

If a stat block contains the name of a class in parentheses under the creature's name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

![Sunflies influenced by var...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/MPP/001-00-002.sunfly-side.webp#center "Sunflies influenced by various Outer Planes inhabit every corner of the Outlands")

![Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites; Stat Blocks by Challenge Rating](Mechanics/tables/meeting-magic-item-prerequisites-stat-blocks-by-challenge-rating-mpp.md)

## Petitioners

Petitioners are former mortals. They've lived, ceased living, and now exist on the Outer Planes. They typically inhabit a plane that shares their alignment or the realm of a deity they worship. Some, however, become lost and wander the planes or make new homes for themselves elsewhere on the Great Wheel.

You can make any creature that isn't a Celestial or Fiend a petitioner by giving it the following traits:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Plane Locked.** The creature's creature type changes to Celestial or Fiend (DM's choice), and the creature can't leave the Outer Planes. Portals or magic that allow transport beyond the Outer Planes don't affect this creature.
> 
> **Soul Shape.** A dead petitioner can be returned to life only by the [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell or the [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell. If affected by these spells, a petitioner chooses whether to return in its original mortal form or as a petitioner.
^005

### Death and the Planes

Mortals that die eventually have their souls return as petitioners in far-flung reaches of the Outer Planes. There, they manifest as idealized versions of themselves. These forms might be similar to the forms they had in life or be those of entirely different creatures. A petitioner or another Celestial or Fiend that is destroyed can reconstitute on a plane that shares its alignment after 100 years, or it might choose to become one with that plane and never return. A creature that re-forms on the planes multiple times becomes increasingly dissimilar from its original mortal form.

## Planar Influences

The Outer Planes are home to powerful forces of good and evil, chaos and order. Over time, these forces can alter creatures exposed to them. Due to their proximity to the Outer Planes, the inhabitants of the Outlands' gate-towns and nearby regions often exhibit traits associated with specific Outer Planes. Creatures might also have such traits if they dwell in other realms steeped in the energy of an Outer Plane—whether such a place be in the Outlands, on the Material Plane, or elsewhere.

This section provides customization options for creatures exposed to the energies of the Outer Planes for months or years. Creatures influenced by a plane can have as many or as few of these traits as you choose.

> [!quote] A quote from Morte  
> 
> "Anything you think you know about critters from the Material Plane doesn't apply in the Outlands, Chief. Your dog back home ain't nothing like a hound from the Nine Hells or Mount Celestia. Only thing those planar sorts have in common is that neither wants to hear about how you're 'totally a dog person.'"

### Planar Alignment

In addition to the plane-specific traits you can grant a creature, the influence of a plane changes a creature's alignment to match the plane's alignment, as shown on the Outer Plane Alignments table. If a plane a creature is influenced by has more than one alignment, you choose the creature's alignment from the options listed.

![Planar Alignment; Outer Plane Alignments](Mechanics/tables/planar-alignment-outer-plane-alignments-mpp.md)

### The Abyss

Creatures influenced by the Abyss gain demonic features, such as horns, scales, and black blood. A creature influenced by the Abyss also gains one or more of following traits of your choice:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Entropy of the Abyss.** Whenever the creature deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it can change the damage type to necrotic.
> 
> **Poison Tolerant.** The creature has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition on itself.
> 
> **Siege Monster.** The creature deals double damage to objects and structures.
^00c

### Acheron

Creatures influenced by Acheron have rough, scarred skin that resembles armor or pitted metal. A creature influenced by Acheron also gains one or more of following traits of your choice:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Battle Lust.** Whenever the creature reduces another creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it gains 10 "temporary hit points", and it can take a bonus action to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
> 
> **Corrosive Death.** When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it turns into a pile of rust. Any equipment it was wearing or carrying is unaffected.
> 
> **Pack Tactics.** The creature has advantage on an attack roll against a target if at least one of the creature's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally doesn't have the [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.
^011

> 
> **Unshakable Resolve.** An invisible, magical aura of confidence and hope surrounds the creature. When another creature that has the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition starts its turn within 5 feet of the creature, the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition affecting it is suppressed for 1 minute. When this suppression ends, the condition resumes if its duration hasn't expired.
^01a

### The Beastlands

Creatures influenced by the Beastlands gain wilder or more animalistic features, such as larger eyes, thicker fur, or more prominent canine teeth. Beasts influenced by the Beastlands are often affected per the [awaken](Mechanics/spells/awaken.md) spell—though normal Beasts also typically range through these areas in large numbers. A creature influenced by the Beastlands also gains one or more of following traits of your choice:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Speech of Beast and Leaf (Requires the Ability to Speak at Least One Language).** This creature can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts and Plants.

^023

### Carceri

Creatures influenced by Carceri appear as if they'd been imprisoned underground for a long period; their hair is matted, their nails or claws are long and dirty, and they have marks as if they were bound by chains or rope. A creature influenced by Carceri also gains one or more of following traits of your choice:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Burden of Hopelessness.** An invisible, magical aura of hopelessness surrounds the creature. Any other creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the creature has its speed reduced by 10 feet until it is reduced to 0 hit points, regains hit points, or gains "temporary hit points". This reduction never exceeds 10 feet.
> 
> **Torturous Teleport.** An invisible, magic-disrupting aura surrounds the creature. Any creature that teleports into or out of a space within 20 feet of the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (`3d10`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
^027

> 
> **Churning Chaos.** When the creature scores a critical hit or takes a critical hit, chaotic energy bursts from the creature, creating one the following effects (choose one or roll a `d6`):
> 
> - **1–2.** Melting Terrain. For 1 minute, the ground within 20 feet of the creature melts into a mud-like texture, becoming "difficult terrain".  
> - **3–4.** Miraculous Resilience. This creature gains "temporary hit points" equal to half the damage the critical hit dealt (rounded up).  
> - **5–6.** Disrupted Gravity. Each creature within 20 feet of the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or rise vertically, up to 20 feet, and remain magically suspended there for 1 minute. While suspended in this way, a creature has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.  
>

If you're planning to visit one of the Outer Planes, best to keep your stay short–if you ever want to leave at all."

### Pandemonium

A creature influenced by Pandemonium appears as though it were exposed to cold air for a long time, its skin dry and cracked. Its hair might blow in a phantom wind. A creature influenced by Pandemonium also gains one or more of following traits of your choice:

The creature can't use this trait while it has the [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.
^04e

## Denizens of the Outlands

As the Outlands are the crossroads of the Outer Planes, travelers in that realm might encounter any creature in existence, many of which have been influenced by other planes. The following sections detail the various creature types likely to be encountered in the Outlands. Use the tables in these sections to inspire encounters and whole adventures in the Outlands.

> [!note] 
> 
> Planar Exemplars
> 
> Some creatures originate on specific Outer Planes. Just as flesh and blood are fundamental to many creatures from the Material Plane, the forces of these creatures' home planes are fundamental to their being. These creatures are manifestations of a plane itself and are altered by other planar influences only under unusual circumstances. The archons of Mount Celestia, the demons of the Abyss, the devils of the Nine Hells, the modrons of Mechanus, and the slaadi of Limbo are just a few examples of such children of the planes.
> 
> As a result, it's rare to encounter a group of modrons embracing the chaos of Limbo or devils awash in the natural energy of the Beastlands. It's up to you to decide what creatures are exemplars of their home planes and under what circumstances they might be influenced by other planes.
^052

### Aberrations

With their inscrutable biologies and agendas, Aberrations might journey to the Outlands pursuing all manner of schemes or sustenance. Slaadi from Limbo are among the most common Aberrations found on the Outlands.

![Outlands Aberrations](Mechanics/tables/outlands-aberrations-mpp.md)

### Beasts

Varied Beasts roam the Outlands, with many species being long extinct on Material Plane worlds. Plane-influenced creatures and gigantic or idealized animals from the Beastlands are common.

![Outlands Beasts](Mechanics/tables/outlands-beasts-mpp.md)

### Celestials

Various Celestials watch over the Outlands, particularly those reaches that border the Upper Planes. Angels and "archons" (presented later in this book) are particularly common. Some seek to prevent fiendish incursions into the plane, while others try to align the Outlands closer to goodly philosophies.

![Outlands Celestials](Mechanics/tables/outlands-celestials-mpp.md)

### Constructs

Constructs in the Outlands might be the remnants of forgotten civilizations, servants of plane-walking magic-users, or creations with varied important or ridiculous purposes. Among the most common are modrons, mechanical denizens of Mechanus that seek to enforce order on the plane.

![Outlands Constructs](Mechanics/tables/outlands-constructs-mpp.md)

![Mechanical dinosaurs roam ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/MPP/006-00-007.mechanus-dinosaurs.webp#center "Mechanical dinosaurs roam an orderly realm influenced by the lawful energies of Mechanus")

### Dragons

All varieties of Dragons can be found in the Outlands, though many dwell in isolated reaches away from the plane's gate-towns. Some remain aloof due to their territorial natures, while others seek to avoid the "Mausoleum of Chronepsis", home to the legendary dragon Chronepsis (see "Sigil and the Outlands" for details).

![Outlands Dragons](Mechanics/tables/outlands-dragons-mpp.md)

### Elementals

Elementals of all varieties can be found in the Outlands. Mephits are common and often serve more powerful creatures as messengers.

![Outlands Elementals](Mechanics/tables/outlands-elementals-mpp.md)

### Fey

Being close to nature—even the surreal nature of the Outer Planes—Fey dwelling in the Outlands are often influenced by other planes. Fey encountered near a gate-town typically exhibit influences from the town's associated Outer Plane.

![Outlands Fey](Mechanics/tables/outlands-fey-mpp.md)

### Fiends

Denizens of the Lower Planes regularly invade the Outlands, seeking to shift the balance of the realm toward evil. The Blood War, the endless conflict between demons and devils, regularly spills onto the plane and can devastate whole regions.

![Outlands Fiends](Mechanics/tables/outlands-fiends-mpp.md)

### Giants

Giants are common in the Outlands. Many gravitate toward regions influenced by planes corresponding with their alignments, but others seek to find the "secret realm" of the giant god Annam (see "Sigil and the Outlands" for details).

![Outlands Giants](Mechanics/tables/outlands-giants-mpp.md)

### Humanoids

Humanoids from across the planes travel the Outlands and number among the most common inhabitants of the gate-towns.

![Outlands Humanoids](Mechanics/tables/outlands-humanoids-mpp.md)

### Monstrosities

Monstrosities are common in the Outlands. Due to the influence of the Outer Planes, many behave differently than they might on the Material Plane.

![Outlands Monstrosities](Mechanics/tables/outlands-monstrosities-mpp.md)

### Oozes

Oozes often appear in swampy or subterranean reaches of the Outlands or in regions influenced by the Lower Planes.

![Outlands Oozes](Mechanics/tables/outlands-oozes-mpp.md)

![In a landscape warped by L...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/MPP/007-00-008.limbo-madness.webp#center "In a landscape warped by Limbo's pure chaos, an animal-headed ettin fights a massive, many-eyed ooze")

### Plants

Plants in the Outlands often grow to incredible size, produce remarkable flowers or fruit, and exhibit bizarre shapes and colors. Regions influenced by other planes are typically first recognizable by the effect those planes have on vegetation.

![Outlands Plants](Mechanics/tables/outlands-plants-mpp.md)

### Undead

Undead often lurk in the dismal reaches of the Outlands, but some wander the land, either seeking places to spend eternity or preying on the living.

![Outlands Undead](Mechanics/tables/outlands-undead-mpp.md)

> [!quote] A quote from Morte  
> 
> "Some folks have notions about what sorts of creatures they don't expect to see around the Outer Planes. Like undead, for example–as if they can't grok how souls and vampires and zombies might all wind up on the same infinite planes. What can I say? The planes are wild, Chief–I'm unliving proof."

## Planar Encounters

The following tables present random encounters adventurers might face across the Outlands or in other realms influenced by the Outer Planes. These tables are divided by the alignment of the planes affecting a region. Unless otherwise noted, creatures marked with an asterisk (*) appear in this book, while the rest are described in the "Monster Manual".

If you wish to further customize these encounters, use traits detailed in the ""Planar Influences"" section.
