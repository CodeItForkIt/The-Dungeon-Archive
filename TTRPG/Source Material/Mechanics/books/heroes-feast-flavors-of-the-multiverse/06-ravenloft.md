# Ravenloft
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 123* 

CRASH LANDING! Without a proper pilot, our heroes crash land the SPELLJAMMER in foreboding BAROVIA! Grieving their lost friends, they seek to finish their mission and deliver the poisoned wine, Veneno '18, to a mysterious patron who lives in ominous CASTLE RAVENLOFT!

> 
> Disaster! The spelljammer, CRASHÈD near unknown woods! Dint's last squeaking command was that we abscond with the Veneno '18 and deliver it to the Castle Ravenloft!
> 
> We scream into the night and slink through misty shadows, wailing with every guiltmuddèd stride. In my quavering fingers, I hold chippèd RUBY, coughèd up there by dying Dint!
> 
> You see, we killed him! Only now do I understand. As the Veneno '18 poisoned sweet Bri'An, we too poisoned doughty Dint by pretending that Ruby, sweet Ruby, was the "Jewel of Javanium." (T'ever that 'tis!) As we devour beefs, so too did Dint consume gems for nourishment! He died, poisoned, believing we were some honest band of adventurers known as the Quaternate Tetrad. Even as he thrashed in pained throes, he urged us forward to present ourselves to the Ravenloft patron and earn FIVE ASTRAL DIAMONDS.
> 
> My heart bleats in my ears as I lead my false Tetrad in flight: We scream unto the night!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> After like an hour of screaming through the woods, I gained enough sense to pull myself together and slap Squirladax to non-screaming. I'm now pouring the local "Blood Meal" into his nose, which the manual suggests is the quickest way to restore warm blood directly to his brain.
>

> 
> Composure regained, I find Dint's murder...somewhat less fascinating now. I find this place, however, more appetizing. We are in a tavern called Blood on the Vine that is buried in the mist-shrouded village of "Barovia."
> 
> Barovia—a place of soulless eyes that both haunt and compel me.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> At the tavern, I hunt HFFotM. I slay Fig Cakes with sharpened daggers o' the mouth. Sasha crunches Tavern Crickets. Oh, the leaps she'll make with cricket digestions greasing her leg hinges, so sayeth Volo's book.
> 
> Buoyed by Purple Grapemash No. 3, I realize Dint's memory must be honorèd. A false Tetrad playèd by a true triad will win the day! And Five Astral Diamonds they'll pay!
> 
> Amazing what a sauced paunch can do for morale. Veneno '18 in hand, I will now ask the taverneer what direction lies this friendly Castle Ravenloft!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Ugh, cursed reader! We now need to calm our "leader" Squirladax who fled the tavern wailing, after a misconstrued report from the tavern keeper.
> 
> Let me explain: The tavern host gnashed his teeth and brought fear to Squirladax's flapping ears with his words: "Castle Ravenloft is home to Strahd. The first Vampyr."
> 
> Upon hearing this, a'course, our little goblin man ran through the streets, screaming, "Vampeeeeer! Vampeeeer! We all die this night!"
> 
> How embarrassed 'twas he when I imparted to him of my superior knowledge of Shadow's Edge-ducation. (You see, in my studies with the Lords of Shadow's Edge, dark infernal worlds and secrets of the damned were revealed to me.)
> 
> I soothed fearful Squirladax that Vampeers is nothing to be a panic of. VamPIRES, to be sure! But Vampeers are simply contemporaries of equivalent stature and station as Vampires. For 'twere a Vampire to, say, be brought before a jury's court, the judgment would'st fall upon the vampire's Vampeers.
> 
> This calmed Squirladax; and cursèd goblin, he took the lead again.
> 
> His ignorance is astonishing.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> Oh, my breath bellows! We finally arrived at the top of the road, high above the moonlit countryside. Full moon, so that's creepy.... As was that wolf we passed that wore—I swear it was trousers? Chaps? Weird. Scary.... Sad. I've beat up my friends, lied, cheated, let another friend die, and applied my leeches under my eyes to suck my tears away. We now cross a drawbridge to the fog-swirled turrets of Castle Ravenloft.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> The silence of your home is welcome, Strahd—absent as it is from the bothersome chit chat of servants. These chambers of black and purple are quiet as death. Were you expecting me? Will you entice me to betray my companions and send their dead souls to satisfy my Queen? What do you offer?
> 
> Oh—this prodigious feasting table that welcomes us! HFFotM at one end, Two Hares Inn Rabbit Stew at the other. Baskets of Green Onion Pancakes and plates piled high with the sausages and potatoes of Quij's Plate. Carafes of HFFotM towered above the rest! And in the marbled center, a space, no doubt, for the main course still to come! At the room's edge, there is a magnificent, gilded pipe organ, and behold on the opposite wall is a lavish portrait.... My new friend? Enemy? You are rather dashing, and I want to set your face aflame.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> I watch as pallid, lanky, hairless men with idiot grins appear and perch themselves around us at the table. Eight in number, all of them silent smirking, and I do think, haughtily, at me. Do these **strangers**, conspiring to share a private jest, mean to belittle ME?! How dare?!
> 
> Oh wait...
> 
> While I have not trained under Lords of some fancy academy like Deelia, my memory jogs, and I now understand! These contemptible imbeciles are the deceased of humans oft referred to as "skeletons!" I do not know why these dead humans insist on smirking at me, though. What know'st they?
> 
> They must know that I am a murderer. My knees knock.
> 
> The walls groan, and a dust-encrusted, man-sized box is wheeled in by yet more condescending skeletons!
> 
> A ghostly voice emanates from lipless teeth. "Behold. He is Chahd." And the lid to what I now know is a coffin creaks open. I believe we are soon to meet our host.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> I report this from the water closet. Art thou yanking my leg? CHAHD?! Clambering clumsily from stupid coffin, highcollared velveteen cape, a plaster of yellow-moldy hair framing his round stupid face. I recognized him in an instant and hid to avoid his eyes.
> 
> Reader! Let Deelia blow thy wig bald.
> 
> He is NOT Chahd, nor Strahd! He is not vampire! This so-called Chahd is in reality CHAD, my old ally, turned nemesis. 'Twas HE that alerted the Lords of Shadow's Edge to exile me after a meager incident allegedly involving a small amount of purifying flame.
> 
> I must play my part, return to the banquet coolly, and challenge Chad's Vampyrity, for I doubt very much any vampire would see Chahd as peer.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> We were feasting mirthfully, when—Chahd bellowed: "I AM VAMPIRE!" This caused a soiling of the pants of my very soul, when Deelia called out hence:
> 
> "You are neither Vampire, nor Vampeer, nor Chahd, but Chad! Where is the Lord of this Manor?"
> 
> Chahd bit back viciously. "He is gone afar for the weekend. A vacuum is left in this his house, his seat of power! And I am the sitter of this house!"
> 
> I retorted, "So your authority here is borrowed, not bought of wealth or influence?"
> 
> Chahd grinned evilly. "I have found a means of pyr review. Of buying my master's favor, my sweet Quaternate Tetrad." He gesticulated to the Veneno '18 and bade us drink deeply from it, for that 'twas its purpose all along!
> 
> "WELCOME TO MY MASTER'S BANQUET. FOR YOU SEE, YOU...ARE THE INGREDIENTS!"
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> I DON'T GET ANYTHING! I WANNA GO HOME! Ok.... Sorry! First, I don't get why Deelia didn't just burn the hell out of Chahd, magicwise, but Chahd started calling her "Fire Fingers" and Deelia got something called "vexed!" The skeletons start pulling out GIANT CLEAVERS! I look to Squirladax, and he's crying into that stupid Ruby....
> 
> Okay, so it's on me. Let's try to flip this table like they do in stage plays! Nope, it's too big. Then I started smashing plates, but no one cared. Wait! I'll bet that big expensive pipe organ would get Chahd in trouble if it were broken! So, I hurl my chair at it, and yeah! BOOM!! And SURPRISE...it shuddered and slid to reveal a FREAKING SECRET DOOR!
> 
> So that's when I smashed Chahd in the face with the Veneno and grabbed my friends. We ran like the wind!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> We flee into the eternal Barovian night and make it to the calamitous site beyond the woods where the spelljammer crashed. I can only guess, out of fear and madness, that we had some hope Dint would rise from his grave and whisk us and the spelljammer into the sky and to safety.
> 
> But then I remember . . BETRAYED! Dastardly Dint bade us deliver ourselves up to be eaten! Nary an Astral Diamond to be found! Now, out of the Svalich Woods, march the hungry skeletal minions of Vampeer housesitter, Chahd.
> 
> I sign off...from this life and deem this the final entry of the BUREAU OF DARK TABLES. TPK.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> The skeletons will be here soon. Goodbye cruel universe, and hello to oblivion, as it is clear that I have not curried enough favor with the Queen to join her...in the Shadowfell.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)

> I am now super sad that I spent all my money on food instead of, like, a new battleaxe.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> Boy, skeletons truly do march a snail's pace, do they not? With every step, however, my throat constricts, as I know this to be the end of all things. I see Chahd. He will drain my goblin blood. My death will be beyond all reasoning excruciation. 'Tis what I deserve. FIN.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)

> So did'st Bri'An, son of Stev'An find himself the lone vanguard against the skeletal hordes. And Bri'An's friends begged weepily that Bri'An might perform a TURNING OF THE UNDEAD.

## Halfling Iron Rations

Braving the dead wastes of the Shadowfell demands great preparation and fortitude. The endless gloom is unforgiving and yields little in the way of natural edible resources. Travelers would be wise to foreplan their meals and carry all required consumables with them. The iron rations prepared by Gloomwrought's surprisingly sizable halfling population are a notable and cost-effective trail treat. This creative medley of crushed nuts, local oats, and crunchy seeds are clumped into tiny balls and cemented with honey. And they are as packed with nutrients as they are yummy. Even when you're not embarking on an arduous, despair-filled journey, this granola makes for a nourishing, delectable snack that balances the sweet and savory.

## Tavern Crickets

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/106_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

There is an old phrase popular among the dwellers of the Shadowfell: "Choice is for the spoilt." Perhaps that idiom is the origin of this modest and practical insect-based recipe that dates back centuries and speaks to the ingenuity of the plane's original inhabitants. Adult crickets are flash-fried, air-dried, and then seasoned with an assortment of aromatics, including chile, lime, and cayenne, and are served by the dozen in a large rolled-leaf "cone." As popular in the Material Plane of Faerûn as they are in the Shadowfell, tavern crickets are a crunchy, irresistibly tangy, protein-packed snack that can brighten the otherwise dismal days spent in the region.

## Barovian Garlic Bread

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/107_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

This buttery bread, served in both loaf and knot form, is ever-present in the taverns and inns dotting the misty (and eerie) Barovian countryside. While it's not uncommon for wayward travelers to get the cold shoulder from reclusive and suspicious denizens, inns such as the Blue Water will at least offer a warm basket of this local treat to well-mannered and paying patrons. It is important to note that although garlic is a flavorful and inspired touch, it is not indigenous to the region. You'll find this pungent bread pairs nicely with a main of medium-rare wolf steak and a glass of Wizard of Wines' Champagne du le Stomp or Red Dragon Crush, but avoid the Purple Grapemash No. 3 at all costs.

## Green Onion Pancakes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/108_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

When the great floating enclaves of the Netheril Empire came crashing down, so, too, did their culinary secrets. But one community survived by escaping to the Shadowfell, and with it one of their most prized recipes was preserved: Green Onion Pancakes. While the Netherese, now known as the shadowstuff-infused Shadovar, have changed much over the centuries, this spectacular dish hasn't. These allium-based pancakes are an inexpensive and unexpectedly filling treat that pairs easily with savory roast meats. They're also delicious served solo, when dolloped with fresh cream and pureed fig spread for a uniquely Netherese experience. In many regions, scallions are an equally acceptable base vegetable that offers a pancake with a milder flavor. Regardless of how one chooses to consume this pan-fried appetizer, the culinary experience is one of the few good reasons to come to the Shadowfell.

## Two Hares Inn Rabbit Stew

It should come as no surprise that the signature dish of the Two Hares Inn, located on the zombie-infested Barovian island of Sourange, is a rabbit stew prepared with one of the region's many famous wines. What's more surprising is who makes it, for it is said about the proprietor and chef that even death "hasn't interfered with his talent." It's a classic example of not wanting to know how the sausage, or in this case, stew—a delicious medley infused with intricate notes of thyme, oregano, and dry white wine—is made. In regions where rabbit isn't available, chicken has become a popular (and, in many cases, preferred) substitute. Whichever protein you cook, it is sure to reanimate your taste buds.

## Whole Roast Boar

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/110_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Whole roast boar, or some parts thereof, is a favorite at the banquets of vampire hosts throughout the Domains of Dread. It is rumored that hosts wait until their guests are "glassy of eye, greasy of chin, and a drowsy cheer has come upon them" to insert a single fang to the jugular of each guest and exsanguinate to their taste. Proper preparation requires of the cook an unabashed love of jam, port, and brown sugar, applied with a heavy hand to flavor the meat, ensuring that you and your guests will leave nothing on your plates. For those lucky travelers fortunate enough to escape the fog-shrouded confines of Barovia to Toril, a variation of this hearty and succulent feast is a specialty of the Boar with Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold, which sometimes uses pork when a boar cannot be procured and is often served with a dry ruby wine from Cormyr.

## Quij's Plate

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/113_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Quij's Plate, consisting of pan-fried sausage, twice-browned potatoes, and eggs, is a filling meal that infallibly populates the menus of countless caravan cooks. Easy to prepare on the road for large parties, it has also become a popular dish in the military for its simplicity and heartiness to help soldiers brave the endless grey days. Named after an orc henchman of Lord Robilar, who inventively cooked this sausage meal for his adventuring party, using his shield for a skillet, Quij's Plate would eventually earn its place on the menu of the famed Green Dragon Inn, nestled in the Free City of Greyhawk's bustling River Quarter. The unusual name has since become the catch-all term for the countless iterations of this sausage-and-potato-based campfire classic, including those that migrated to misty Barovia via lost and hungry adventurers.

## Fig Cakes

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/115_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Fig cakes are an easily preserved pouch snack for explorers with a sweet tooth. A perfect fig cake is as much about the fig as it is about the lightly toasted and ground almonds that form this fruity confection's chewy base. While honeyed fig tarts were extremely popular in Calimshan on the planet Toril, it is believed that this unique dessert originally hailed from the desolate wastes of the Shadowfell. Developed by the elves native to the Plane of Shadow called the Shadar-Kai, these treats are sweet enough to be at home even in the dreamy Feywild. In addition to the sesame seeds and anise seeds, a strong brandy is often infused into the mix, to both sweeten and fortify these small pressed cakes. While fig cakes do not come cheap, they are, nonetheless, a proud (and delicious) reminder of the resourcefulness of the Shadar-Kai.

## Honey Milk

Frequently enjoyed by the Shadovar as a nightcap or a light dessert, honey milk is traditionally a stand-alone beverage that can be served chilled, warm, or even as toddy, spiked with herbal liqueur (as it is frequently done in the Shadowfell's forsaken city of Gloomwrought). While the preparation of honey milk is quite simple, the best versions balance a modest amount of honey with the freshest dairy (often imported from the Prime Material Plane) to produce a hearty yet refreshing drink served to all ages. However, the true key to properly preparing honey milk is patience. Traditionally, shadovar alchemists allow the mixture to marinate and cool for several hours before serving, and often include a garnish of cinnamon or citrus to make an attractive presentation for this lovely libation. Its elixir-like qualities are whispered to be good on the gut.

## Purple Grapemash No. 3

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/118_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Barovia is known for many things, its wine among them. The Wizard of Wines Vineyard is legendary for producing some of the finest wines throughout the planes and multiverse, such as the full-bodied Red Dragon Crush and the crisp Champagne du le Stomp. But not all wines that emerge from the mists of Barovia are of equal quality, as evidenced by the existence of Purple Grapemash No. 3. Priced at only three copper pieces per pint at most local taverns and other Domains of Dread, this table wine is known to be spectacularly unremarkable. However, in some areas of the Shadowfell, clever mixologists have added copious amounts of ice and lime juice to the pungent grape-ish mix, turning this otherwise mediocre concoction into a refreshing, slushy treat worth at least four copper pieces anywhere.
