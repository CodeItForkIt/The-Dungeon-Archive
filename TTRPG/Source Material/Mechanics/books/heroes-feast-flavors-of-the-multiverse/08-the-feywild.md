# The Feywild
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 181* 

TIME TO MAKE A STAND! Utilizing the astral gateways of Sigil, and pursued by CHAHD'S SKELETAL HORDES, our heroes retreat to THE FEYWILD to finally confront the villainous VAMPEER!

> 
> If only a proper plan might spring from mine head-guts! Fleeing this City of Doors in terrorstricken cowardice, we spring forth through the door once, only to spring backwards twice! A sandy hellscape! Door! A kingdom under the sea! And but always one door behind us, slender, pallid, skinless fiends sneering their death-mask smirks that nearly cry out from lipless teeth, "We know your idiocy!"
> 
> Skeletons. With their diabolical sarcastic grins! And always, a velveteen capèd incubus with pasted yellow hair. Chahd, the Betrayer. Vampyr. Zounds! We must find a place to hide!
> 
> Alas, my senses are assailed by cheery, cherry mists, flitting faerie feathers, and sweet winds that do breeze from welcoming vanilla skies. I have found the place I seek, and hence proclaimed unto my charge:
> 
> "Friends! Behold the Feywild! Brightest twin to darkest Shadowfell. 'Tis here that Chahd and his undead minions will be weakest. 'Tis here, we will make our final stand."
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> Tyr protect our flight, for in twinkling twilight, Dint's stubby, creaking legs lose pace with us. And as I fall back to assist, I fall back into shifty old Bri'An. True Bri'An, the one who wonders to himself why he bothers to talk this crappy, pious cleric talk. The one who notices the others are several paces ahead. The one who should break open Dint's bronze paunch, steal back his jewels, and be off before all is dead. And yet I don't do it.
> 
> Dint snorts unhappily.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Dint.webp#center)
> 
> My clockwork ticks with the tockings of bitterness. As I am not designed to resolve gnomish emotions, I find this tocking distressing.
> 
> My business is ruined. My ticks and tocks want only of return...to my ruined spellship Dashor.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Morning comes, and I sup upon Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup from this nameless eladrin inn we have sheltered in. The others are mortuarily quiet. I find my ears longing for the blubbering prattle that regularly sparks my contempt.
> 
> Gaze I now through the window at a nearby hill, the ruined stump of an elven guard tower atop its peak. I think mournfully of Shadow's Edge.
> 
> I have been to the afterlife, the Queen's Shadowfell, and this I know now to be a defect of that sublimely dreary place. Ne'er did I see a proper roadhouse! A place of feastings and...I don't know...dancing and merriment...for the Shadowfell I visited 'tis kind of a dump.
> 
> Roadhouse, yes. You are the peace that could be born of a Shadow's Edge Cheflord.
> 
> Of which I am not.
> 
> Soon, Chahd's icy fingers will surely choke these warm thoughts from my soul.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> WOULD MY LIFE A BOOK, ALL CHAPTERS 'ERE BE NAMÈD "BETRAYED!" For it turns out that Bri'An 'twere NEVER ANY CLERIC OF TYR! Thief and scoundrel, patriarch of lies! Yet, even now, HE plays the card of SUFFERER, with weeping quiver upon the plates of his lying mouth-hole!
> 
> From Sasha's eyes came a waterfall of tears, slipping her leech children off their ancestral cheek. She looked down yet always up to the stocky false Bri'An!
> 
> OH, 'TIS GETS WORSE!
> 
> For even as I write this, DINT now chimes with a glockenspiel of disloyalty!
> 
> TAKE THIS I CANNOT!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> EVERYTHING GOES TO HELLS! Squirladax litigates a case for solidarity, but without his powdered mop-wig, the poor goblin's legal authority is robbed of him! As Bri'An's confessions of faithlessness slip a dagger into our ribs, the Otter Gnome slits our throats with a clanging RESIGNATION OF MEMBERSHIP from our Dark Tables!
> 
> In a mighty roar that scattered HFFotM upon the inn's polished floors, Squirladax howled thusly, "Returned thee, I see, to your Arch-Nemesis ways, have you?!"
> 
> Dint choked dispassionately, "Death is certain for this Bureau. No logic nor assistance can I grant. I will return to Dashor now."
> 
> "And what of precious, sparkling Diamonds?" wheezed Squirladax
> 
> Dint puffed, "There are no Diamonds."
> 
> A shock befell all.
> 
> Kettled rage boiled in Squirladax, "KEEP YOUR DIAMONDS, MASTER OF TREASON! I will have no more sight of you!" And Squirladax fled to the outhouse to mourn.
> 
> A quiet sadness. Bri'An, his scales soggy, fell to the bench.
> 
> Then Sasha, ashen and saddest of all, laid buttery hand to Dint's bronze pauldron.
> 
> Whispered she, "You only ever helped us, and as you return to your home, the lands where Otters and Gnomes live in harmony, know that, for you, there will always be treason in my heart."
> 
> Dint is gone.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> Chahd is coming. Squirladax has not left the outhouse since yesterday. Deelia's been downing bottles of Saerloonian Glowfire at the inn. As I wander the grounds near the hill, I see Bri'An in the ruined tower gazing afar.
> 
> If Squirladax believes Dint is junk and Bri'An is garbage, then what am I? I am a fraud. Just like Bri'An. I've read *Volo's Guide* so hard...sauced my limbs, bled myself dizzy, expanded my breath bellows to near popping, and raised a colony of leeches on my face...but I am no closer to becoming the warrior Squirladax needs.
> 
> His gift of that book was wasted on me. I've failed my party. Again.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> This house of out reminds me of the Caves of Calmness.
> 
> Pronounced strangely by not-goblins, the Caves were a soothing grotto of the mirthiest, most charitable goblinfolk one could ever randomly encounter.
> 
> Raided we were, often, by bullying humanfolk, twisting my heart sour. Took they from us our treasures, not just of coin, but those of pride and stout-heartedness. Now I steal these treasures back, but from mine own minions...nay! My friends.
> 
> Dint was right to leave.
> 
> What's this I hear?
> 
> "OHMUHGAHD!!!!!! UHHHHH MUHHHHHH GAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!"
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> Spotted the skeletal bastards from the ruined tower, I did, and then calmly called out, "Gods! They come!" or something to that effect.
> 
> Tyr then did grant my stubby limbs much speed and...nah he didn't.
> 
> Suck I.
> 
> Wait.... A goblin-man comes to rush me, his arms outstretched....
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> WILL WE DIE? For certain! But punch we first?! NINE HELLS YES we will, on Chahd's stupidest of faces! This is the song stirred in me by the words just spoken!
> 
> You see, sitting piggy about the back of Bri'An, Squirladax called UNTO US in a voice more powerful than ten irritating goblins!
> 
> "Forces of the dreaded Shadowfell, prepare to march on this realm!"
> 
> Sad Sasha was the first to answer: "But we have no front line! No adequate fighter!"
> 
> OH QUEEN, tell no one that I was actually impressed when hated goblinman turned his beady eyes unto our forlorn hearts and pronounced with shrill grandeur.
> 
> "Sasha! The mutilations you've inflicted upon thyself are greater than any wound of death! Thus, you are the mightiest WARRIOR...in easily like three miles!"
> 
> Continued he, weaseling his logic upon our wills.
> 
> "DEELIA! Your Queen shall smile at your noble stand against Orcus's minions! And you, UNHOLY AVENGER, shall burn Chahd's bones as kindling!"
> 
> He then turned to the smallest dragon-man.
> 
> "Bri'An. Your faith may be a lie, but my faith in you is not. Take up Tyr's banner one last time, old friend."
> 
> TO WAR!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> WARFARE GUYYYSSS! Let me catch you up! So, there's this old watchtower ruin thing on this hill. That's HOMEBASE. Two paths up the hill to the tower, one NORTH, one SOUTH. Chahd is coming from the NORTH, so Deelia has ordered that we pepper the north slope.... WITH TRAPS, GUYS! TRAPS! Tripwires! Crossbows! SPIKED PITS! ISN'T THAT WICKED?
> 
> The SOUTH slope is our escape route if things go sideways.
> 
> HERE'S THE PLAN!
> 
> The Bureau will stand upon the hill and "vex Chahd." Chahd, now "vexed," will surely release his skeletal minions charging up the hill...INTO THE TRAPS! THEN, we reveal our wrath, attacking viciously until we KILL us a FREAKING VAMPEER, which is, I guess, easier than killing a Vampire....
> 
> But still, really cool!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> They come close, now, from the north. Some twenty strong...Against four.
> 
> Tyr, I've never prayed to you before. Grant me righteous speed as 'twere it likely that mine friends will be flayed screaming and suckled alive at the snapping smiles of Skeletal Vampeergroup.
> 
> A light rain now falls...which will only make my plated feet slippy.
> 
> Uh...thanks Tyr.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> CHAHD AND HIS COLUMN OF DEATH HAVE ARRIVED!
> 
> I must now draw him to mine trappèd field! Let a DUELING OF VEXES COMMENCE!
> 
> Velveteen capèd Chahd, speaks with haughty loudness over the rains and spans betwixt us.
> 
> "Ah, the Tasty Tetrad! Even now, I sauce and season your cadavers in my mind's kitchen, to be prepared tenderly and servèd...to my master."
> 
> It is now, NOW that I unleash the vexing scornings of wit, "Never, betrayer! Bet I not that your master doesn't even dislike you!"
> 
> Paused, did Chahd, as my vexing does take hold! Clearèd his throat, he croaks, "Do you sayeth...wait.... You are saying he likes me? Or that he doesn't like me? Because I can assure you—"
> 
> "NO ONE LIKES YOU, CHAHD!," bellowed a presumptuous but not incorrect Sasha.
> 
> Worn plainly on his stupid face, a perfect vexing achieved, we hold as he will surely now unleash his minions unto the slaughtering of our many traps before us!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> VEXÈD CHAHD does now **leisurely** lead his columns around from the north, circling our hill, and unto the SOUTH! The clear, trap-less passage to up here with us!
> 
> Calls Chahd out, "Do you think I STUPID? Only a Shadow's Edge **novice** could reveal her machinations so! Let me to the guessing! Traps? Worry not, I shall be with you soon enough."
> 
> All is lost, but for one last card in my [Tarokka Deck](Mechanics/decks/tarokka-deck-cos.md). I shall weave inspiring bardic magic!
> 
> Sasha asks if she is to hold the front line, whilst Deelia lays about damaging spells, and to Bri'An the restoration of vigor!
> 
> Instead, I say:
> 
> "Remember, my friends.
> 
> There is truly only one rule in War!
> 
> GO OUT THERE...
> 
> ...and just be yourself. Cuz that's...ya know...what they're looking for."
> 
> And I can feel their hearts swell with braveness.
> 
> Yet then, Chahd marches up from the south, and he did smile a wide toothèd grin, and by the GODS...
> 
> HE HAD FANGS!

## Elven Flatbread

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/136_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Elven Flatbread is much more of a delight than its unassuming name suggests. A mosaic of colors and flavors, the thinly sliced vegetables, edible flora, and wild herbs are so elegantly placed atop this chewy focaccia that you almost want to admire it more than eat it. A cornucopia of garden-fresh components frequently make starring appearances—from onions, bell peppers, chives, and cherry tomatoes to sunflowers, elderflowers, squash blossoms, and sprigs of basil. Almost nothing is off-limits when it comes to topping; the only (unspoken) rule is to keep it vibrant and arrange them artfully. Despite elven flatbread being a "simple" bread recipe, Feywild eladrin pride themselves on flare and personal presentation. During harvest holidays, each flatbread is presented as a long and ornate loaf that serves as both a centerpiece and a meal starter for dipping in sharp, fragrant olive oils.

## Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/137_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

For those adventurers fortunate enough to dine shoulder to shoulder with the nature-loving Archfey of the Seelie Court, cheese and potato soup is a hearty, not-to-be-skipped starter that warms from the inside out. This slow-simmered, savory concoction is a delightful mix of potatoes, onions, celery, chives, and ripe herb-infused cream cheese. It is so delightful in fact that it has escaped the mystical confines of the Feywild, making its way within the bustling walls of the Sword Coast port metropolis of Baldur's Gate, to the iconic Elfsong Tavern, where it has become a regional favorite capitalizing on the cornucopia of fresh ingredients on offer. Regardless of where you sample this surprisingly light and tasty soup, the spirit of the Seelie Court original is in every spoonful.

## Elfharrow Baked Goat Cheese

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/139_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1_2.webp#center)

Centuries of deforestation has caused the elves of Elfharrow to get more creative with their diets than those of their forest-based counterparts. Raising livestock has become a way of life for these elves, making dairy a central staple of their foodways. This traditional Elfharrow dish features medallions of goat cheese crusted in breadcrumbs and baked. The key ingredient, though, is a tangy mustard, said to originate in the Feywild, and the dish goes best with a green salad on the side. A word of caution: Don't try to source your ingredients in Elfharrow—these elves are quite a bit more territorial and protective than their northern cousins and a visit there could be your last.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/140_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

## Harengon Coffee Carrots

Nothing says *harvest* like the colorful dish known as Harengon Coffee Carrots. An unexpected journey of flavors, fresh wild-picked carrots are simmered with mountain-grown kaeth (or coffee) and a generous amount of beet-derived molasses. A touch of thyme and finely aged balsamic vinegar round out this sweet and acidic treat, so perfectly balanced that even the eladrin of the Feywild often include it as a staple of their elaborate forest feasts. The harengon, rabbit-like denizens of the Feywild, famously prepare this dish with a veritable rainbow of orange, red, white, yellow, and purple carrots, emphasizing presentation as much as flavor. The inspired infusion of coffee provides a robust tang that will also add zip to anyone's step, especially the harengon who are known for their exuberance. When it comes to the serving table, this vibrant fall side is bound to bring you back for more.

## Brackleberry Jam

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/142_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Brackleberry Jam is the Cormyrean moniker for a spread made from a medley of freshly foraged wild berries—one that has earned notoriety throughout the multiverse. While the Cormyr version utilizes strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries, and even currants, all iterations of this well-traveled recipe call for fresh blueberries and sugar to properly flavor the mixture. A spritz of lemon and a dash of salt help to not only preserve the mash for canning but brighten the overall experience on the palette. Brackleberry Jam is as common as butter in the forest-heavy country of Cormyr, where its topography and climate yield an abundance of seasonal berries so plentiful they colorfully adorn the region's roads and trails. This jam spreads well on almost any warm loaf or muffin. In the Feywild, the berries are not only more bountiful but also more flavorful, resulting in an exquisite local variety of Brackleberry Jam.

## Fey Fritters

No elven feast is complete without a basket (or three) of freshly fried sweet-pea Fey Fritters on offer. The nuanced yet indulgent combination of fresh sweet peas, shallots, and feta cheese is a match made in Arvandor, especially once handfuls of the bite-size bounty are dipped in batter and fried to perfection. From Prismeer to Evermeet, elves and those with whom they hold court relish these comforting table treats. Fey Fritters come with a warning: Once you try one, you'll want to spend all day eating these scrumptious snacks...and often, in the Feywild, you just do! It is believed that the recipe originated a millennium ago in the elven enclave of Evermeet, far before it was transported to the Plane of Faerie following the Spellplague. These tasty delicacies have been a mainstay on elven dining tables ever since.

## Sprucebark Quaff

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/144_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

A refreshing nonalcoholic aperitif, the drink known as Sprucebark Quaff is famous throughout the multiverse for not only preparing the palate for flavor but also freshening the breath after meals. A simple concoction of clean, fresh water; mint; and sweet cucumber, it is served at upscale taverns, inns, and temples across the Prime Material Plane but is especially popular in the Feywild and upper planes, where a similar mixture forms naturally in many ponds, lakes, and streams. It's believed to have been invented by Faerûnian elves as a method of purifying water, using plants to remove toxins. Whatever its origin, it is sure to recharge trail-weary adventurers no matter what planet or plane they roam.

## Eldeen Banquet

Despite its promise of a "banquet," the dish known as Eldeen Banquet is actually a hearty, one-dish meal sure to satisfy omnivores as much as vegetarians. Consisting of lightly breaded and fried eggplant topped with a warm, seasoned tomato sauce, this delight hails from the Eldeen Reaches, in the Khorvaire region of Eberron, which is noted for its robust forests and agriculture, and where the dish has occasionally migrated to the Feywild via a secret Fey Crossing. But while Eldeen Banquet is considered a regional delicacy, interpretations of the crispy, yet spongy, eggplant patty are common in esteemed eateries throughout the city of Sharn. High-end restaurants such as the Azure Gateway and the Celestial Vista, in the Skyway district, offer plates of Eldeen Banquet as delightful as their views. However, perhaps the best preparation is found in the unassuming Olladra's Arms, in the Hope's Peak district. Here, the portions are as generous as they are flavorful, ensuring the dish truly lives up to its moniker.

## Saerloonian Glowfire

It is said that *everything* in the Feywild is more beautiful—and more delicious. That is undoubtedly true when it comes to imbibing the already supernaturally delightful Saerloonian Glowfire. First concocted centuries ago in Saerloon, a Sembian metropolis known for its cultured and exotic tastes, Saerloonian Glowfire has become a notable export the Realms over. It has even made its way to Evermeet, an elven paradise transported to the Feywild long ago. While human in origin, this aromatic bracer, renowned equally for its alluring luminescence as for its refreshing hints of summer breezes and ripe pear, feels right at home filling the ornate wine flutes of high elven society.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/148_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

## Elverquisst

This autumnal aperitif of rare quality and divine taste is customarily served in conjunction with an elven high ceremony. Traditional Elverquisst vintages are distilled from orosks and resmers (rare summer fruits indigenous to Evereska) and sunshine, and it sips as smoothly as a cool mountain stream. Elves store their Elverquisst in crystal decanters capable of absorbing light and showcasing the tantalizing specks of gold dancing about in the rich claret mixture. According to legend, upon whispering a secret Elvish phrase, the sunlight streaming through the bottle will gather into thirteen points, resembling the constellation Correlian. Regardless, Elverquisst is highly prized by the elves and is a uniquely enchanting sip for curious imbibers who can get their hands on a bottle of this rare beverage.

> 
> Then a slow-clap and wicked chuckles from the darkest rain-soaked smog. Cresting the slope pasty Chahd and his smiling skeletons.

> 
> Sasha and Dint locked eye to lens. She spoke simply.

> "Then we shall press the truth from him."

> 
> The fog of war clears. All is bone and shatter. Nothing stands. Not even one friend. But wait, hopeful reader! I see a cloistered group below! Huddled there is Deelia, cradling a shivering man. I rush forth and my goblin eyes boggle with amazement. Deelia holds a crushèd and stabbèd Chahd! But to see the fear in his eyes, the blood on velveteen cape and the broken **wooden fangs** hanging out his slackened jaw, he can only simply be "Chad."
> 
> Chad chokes out. "You were right, Deelia. Neither I vampire nor vampeer. It's just... I started hanging out with skeletons after Shadow's Edge burned down, and you know, they're super judgy. I just wanted them to like me."
> 
> Deelia sobs, "Then 'twas I that did this, Chad. Destroyed our school with flame. I did, and your only crime was to run screaming while ablaze to the Lords!... A tattle move, but still!"
> 
> See us all, Deelia's vexing was always of her own making, and thus did she comfort Chad by casting away the rain's chill... **with a gentle flame from her snapping fingers**, her powers restorèd by mercy.
> 
> Chad's shivering abated, his eyes glazed as death approached. Would not Deelia be pleasèd, as Chad's soul could now be whispered to her Raven Queen? But even as Chad's body went limp, she whispered through tears—
> 
> "Please..."
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)

> SO IT WAS THAT TYR'S SERVANT BRI'AN SNAPPÈD FORTH LIMBS AND SHINS AND CHINNY CHIN CHINS OF THE DAMNED IN HIS BATTLE 'GAINST UNDEATH. NOBLY HE FOUGHT, KILLING THE DEAD UNTO A DOUBLE-DEATH WHENCE NO SKELETON, SHALL 'ERE RETURN TO SNEER UPON THE LIVING.
> 
> And as Bri'An could deliver death to the dead, so might he deliver life unto the living? Thusly, the scoundrel dragonborn—himself for the first time in his life—did layeth hands on the frail Chad. And Tyr's grace fell as a rain, melting away eyeshadows and other gothic makeups Off the visage of Chad, who was deliverèd unto Tyr's Grace, ALIVE! So Sayeth We Thusly.

He has summoned a [HEROES' FEAST](Mechanics/spells/heroes-feast.md) of HFFotM, harengon coffee carrots, and the freshest of sprucebark quaff for all to sup!
> 
> 'Twas at that moment that mangled Dint lurched in the doorway, held up by Sasha and Deelia. his gut-gears still churning by the grace of his Otter Gnome gods.
> 
> A tear running down my face, I placed a hand upon the pauldroned shoulder of my shadowy double and spoketh thus: "You can keep your Astral Diamonds, dear Master of Treason."
