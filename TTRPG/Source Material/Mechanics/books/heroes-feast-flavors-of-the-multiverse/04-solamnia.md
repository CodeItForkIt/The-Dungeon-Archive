# Solamnia
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 65* 

Poisoned! Bri'An, Cleric of Tyr, sipped too deeply of the quest item: a venomous wine! Now, our heroes sail through Realmspace to KRYNN, the planet of the fabled dragonlances, to seek a cure for Bri'An's deadly affliction!

> Emergency! Set we down on a—plain? Realm? I still do not understand this Wildspace we travel in, but I do understand brisk dispatch.
> 
> Bri'An, our most righteous cleric, has confessed to sipping the very QUEST ITEM, a wine called VENENO '18, revealed now to be a DEADLY POISON! Dint explains that, to save our comrade, we must make landfall immediately on a place called Krynn to seek out and seize vallenwood root. It is the only hope of restoration for our doomed Bri'An. Whilst Bri'An professes perfect, jovial health, Dint tells of painful gasping death should we choose to ignore this.
> 
> As this is how TPK starts, I will not have another on my conscience. We landed and set about our business immediately! Well—almost immediately. First, we should find something to eat.... Any adventure that begins on an empty stomach is doomed to fail!

> I tire of this quest! This spelljammer rattles me. All I wish is to serve the Raven Queen, and yet I have whispered no souls to find her embrace. All is gloom. This bright, green world of—what calls itself? Krynn? A city called Solanthus? The cheer of this place mocks my grim purpose: To bolster the Raven Queen's numbers in her everlasting battle with Orcus, Lord of the Damned and King of the Undead. Only then can I win her esteem, and perhaps then I might find a lasting peace in her Shadowfell.

> Bri'An is the coolest cleric I have ever met. Not only does he effortlessly guzzle the local Tika's Honey Mead, not only can he tavern-brawl jerks with mighty punches, but he has also been helping me train as we both read from *Volo's Guide* on health and wisdom. It's the king's jewels, man!
> 
> But what I don't get: Why won't he cure himself of this nasty poison with his healing magic? He calls on Tyr with almost every step he takes...maybe it isn't working? I wish I was learnèd enough in such matters to help. Even now, Bri'An is rubbing Boar Hock Soup into my scalp to increase my cleverness, so recommends the guide.

> Why are the side-eyes spying me? What harm have Dragonmen done here on this Krynn, in this forsaken tavern called the Dog and Duck in the city of Solanthus? Tyr! Sasha and I beg forgiveness as we punch these jeering faces to weepiness. I shall sweep these sins off my plates and instead gorge myself of the delicious pastry-like Cloaks and seductive Tarsis-Style Shrimp so that I might have strength to serve your will. Praise be to Tyr!

> Alas, I must have eaten too much Kendermore Cobbler—I feel not good.

> Huzzah! We have made the acquaintance of a local herbalist who tarries about the Vingaard River, yet he possesses no vallenwood root. Bri'An is now issuing a holy commandment that I share in some of his Salbread. Oh my! Tyr's heavens inside my mouth-hole!
> 
> I tell you, saucy reader, savor the small things. Especially when those small things can be crunched, swilled, or suckled. The life of many adventurers is fleeting, and they would do well to be mindful of the many curious places that their trail passes through. Any decrepit tavern could be home to a specialty that would be wondrous to any who had never tasted it before.

> Bri'An woke this morning, sweating, and coughing up black gunk. We're at this inn called the Black Tiger and I just talked to the inn keep. We gotta find this vallenwood root, but he warns that the mightiest and most mature vallenwood grows many leagues to the south in the lands of Abanasinia or something. Cool! Got it! Time to stretch my breath bellows to their limit and kick this side quest in the arse! Bri'An rocks and we got this!

> Tyr! My faith and health are tested! My throat fire burns icy, my scales dribble with unholy perspiration. Yet, I know I shall be healed by faith! Yea, even as this prayer leaves my lips, I feel vigor and not a small amount of vim returning. Yes recovery is upon me. What 'tis?! A roadside food stall serving yet more scrumptious morsels in this most delicious of realms?! This I must investigate!

## Boar Hock Soup

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/068_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Whether you make boar hock soup at the hearth of a cozy inn or on the campfire after the hunt, it is a meal unto itself. Like traditional bone-based soups, this version was originally created to let no part of a boar go wasted—in this case, the hock, or lower leg. But in times of plenty, you can still find soups filled with generous chunks of boar and without any bones to speak of. The genius of this recipe is in its recognition that boar is best complemented by a classic, creamy potato-leek soup. Brimming with whatever other veggies and spices you can get your hands on—even chestnuts are great in the mix—it is a savory, hearty celebration of the bounty of nature. Perfect for a cold, windy night.

## Cloaks

Ideal as a filling comfort food, cloaks are finger snacks made from whipped potatoes, eggs, butter, and fresh spices. They get their name from their shape; as they bake, puffing into luxurious, golden-brown coverings, which look like warm winter cloaks. While some taverns pan-sear Cloaks in oil to give them a crispy, crunchy exterior, most establishments bake them and the dish is often thought to be best right out of the oven, soft and piping hot inside. On a cold day, a few Cloaks will warm you right up. In Kalaman they squeeze a bit of lemon juice on top to give it a little zing, and in springtime, it's not unusual to find a few edible flowers draped over them. Cloaks make a perfect side for fish or poultry, but eat enough of them, and you may end up skipping the main course entirely.

## Salbread

For those light-footed smallfolk who wander but still want to eat well, the kender of Kendermore look to salbread. This highly flavorful, square bread can last a full tenday in the pack before spoiling—or so it is said, as the actual expiration time frame has never been tested. These baked treats travel so well, they have found their way to many other corners of the multiverse and frequently show up in the packs of the halflings of Luiren, who are thought to be distant cousins of Krynn's kender. Usually made with lemon or orange peels and a touch of vanilla, these baked miracles not only taste delicious but also can prevent scurvy for those on ships or traveling in regions without access to fresh fruit.

## Kender Stumblenoodles

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/074_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Kender legends have a way of shifting and swaying merrily with the tides of the Blood Sea of Istar. An early tale held that kender stumblenoodles were born of a collision between two frantic kender cooks—when their pots mixed, it resulted in an unexpected alliance of flavors and ingredients. However, ask a kender adventurer, and you may as likely hear a yarn concerning a well-placed insult aimed toward a draconian corporal and his squad. As the bold kender scoundrel made haste to flee, he frantically threw about any valuables behind him to dissuade his pursuers. In his desperation, he ejected a small sack of mixed spices, hardened cheese, a jar of mustard, and several handfuls of uncooked spiral pasta shells that, as kender luck would have it, served as a meal of caltrops for draconian toes and sent the kender's pursuers stumbling into the mud. In honor of this brave kender's sacrifice (the loss of a perfectly good sack of pasta), kender across Krynn have memorialized the occasion in classic, good-humored kender fashion.

## Tarsis-Style Shrimp

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/077_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

A famous dish from the Inn of the Last Home, perhaps the most storied tavern in all of Krynn, Tarsis-Style Shrimp is a rich and creamy, belly-filling shellfish concoction. In this delectable maritime offering, poached shrimp are combined with a fresh yogurt-dill sauce, which can be delightful when dolloped atop long, homemade noodles. In a popular iteration of this dish, detailed in the culinary notes of Tika Waylan, former barmaid at the inn, "pulled turkey breast is substituted for the shrimp and enlivened with a dash of dry white wine." The sauce itself is so flavorful, it can perk up even the most mundane meats, something resourceful locals were forced to do post-Cataclysm, which left the Tarsis seaport landlocked. Regardless of your protein of choice, this is a not-to-be-missed regional delicacy.

## Plate of Silver

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/078_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

In the Faerûnian land of Amn, there is a charming, well-appointed inn called Stargath House, which is known for a signature baked-potato-and-anchovy dish called the Plate of Silver. The meal is thusly named as consolation and warning to those who would sate their appetites by seeking the fabled treasures reputed to be hidden in an extensive network of booby-trapped and haunted cellars underneath the inn. The treasured gold is said to rattle inside the chest plates of [helmed horrors](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/helmed-horror.md) that seek to claim the lives of trespassers. Many a guest has disobeyed the firm guidance of the courteous waitstaff and gone missing. It is tradition that when the unique delicacy is served, the staff and regulars of Stargath House rattle their gold coins inside tumblers as a way of presenting the recipient of Stargath hospitality with a choice: "Would you risk a cold and bitter death for the promise of haunted gold? Or would you kindly settle for a warm, tasty plate of silver, instead?" Both the dish and tradition have somehow found their way to Krynn, even though Stargath House is nowhere to be found on the planet.

## Stuffed Trout

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/079_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Those who happen upon the Solamnian city of Palanthus would be fools not to drop by the A Taste of Silvanost restaurant and try its famous Stuffed Trout. Of course, what the trout is stuffed with is anyone's guess. According to the menu (which is written in Silvanesti), you'll find "specially prepared mixtures" inside. But rumor has it the stuffing is composed of breadcrumbs made from the fresh-baked loaves of the elven proprietor Solamna Farseer, and seasoned with a rare spice known as Old Bay, named for the Bay of Branchala, next to which the city rests.

## Kender Loaf

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/080_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Kender loaf, or raston pastry as it has been called, is a filling, raisin-specked dessert to round out a hearty meal. However, in its earlier incarnations, raston pastry dated back to the first Dragon War, when not even scraps of stale bread could be discarded. Crusts of stale bread were habitually tossed into a basin and later mashed to create livestock feed, but the kender saw an opportunity. Stale bread was separated from other half-finished morsels; soaked in water; sugared, spiced, and dried; then served up as what was known as kender loaf, the pre-owned bread. So popular was kender loaf that the process was refined with eggs, cream, and spices, evolving into the bread puddings we know today.

## Kendermore Cobbler

Nothing warms the soul quite like the scent of a freshly baked kender cobbler. The flavor of this effervescent blend of peaches, dark berries, vanilla, cloves, and liquor (for the brave, a sizable enough dash to make your toes tingle) is as fascinating as the diminutive folk who invented it. Kender—said to be birthed of magic and chaos—approach food in much the same manner as they traverse the worlds of the multiverse: adventurously. The buttery, flaky topping oozing with soft, chopped peaches should be enough, but when combined with blueberries, the cobbler filling brightens in a curiously kender way. This dessert is especially popular on Mid-year Day in Sixthmonth, which also happens to be Peach Month in Ansalon, but it remains the dessert of choice for the kender of Krynn regardless of holiday or season. Often served as a cobbler, sometimes as a crumble, but never to be skipped, especially when offered warm with a hefty dollop of fresh whipped cream.

## Irlymeyer's Dragonfire Punch

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/082_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

The golden rule with any good tavern punch is that, when going down, it should feel like you were struck by a physical one and make you more inclined to throw one. Such is the case with the potent potable sometimes called Irlymeyer's Dragonfire Punch. A creation of the mysterious mixologist for whom the drink is named, and perfected by Otik Sandath of the Inn of the Last Home, this refreshing beverage is chock-full of domestic and imported juices from across Krynn, including cranberry, orange, and pineapple. The "punch" comes from the generous amounts of brandy and sparkling wine. Originally named for its use of poisonous dragon's rose blossoms, the recipe has changed significantly over the years, but its effect upon patrons has not.

## Tika's Honey Mead

Purists drink mead straight, savoring the often complex flavor of the honey, which varies with the different bees and flowers they work. The traditional mead made in Morning Dew, near the Plains of Dust, in Krynn, has its advocates. But why not spice it up in the style of adventurer and former mixologist at the famous Inn of the Last Home Tika Waylan? A much tangier, more citrus-forward concoction, Tika's mead balances the sweetness of the honey syrup and the bottled mead with a more pure alcohol. The combination is chilled with ice and served cool. Be careful, though. If you're used to a mild mead, you'll find that Tika's version packs quite a bit more punch.
