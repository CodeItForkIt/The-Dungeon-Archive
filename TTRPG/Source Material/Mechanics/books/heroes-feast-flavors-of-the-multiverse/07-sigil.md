# Sigil
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 153* 

Having barely escaped Chahd's cruelty in RAVENLOFT, and with the help of Tyr's holy servant, our heroes fling themselves through secret portals and magical gateways of the multiversal planescape into SIGIL, the fabled CITY OF DOORS!

> 
> Treason. Doors, and more doors. But the final door, fearful reader, has been finally unbolted to the darkest basement in a goblin's heart.
> 
> On yesternight, Bri'An, fresh from his miracle, plucked Dint from the ruined spelljammer, and piously unburdened a (surprising) meal of gemstone treasures into Dint's greedy gullet. Sparked to life did Dint angrily, and with shaking fist, coughed indignities meant to soil our honor!
> 
> And then HE RAN! "AFTER HIM!" I cried!
> 
> And would'st thou be shocked to learn that Dint KNEW PRECISELY how to flee the mist-shrouded lands where Chahd's treason and Dint's betrayal make spouse, wedded in unholy union against us. But now, through many portals of smoke and magic and strange hidden doors, we hath apprehended he! Seized Dint, our tormentor!
> 
> It is now under the topsies and turvies of the strangest city, in a dank morgue cellar, that Dint awaits justice, strapped thusly in a chair by iron rings in this cold forgotten vault. Here, the flames of treason burn dimly, and for the last time, in the glassy lenses of Dint's mocking helmet.

> 
> Squirladax has lost it. He's currently...fighting a mop, tugging at its moppy hairs!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> I have powdered with flour Squirladax's mop-wig. He now has the countenance of a distinguished minister of a house of justice. We now defer to the traditions of the legal system!
> 
> Followed by execution of Dint. Obviously.

> 
> ON THIS DAY, YEAR OF TYR'S JUDGMENT, TODAY, THE TRIAL OF DINT THE BETRAYER, MASTER OF TREASON, SHALL NOW BEGIN. WE WILL COMMENCE BY REMOVING THE BRONZE PLATEMAIL OF THE BETRAYER SO THAT A PURIFYING FLAMBEAU MAY BE APPLIED TO HIS SOOTED TONGUE TO BURN THE LIES FROM OUT HIS MOUTH! IN TYR'S NAME!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> I delighted at the prospect of whispering Dint's soul to the Nine Hells, but now I am aghast, as the peeling of the bronze helm yields a CLOCKWORK MAN! An autognome with many gyres and gears for guts!
> 
> "More lies!" screams forth Judge Squirladax, "as Dint assured us that he was an 'Otter Gnome'!"
> 
> Hardly surprising that the Master of Treason has neither otter nor gnome inside his bronze skull! Heretic! BURN HE NOW WITH THE FIRES OF THE RAVEN QUEEN!
> 
> .... Which I would summon were I not still vexed.
> 
> Many damns upon you, Chahd!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> And so 'twas that Tyr's uneasy servant watched that Judge Squirladax called forth his first witness, "Dint. Architect of Treason, Master of Puppets," as christened by our judge and leader.
> 
> "Did not you, so-called 'Otter Gnome,' promise us FIVE ASTRAL DIAMONDS in payment of our questing?!"
> 
> And so rasped Dint, "Yes, goblin. But as the QUATERNATE TETRAD was not delivered to the customer, Master Chahd surely bequeathed a ONE. ASTRAL. DIAMOND. REVIEW."
> 
> "Ah! And you think you can abate the wrath of my RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT by HIDING THIS DIAMOND? WHEREFORE 'TIS IT, PUPPET MASTER? I WILL HAVE THE TRUTH!" howled Judge Squirladax.
> 
> ...All this talk of truth.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> Ah! I have called lunch break, and I mull over my next inquisitings as we feast on Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels and Fried Bread and Spices in pursuit of justice. Chahd the Betrayer of Deelia. Dint, the Puppet Master. Her **betrayer** linked to the strings of mine own **tormentor**. It all makes sense now, and as Dint puppeteers with malice, so too do I pull the strings righteously of my own companions.
> 
> Both us, short in stature. Both puppeteers. Dint is shadowy twin to mine self, thus making him my ARCH-NEMESIS. And how special a thing 'tis to have one's arch-nemesis in shackles and at the mercy of justice?
> 
> To think I ever felt guilt over having killed him.
> 
> I now drink this smoldering cup of Kaeth in exaltation. I think I shall have Sasha press the truth from him when we return.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> Tyr forgive me, for I could not stand by any longer! Deelia whooped many screeches of delight as Squirladax demanded back-breaking toils!
> 
> With every question, supine Sasha from a bench did press the poor squeaking Otter Gnome up off her chest in repetitions of eight! With Sasha suffering, now swollen armed and sopping, I knew I must act!
> 
> "BY TYR! I POISONED MYSELF!" I cried.
> 
> This did'st stop the screams and pressings.
> 
> "Poisoned we Dint first, with chippèd Ruby!" I howled.
> 
> This did'st earn a measure of widening from the judgmental goblin eyes!
> 
> "And FINALLY, did'st Tyr not witness our deception?! We are no Tetrad as we promised Dint!"
> 
> A shamed silence fell about every soul in that basement.
> 
> "Chahd withheld the Astral Diamonds because of OUR LIES! And if Dint has but one diamond, and this be HIS VERY FOOD....
> 
> A look of shame manifested on Deelia's demonic features.
> 
> "If we point greasy finger at HE, after our sumptuous lunching, might three equally greasy fingers be pointed back...at thee?!"
> 
> And Tyr looked and saw...
> 
> 'Twas food for thinking.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> Weeks have passèd since Dint's acquittal. 'Twas not finest my moment, but the legal system provèd sound and justice 'twas served. And served us well it did as we now swim in ASTRAL DIAMONDS! Twenty and one by my count!
> 
> How-fore thus?
> 
> Dint. He is a Fetch/Carry Questor. A deliverer of foods. Quest us with, say, Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish and bid us deliver these morsels to an address and so it shall be done. As reward, we accumulate Astral Diamonds. Now, plainly I have yet to caress one in mine own hand, but Dint's ledgers mark their birth, and we must first earn back a sum of diamonds equivalent to purchase he a new spelljammer to replace the demolished Dashor. Until then, deliver we the finest foods about the extra-planar bustle of Sigil, the mad City of Doors! I slow about the Great Bazaar of Sigil as Chirper's Sugar Biscuits beckon my goblin nose with the aromas of other-worldly spices.
> 
> I judgèd Dint a dark puppeteer. He is, instead, a kindly, and I think senseless, "Ahh—Tah—Muh—Tahn," what 'ere that is. But what am I, pulling at my minions' strings with glee?
> 
> Is this not my job?!...Why then does regret bitterly season my biscuits?
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> Tyr be praised! This band coins Astral Diamonds like a mint! Who knew piety could be so profitable! I ripped a sandwich in twain with my grinning fangs, then hurled the other half at a residential door! A TWENTY SECOND Astral Diamond is born! Huzzah!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Dint.webp#center)
> 
> Upon review of *Dungeons & Dining Digest*, that most authoritative periodical of culinary happenings, we have accrued twenty-two **One Astral Diamond Reviews**. Business is Non-Functional.
> 
> The squat cleric is egregious in his failed deliveries. I explain that a ONE DIAMOND RATING is FAILURE! He quips back "Tyr's bird is grasped in hand, and I care not how many twobirds lie in the bushels."
> 
> I calculate that our gross receipts equal 12 gold pieces. At this rate it will take two thousand and seventy-eight Sigil years to purchase a new spelljammer.
> 
> I am ruined.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> The Shadowfell 'tis real. I whispered a soul to the afterlife, and so did'st my Queen smile. Will there be peace for me? Why then is there no fire in my breast? Why can'st I, even now, summon a drooping spark to warm the Emerald Chicken that I journey to deliver?
> 
> UGH! Be-cause VEXED!
> 
> Sour memories rise to torment me. My unjust expulsion from Shadow's Edge Academy. I only lit the kitchen of Shadow's Edge ablaze...Well, in truth the whole of the academy **IS** a kitchen. Shadow's Edge is a culinary magic academy, of course! The abyssal secrets of the sweetest meats and cheeses, it once held. The physical building no longer remains, however. Nor any trace. 'Tis the truth of fire.
> 
> Also true is that Chad betrayed me! Fled he wailing from the inferno, howling for the aid of the Shadow's Edge Lords! Whining, burning child! Tattler of tales!
> 
> How dare he! "Fiery Fingers," he taunts even now in my dreams! Curse he, pretender to vampire peer groups! He vexes me from his seat of house-sitting power in the very Shadowfell I wish to return to. Untouched and untouchable, he steals my flame from me even now.
> 
> Vexed.

> 
> Demands! Dint has been trying to puppet master me into, get this, not tasting the foods that we deliver! First, he was all "You have to be on time!" And that's hard in the City of Doors! Cuz, if you walk through the wrong door, then you're like surrounded by this huge battle—a ranger and his party fighting a one-horned mage to save a baby unicorn, the cavalier wailing for help! Screw that! You run! Finally FIND the door, but it's NOT the door! It's a big, fake dragon head thing at a bizarro carnival!...So, turn back, right?
> 
> "You have to be on time!" but you're famished. So...you take a teeny little nibble, and you're a teeny, little late!
> 
> Squirladax says that food tasters were things that ROYALTY LOVED! We should be charging extra!

> ATTACKÈD! Tyr forgive me! Sasha and I were about to celebrate our twenty-third Astral Diamond over some Sensate Palate Cleanser when ghastly skeletons boiled up from sewer plates, clambered clickity out of windows and from miasmal alleyways! By Tyr, I could see the purple and red velveteen cape, standing atop a dark minaret, a pate of pasted blonde hair, smiling brighter than even the skeletal hordes! Chahd!
> 
> Sasha looked to me, a glittering hope upon her scabbèd, leech-suckèrd face.
> 
> And thusly I drew my holy hammer and spoke the words of Tyr's holy turning!
>

> And we've been found out.... I'm found out. I'm just a worthless chum-robbing thief.

## Sensate Palate Cleanser

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/122_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

The appetite of the Society of Sensation knows no bounds: they are the ultimate explorers of experience, which takes them to the extremes of the palate. But the unfamiliar can only really be tasted against the baseline of the common. The Sensates lighted on the free cucumber soup that came with a cheap inn room at the Slumbering Lamb in Sigil as the perfect neutral reference points for embarking on a culinary adventure. Area taverns catering to this clientele turned this dish into a chilled leek-and-cucumber-based puree. Even for those without the restless curiosity of a Sensate, this smooth and mild soup is a refreshing appetizer no matter where it's consumed.

## Fried Bread and Spices

Some believe that everything is better fried. Whether or not you agree, you wouldn't want to miss out on Fried Bread and Spices available at most taverns in the Lower Ward of Sigil. A popular breakfast staple on the planets Oerth, Toril, and Krynn, it is often served with poached eggs. The version most common in the City of Doors includes a unique seasoning mixture that borrows from all of them, with hints of cumin, coriander, cayenne, and even fennel. Whatever is in it, it's sure to brighten your meal, your day, and your journey onto the next plane.

## Beer Bread

Many eateries across the multiverse claim to have the best beer-bread recipe, but Fortune's Wheel, an upscale canteen in Sigil's aristocratic Lady's Ward, really does. Any bread with beer in the dough is considered a beer bread, and the results are usually as middling as the common brew. However, this recipe from Fortune's Wheel yields a moist and chewy loaf that is bound to become a mealtime staple on any dinner table. Different types of beer yield distinctive flavors of bread and, depending on the varietal, it may even add leavening to the baking process, changing the ultimate density of the loaf. But regardless of the beer you choose (the Fortune's Wheel uses a dark, dry stout), it's all about the quality of the batter.

## Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/125_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Sigil's lively marketplaces are brimming with strange, fresh meats and fish imported from across the greater multiverse. These expansive emporiums are an overwhelming explosion of scents, textures, colors, and flavors, not only making them a chef's dream but a breeding ground for new culinary ideas. Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels is one such intrinsically Sigil meal on offer in many of the city's six wards. While the combination of pork and mollusk might seem unusual, this atypical culinary marriage is what makes the meal uniquely Sigil. An inspired combination of surf and turf, this dish has made its way across the multiverse as far as the Cutlass of Luskan on Toril, where fresh mussels are harvested in droves from the Sea of Swords, while the cured bacon is brought in almost daily from Mirabar via the River Mirar.

## Chickpea and Spicy Sausage Soup

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/126_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Serving equally well as a solo course or as a starter paired with a lighter main, Chickpea and Spicy Sausage Soup is a hearty, delicious, protein-filled potage. As served in Sigil, this soup incorporates Sweet Larissa's sausages, imported from Plague-Mort—the less you know about how she makes them the better. But one thing you will know is she makes them hot: with the sort of spices mortals should avoid unless in ethereal form. The chickpeas offer a starchy and earthy sanctuary from the oily, spicy sausage and red pepper flakes, all of it swimming in a garlicky chicken broth, flavored with tomato. Common variations on this dish introduce tarragon for a pungent and inspired twist on the classic. Although widely available, and often considered a meal for the masses, this is nonetheless a delectable soup that has rightfully earned its place in the heart of many citizens of the greater multiverse.

## Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/127_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

While Sigil's Great Bazaar is perhaps the most famous market in the known multiverse—a vibrant conflux of cultures and cuisines—this self-proclaimed "city at the center of the multiverse" also boasts countless storefronts and street bazaars, offering equally rare and exciting gastronomy. Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish is one such inexpensive delicacy, readily acquired in the Lower Ward or the more destitute Hive Ward. As quick to fry as it is to consume, this chili-and-cayenne-tinged, batter-fried white fish is a feast for the taste buds. Best served sizzling-hot, straight from the pan, wrapped in locally cultivated lettuce or a flatbread for easy ingestion en route to the next plane.

## Emerald Chicken

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/128_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

It is fact that the only way in or out of Sigil is through one of the city's innumerable portals. It is also fact that while in Sigil, one must try the famous Emerald Chicken. Gifted its name from the splash of chopped greens, intermingled with chunks of fowl, chicken livers, onions, and a strong dash of incendiary spices, Emerald Chicken demands an adventurous palate—it was originally made for tieflings with fiendspices—and a cool glass of ale to quench the burn. A milder version became famous in far-off Purskul, on Toril, in eateries such as the Owlroost Head.

## Harmonious Barracks Meatloaf

If you intend to police the chaotic streets of Sigil, it's best not to do it on an empty stomach. The warriors of the Harmonium are deeply dedicated to keeping order but are perhaps not so adventuresome in their tastes, so this rich, filling meal-in-itself will keep a soldier on the march for hours on end. Heaps of it are hot and plentiful in their barracks in the Lady's Ward. To maximize its proteins, this dish includes not just lamb but a medley of meats, which gives it its distinctive, hearty flavor. Ironically, a certain quantity of this meatloaf somehow finds its way into the hands of street vendors—this is, after all, a town where everyone finds a way to turn a quick profit.

## Chirper's Sugar Biscuits

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/130_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

No matter what you order at Chirper's in the Market Ward of Sigil—from the Niflheim stag ribs to the slaad legs—the sugar biscuits are a complimentary finale. Whether you came for the dancing, the Seawind theater, an art exhibition, or just a quick visit to gawk at the Skull Museum, it is always worth grabbing a bite at Chirper's for the dessert alone. Acquiring the Bytopian chestnuts required to make the puffy dough might require planar travel, but primes can approximate the right taste by adding some cinnamon and cardamom to the mix. Best served with honey as a dip for an extra dash of decadence.

## Silverfruit Pie

Let it be known, silverfruit, also known as lychee or soapberry, makes for a truly heavenly pie. This medium-size, pink-skinned berry is known for being especially crisp and juicy, with hints of citrus and a floral aroma. But as a pie filling it's surprisingly creamy and custard-like, and it pairs wonderfully with a toasted, flaky crust. The Golden Bariaur Inn (in Sigil's Lady's Ward), which caters to highfalutin clientele from the Upper Planes, serves an astoundingly good slice of this silky dessert. Since Sigil has no natural resources, silverfruit is one of the many uniquely curated imports from the vast array of worlds to which the greater metropolis provides access.

## Kaeth

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/132_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Kaeth, or coffee, is an aromatic brew made from ground roasted beans and is famous for its invigorating properties, making it a prevalent day starter throughout the worlds of the multiverse. In Sigil, the City of Doors, planar sightseers can sample from a wide array of coffee beans and beverages from countless planets. Kaeth, as it is commonly called on the planet Toril, has developed into quite the delicacy along the Sword Coast, where it is now imported in droves. In the nation of Sembia, a popular method of preparation features a blend of melted chocolate and liquor. In some areas, kaeth is so popular that it has become more profitable than the tea trade. The peoples of the planet Krynn drink tarbean tea and kefre, both of which are derived from vibrant, dark-roasted beans and frequently served black. In contrast, citizens of the Outer Planes imbibe numerous spiced and creamed variants of kaeth, including the notable Mountain Majesty of Mount Celestia. On the planet Oerth, coffee trends more acidic and is frequently blended into creamy liquors to grant an extra kick. But perhaps the most notable, kav'la, in which creamed coconut milk is swirled into a malted, dark, nutty roast, is served in tall, ornate ceramic vessels and is easily found in the cultured bazaars of Sigil. Regardless of which varietal you choose, kaeth, in its endless forms, serves as a caffeine-infused pick-me-up, whether on the trail or in the safe confines of one's homestead.
