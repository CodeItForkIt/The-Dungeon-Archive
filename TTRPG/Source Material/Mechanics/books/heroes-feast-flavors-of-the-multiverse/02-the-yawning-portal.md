# The Yawning Portal
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 1* 

Our brave heroes gather at the legendary Yawning Portal tavern in the Forgotten Realms, eager to take part in delving and dining!

> 
> The Yawning Portal. Cursed reader, if you are unfamiliar with this place, let me be the first to admonish and congratulate you. If you have never been, **do not go**. If you have gone, do not come back....
> 
> It is a tavern. A place of merriment for all. It is also a cork—a giant stopper on a jug of poisoned wine, for the Yawning Portal is built on top of a giant stone well that plummets fathoms down into the tunnels of the mad mage Halaster. They call it Undermountain, and it is down there that the soulless corpses of failed adventurers feed carrion crawlers and worse.
> 
> But up here, all is laughter, and the amber light of candles and sconces glow amid wafting aromas of faraway spices. Up here, the bodies have animated, haughty, mirthful expressions. Up here the bodies still have souls.
> 
> That's where I come in.
> 
> I am Deelia, collector of souls. Why am I here? Because Squirladax has proclaimed that we "do our part" in this year's "Great Delving." Apparently, the idea is that one drinks and feasts at the tables poised about the gaping well that falls to the dungeons below. When an adventurer's group has its glut of rothé steak or sornstag, that group boards a sturdy "elevator" platform, dangling from ropes above this pit. It is then that the pulleys squeal, and the group makes its slow descent to Undermountain to "battle evil." It's a party.
> 
> Group after group go down, and groups minus one or more come back up, often with grievous wounds rebuking the mirth of hours before. It is for this reason that the Yawning Portal's swarthy proprietor [Durnan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/durnan-wdh.md) hires clerics and those of magical salves to await the broken adventurers to heal their wounds and hopefully save lives.
> 
> So, of course, Squirladax—wielding one stone to murder many birds—has invited a pious little dragonborn cleric named By'ron (or something) to join our Bureau. He shall mend holes in our holey purses, for every life he saves here brings to us needed coin.
> 
> And if the lives cannot be saved, well, I am here to whisper a word of guidance to their souls to send them...elsewhere.
>

> 
> So, we're super short on money—I hope no one minds that I ordered the cow butter. I do believe this is a business expense. According to my new/used *Volo's Guide to Bodily Health*, gifted to me by wise Squirladax, "a washing of wounds in rich butters" will totally "oil the joints" and give me the speed and agility that I lacked in the...uh...TPK. Oh crap! I ordered the SALTED butter! Oh well...As *Volo's Guide* says, "There is no gain without pain." Maybe I should order some of those "famous" Yawning Portal biscuits to lather the excess on. I'm freaking starving!

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Ugh. Bri'An (I guess is his name) has laid many benedictions at the lip of the chasmal well to various so-called adventurers. "Tyr be with the brave." "Tyr guide and protect you."
> 
> Tyr can suckle the worms from their guts.
> 
> So far, three groups have descended to Undermountain. None have returned of yet. My tankard of Neverwinter Nectar is running low. As is my patience.
> 
> I spy pathetic Squirladax cradling that sad bit of ruby he treasures.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> BISCUITS?! NECTARS?! These I did not authorize! There shall NOT be foods to cram into our filthy mouth-holes, I commanded, for I do not trust THESE PRICES! We have a plan and must stick't'it! Soon, wounded heroes will appear up from the well, Bri'An will mutter holy jumblings of healing miracles, we will collect coin, then off we will abscond with heavy purses! Any are welcome to persuade me otherwise, but the charisma of my minions sags lowly. I chortle at their famishment!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> The HFFotM and Butternut Beer have buoyed me to a bouncy slosh. Eleven groups have descended and FINALLY, Undermountain spews these "heroes" back bleeding with screamy mouths and weepy eyes! Oooo! Some limbs have been amusedly cleavèd! NOOO! The blasted clerics have prevented fatalities with their priggish priestly zeal.
> 
> Several clerics have retired for the evening already, their holy might spent.
> 
> But Bri'An furtively observes, prattling quietly of Tyr's graces. Is't too much to wish for ONE CORPSE?! For without the dead, I cannot send ANY on their journey.... Patience!
> 
> Meanwhile, Sasha is chewing off her fingers' nails in hunger.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> A yearning pang in my gutsack! It has been hours now, and my ribs quarrel with my brains. OK! I have made the executive decision to order a plate of Goldenstars and a single Onion Loaf. 'Twas the last of our coppers, but filling enough, and will perhaps staunch the greedy lips of my minions long enough for Bri'An to work his blasted miracle and for us to get paid!
> 
> I've come to wonder of Bri'An's powers. Although his faith is unquestioned, he has only laid hands to heal one of us...and it 'twas himself. However—I am reminded—he professed to feel much better after laying hands on he, Tyr be praised.
> 
> The wounded burble up from Undermountain bloody and babbling, and two more clerics have collapsed of exhaustion in their attempts to save the anguished heroes.
> 
> NOW! I call forth Bri'An to HEAL! But Bri'An bids me hold, for firstly he must limber up.
> 
> Not long, my sweet Ruby, 'til you shall be matriarch to a family of jewels and treasures.
> 
> ZOUNDS! SASHA HOWLS! Why now do tears spray from her eyes, why does she scrub at her wounds with sticks of salty butters. WHAT?! I DID NOT AUTHORIZE BUTTERS!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Bri'An's warm-up blessings bless this unholiest of drinking holes, and still, no one has died. At this, I am sullen.... I am also very drunk. Dismay floods my sinking heart as I realize that **these last groups** returning may be my last hope at a bounty of freshly slain souls.
> 
> Squirladax screeches fiscally at young Sasha, while Bri'An plays DARTS!? This is torment! Let us heal these maggots and be OUT! Bri'An now cries out to the kitchen, something about a "Heroes' Feast."
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> By my honor, what happened was NOT MY FAULT! Here's how it played, on Tyr's honor.
> 
> The Heroes' Feast arrived. Clearly a gift from the house for faithful service. We did what Tyr bid when he lay his bounty before you. We feasted upon succulent, sandwich—like Talyth and the freshest of green Chopforest. The main course, that of the most blessed Hot River Crab Bites, followed by a most pious Laumberry Pie, served alongside Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk and a HFFotM.
> 
> Sasha feasted the feast of warriors.
> 
> Deelia found a peace unknown to her cursed people in potent drink!
> 
> Our leader Squirladax sang goblin songs through sharp teeth, stippled with the finest meats and pastries!
> 
> AND I GAVE THIS! MY service here this night.... By Tyr's grace, of course.
> 
> Then the rickety squeals of the winch screeched my senses to sharpness as the elevated platform began its slow ascent! A cry, "Adventurers return...and with wounded!"
> 
> I...must guess...that some mechanical failing occurred with the winch and the platform plummeted to Undermountain.
> 
> I shall never forget their cries or their brave sacrifice. May Tyr greet them at his holy gates.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> WHAT HELL?! I keep replaying the events in my drink-addled brain. What I saw I could not have. Shortly before the winch broke, a flit of parchment appeared on our table. A bill—a wicked BILL. The cost, presumably, of the Heroes' Feast. Ne'er have I seen such want of coin, such greed, as that of the wretched BILL.
> 
> Bri'An and I locked eyes over this grave, unjust report. Then it was Squirladax's eyes that went wide as he shook his head and slipped Ruby back into his pouch. Not TWO, nor FIVE BUREAUS OF DARK TABLES could ever hope to pay off this bill.
> 
> I knew in that instant what must be done.
> 
> With a scream, I summoned all the powers of the Raven Queen and vaporized this ghastly receipt...with fire!
> 
> At the same moment, following what plan I know not, Bri'An drew his smiting hammer and shattered the winch in blind, shrieking panic!
> 
> For this I will not forgive him, for as Sasha and Squirladax bid us FLEE the Yawning Portal, I was robbed of my chance to collect what surely was a bounty of souls at the bottom of the well! Queen, forgive me!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> I am so freaked out right now. An ambush! City Watch officers jumped out at us in an alley behind the Blackstar Inn! Squirladax shoved me back toward them screaming that I should "assume the front line." His heave knocked me into their grasping gauntlets! I thought for sure they had me, but their grabbing hands slipped off my heavily buttered limbs. I fled swiftly!
> 
> I'm breathing so heavy right now, guys, but you should have seen how fast I was! Anyways, while I have clearly improved speed and dexterity thanks to my butter treatment, it has become clear, as I gasp for breath, that my breath bellows are weak and need strengthening. There's a whole chapter on this in the *Volo's Guide*, and I have to work on this.

> 
> My shockèd goblin mind is racing, my lungs burn with the ill humors of exhaustion. We have been hiding in a Waterdeep sewer drain for nigh.... I do not know how long! The sun's rays peek over the rooftops as throngs of City Watch seek us! WHAT happened?! Bri'An isn't talking.
> 
> Running is hopeless. The Bureau's bellies are bursting of crustaceans and cheeses, and their sweat is as of gravy. I'd stop to ask them for council but their brains are bobbing in a wash of mead! I require time to plot our next move.... Wait! Bobbing in a wash! That's it!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> I lurch about an unevenly planked floor. Squirladax, the foul rodent, beams above me with pride and boasts of our newfound "safety." The room in which I find myself is not safe! It is cursed with a swaying that roils the mead still sloshing in my guts.
> 
> Goblin "leader" Squirladax has funneled us to shelter in the hold of some ship, and the room spins. The wafting aroma of dead fish twists at my gorge. There is also the clanging of the City Watch bell that rattles my throbbing skull.
> 
> All I wish to know is, why in the Nine Hells was a Heroes' Feast ordered and why did we not sacrifice Ruby to pay for it?!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> Deelia has confronted me about Ruby, and why she was not sacrificed to ransom us against our dangers. Ruby is not coin to be tossed aside. Ruby is the mother of future fortunes. Oh wait. Oh no! Wherefore art my beloved Ruby?! I sweep my pockets with goblin fingers and feel her naught!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> BY TYR'S GRACE, DO YOU HEAR THE CLING CLANGING STEPS ON THE PLANKS ABOVE US? The City Watch have found us! We are certainly doomed! DOOMED!

## Goldenstars

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/028_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

As you step onto the docks of Berdusk, the Jewel of the Vale—perhaps fresh off one of the many boats that ply the River Chionthar—there's a good chance the first thing you'll eat will be a goldenstar. These rich little pastries, traditionally stuffed with a local chicken sausage and Goldenfields batatas and leeks, are known for their distinctive triangular shape. Vendors sell them everywhere, and their heartiness will tide you over until you can manage a sit-down meal. Varieties of the goldenstar have spread throughout the Sword Coast, from the river's end at Baldur's Gate to as far north as Neverwinter. But every time you eat one done right, you'll be brought back to the docks of Berdusk.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/029_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

## Talyth

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/031_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

The palm-size sandwich known as talyth is a beloved appetizer on many a menu, from Waterdeep and the rustic watering holes of Luskan to the cloistered refectories of Candlekeep and eateries as far east as the Sea of Fallen Stars where, it is said, the dish originated. Although countless variations exist, talyth commonly comprises meats (typically sliced sausage), cheese, spices, and herbs nestled between two large crackers, all lightly baked to adhere the layers. While the baking process seals in flavor, it also ensures its portability, making talyth a common travel snack along the major Faerûnian trade routes. Although frozen talyth can easily be reheated on an open campfire, freshly made talyth affords a more eclectic and adventurous array of savory ingredients, including diced egg, oysters, snails, and even spiced worms.

## Chopforest

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/032_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Many examinations of early Yawning Portal menus have noted that its heavy, often greasy, fare had a celebratory "last meal" sense about it. This is likely because return from the Undermountain was simply not expected, with only the soiled dishware of stout adventurers left behind. However, as more adventurers survived the mad mage Halaster's labyrinth, the menu evolved to accommodate a balance of healthier options. Senior cook Jarandur Tallstand adapted the traditional wood-elven forest salad, or chopforest, as it has been called, to complement the heavier menu options with its mix of peppered leaves, olives, fennel, and tangy vinaigrette dressing. It is said that a chopforest delivered unto your table, compliments of Yawning Portal proprietor and Undermountain gatekeeper [Durnan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/durnan-wdh.md), is a happy omen before one's descent to Undermountain.

## Hot River Crab Bites

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/033_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

A center of music and the arts, the town of Berdusk, in Faerûn's western heartlands, is known for many things, but above all for its hot river crabs. A specialty of the Sign of the Silver Sword Inn, these river delicacies are as dependent on freshness as on seasoning. Traditionally, locals would harvest crabs with soft shells and consume them within the day. As for the crab recipe, it's a closely guarded secret, but is believed to include crème fraîche and lemon zest mixed into a spread and served on endive. At only one copper piece per plate, they'll leave enough in your coinpurse for a glass of Saerloonian Glowfire—the perfect complement.

## Sornstag

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/034_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Popular at holiday gatherings of humans and elves alike, sornstag is a simmered venison dish that can be seasoned and prepared in a variety of ways. Traditional elven sornstag is slow smoldered with ground coriander, cumin, and hotspice or curry in a thick broth and is a popular plate among wood elves during the Highharvestide Festival. Humans have also adopted their own stewed preparation techniques for this gamey, yet succulent, main course. Throughout the wooded regions of Faerûn, stags are hunted by humans for both sport and meal, resulting in the proliferation of venison-based cuisine. In the bucolic forests and fields of the Dalelands, the most popular regional recipe for sornstag demands a full day's preparation. The traditional recipe calls for powdered almonds simmered with red wine to form the emulsified base of a piquant sauce, in which the meat soaks overnight before it is slow-cooked on an open flame from dawn for an early evening feast. But to get it to the table faster, you can skip the overnight marinade and cook it in an oven for just a few hours. Notably, the Silver Taproom, in Essembra, sees travelers from far and wide eager to sample its famous pied sornstag, which consists of a heaping ladle of this venison stew baked inside a buttery crust. You'll know the sornstag pies are ready when the scent of the aromatic pastry wafts down bustling Rauthauvyr's Road.

## Rothé Steak

One silver piece is an extraordinary bargain for the Rothé Steak at the Yawning Portal—even if it is one of the more expensive things on the menu. Served sizzling-hot right out of the skillet, with just a hint of garlic and garden spices, rothé steak is a carnivore's delight and the perfect protein for a triumphant or aspiring adventurer. Along the Sword Coast, you can easily source fresh [rothé](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rothe-vgm.md) that is either farm-raised or wild game—there are devotees of both. Why bother with any vegetable sides? You won't get to them with this slab of meat to tackle.

## Onion Loaf

The onion loaf on the menu at the Yawning Portal is done in the Cormyr style: big, dark loaves, as dense as the King's Forest. While the onion may be the headliner, the real stars of the show are the leeks, scallions, and fresh buttermilk, which help round out the flavors of this rich, crusty loaf—perfect for morningfeast or eveningfeast. When it's time to break bread with adventuring companions, old and new, an onion loaf is an inexpensive and delicious option that's practically a meal in itself.

## Sour Cream-Walnut Cake

It's rare to see this halfling specialty on the table, usually because it's gone before you ever catch a glimpse of it. Perfect for morningfeast, or teatime, the much-celebrated sour cream-walnut cake includes a delicious crumble of cinnamon, brown sugar, and walnuts, but it's the cake itself that takes the cake. A recipe passed down orally by generations of halflings, it is said to be made with the finest Luiren grain flour, fresh sour cream, and finely ground kaeth or coffee. The only known issue with the pastry is that there never seems to be enough of it.

## Laumberry Pie

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/038_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

The Yawning Portal of Waterdeep serves a new pie every week, based on the seasonal ingredients available. You're really in luck when laumberries from the frosty Frozenfar are in season. Their tartness is softened by the sweetness of the dough, making it the perfect blend of flavors. The famous tavern likely pilfered the idea from the hardy bakers of Bryn Shander. Pies in this style are made off-season with blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, which together give you something of the flavor of the original. They're best served a bit chilled, and when done right have been known to resurrect the spirits of weary adventurers emerging from the Undermountain.

## Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/041_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

While conventionally prepared with a base of [owlbear](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) milk, other types of milk such as yak milk, buttermilk, rice milk, and even nut milk are all suitable substitutes in this creamy, cozy concoction. But no matter which milk you choose, there is no alternative for Mingari spice, culled from the inner bark of Mingari trees. Likened in both flavor and scent to cinnamon, Mingari spice is a rare but highly sought-after seasoning indigenous to southeast Faerûn. Although rare, this strong, aromatic spice is incredibly versatile, at home in both sweet and savory dishes, and thus it has spread throughout the Realms and beyond. However, satisfying Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk requires merely a dash of this scarce but potent accent. Travelers in search of a day starter, an alcohol-infused night capper, or even a medicinal stomach soother, invariably relish a tall mug of this nourishing milk.

## Neverwinter Nectar

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/042_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Neverwinter nectar is an expensive but tasty spirit-based drink, known for its sweet fruit-infused flavor, buttery base, and citrus-tinged aftertaste. Perennially popular in Neverwinter, this "nectar" has gradually appeared on the drink lists of many of the finer eateries among the well-traveled cities of the Sword Coast. The surprisingly crisp and refreshing cocktail is so rich in flavor, it is often consumed in lieu of dessert or as an accompaniment to lighter fare. Veteran barkeeps unlock the full spectrum of flavors when they combine the unique mixture of juices, brandy, and white wine with a touch of sparkling water and ice. Felzoun's Folly, in Waterdeep, serves one of the more notable iterations of this syrupy and perfectly divine concoction.

## Butternut Beer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/043_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

As most adventurers know, there are serious spirits, hard liquors, and courage-enhancing brews that serve to bolster one's resolve before a trip down the well into the Undermountain. The drink known as butternut beer is none of these things. Instead, it is a sweetened and mirthful beverage best served as a dessert for a hearty meal or after a long day's night exploring Halaster's lair. Although it packs enough bourbon and butterscotch schnapps to rattle the senses, it is not intended to impair judgment. Rather, it's meant to encourage a hearty belly laugh and dull the aches of an adventurer's knotted muscles.
