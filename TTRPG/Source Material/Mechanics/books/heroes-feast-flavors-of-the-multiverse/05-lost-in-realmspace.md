*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 95*

> 
> Another fallen comrade, another Total Planning Katastrophe, and only myself to blame. The dagger of fate indeed cuts deep. Whilst our time with Bri'An was short, somehow his death stings most profoundly.
> 
> He was a dragon among men, a man among dragons. I pray he restèth in the house of Tyr, but my bitter goblin intuition tells me otherwise. I commit a portion of this Ruby Cordial (not to be confusèd with Ruby) to the Astral Sea in your honor, and now I sip its cherried juices.
> 
> Meanstwhile, the bronze-armored little man called Dint has set us sail to places unknown. Whatmatter. I again lead the Bureau toward certain death and without a healer no less. I am no leader. A poet, surely, but a leader? My plans know only failure. Only the promised glint of Astral Diamonds keepeth me going. Oh, how I long to return to my homeland, the soothing Caves of Calmness, with sweet Ruby and to hang up my adventuring leathers for good.

> 
> I don't understand it. *Volo's Guide to Bodily Health* says that Bri'An's symptoms were those of sour health and worsening humors. I did what it said and applied last-minute leeches to administer a bloodletting, and even screamed at the leeches to suck faster! But you could see on their tired, defeated little faces that they couldn't drain away the poison fast enough to save him! They were too late. I was too late.... I'm always too late. Not fast enough, not strong enough.
> 
> Oh, that I could smite the poison, smash it, but I am no more a healer than I am a fighter. I'm sorry, honest and faithful Bri'An. You deserved better and we failed you.
> 
> I now must eat the saltiest of Breaded Bird Cutlets and Beluir Poached Salmon that Dint keeps aboard to replenish the salts that have leaked from my eyes.
> 
> I will never be a real fighter.

> 
> I am troubled this day. What if Squirladax is right and there's nothing after death?
> 
> No. No, it cannot be. Even now, the Raven Queen awaits me in the Shadowfell, pleased with her newest prize: the fresh soul of a dragonborn cleric delivered upon the raven I sent from Krynn. Or I thought I spied a nearby raven, did I not?! Even as I whispered to Bri'An the words I learned from the Lords of Shadow's Edge...?
> 
> Shadow's Edge.
> 
> I have a confession to make, cursed reader. For I was cast out and banished from the Shadow's Edge Academy. I know that death **will** come for me; for I know that great spell powers and other adventuring grits are beyond my prowess for only I know that I am a Shadow's Edge drop-out.
> 
> It's not all for my fault. BETRAYED I was, and by my good friend, and fellow, if jealous, student!
> 
> And so too are you, Bri'An, betrayed...by my incompetence. What betrayals did you hide, Bri'An?
> 
> Before we committed his soulless corpse to the fertile grounds of Solamnia, we performed the rite of Journey's End—that is, we cleared it of all effects. Curiously, upon his scaled figure he carried a modest, but not insubstantial cache of wealth: rings of gold, a jeweled medallion, and trinkets of silver. He even carried blades. I've never known a cleric to carry such items. But no matter. Bri'An was jolly. Bri'An was good...if Bri'An was even his real name.

> 
> We've now been hours in this sea of astralness, but my spirits have begun to lighten (as has my head due to the copious amounts of Ruby Cordial).
> 
> The bronze-plate-hidden gnome called Dint has advised that we, the "Quaternate Tetrad," are to be the guests of honor at a grand feast at a luxurious castle called Ravenloft, where we are to deliver the wine, Veneno '18. Finally, the end of a successful quest! I know not this Ravenloft, but it sounds lofty and prestigious.
> 
> Dint has already shown us a most florid invitation, written in practiced calligraphy, which bodes that this may be the most extraordinary meal of our lives, with a dessert of FIVE ASTRAL DIAMONDS! If only...if only there were more of us to enjoy it.

> I must improve the disposition and torso shape of these humanoids with an excessive meal. Their figures mussssst be modmodified ffffor maximum nnnnnutrient density. Once dispatched to RRRRR-Ravenloft, I shall run a diagnostic as I appear appear to be malfunctioning.

> 
> Dint cooks?! The deck of the Dashor was splayed with an endless and delightful repast of morsels that threatened to burst my goblin tum! It was a bloodthemed meal, I must guess, in honor of the blood shed by dear Bri'An—a memorial supper. Oh, the flavors! The Blood of Vol was a fireball of flavors as was a dish called Thrakel-Seared Beef in Red Sauce. This runny red meal paired perfectly with more Ruby Cordial. We engorged and imbibed, welcoming with open arms the food-and-booze-induced coma that was fated us.

> That dinner was freaking insane. I can barely move. Even my leeches are fat. I am worried about Dint, though. Did he always have a limp? And fall down a lot? And nap in the middle of sentences?

## Beluir Poached Salmon

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/089_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Known as the unofficial capital of the former halfling nation of Luiren, Beluir was well regarded for its friendly folk, its strategic port location, and, of course, its food. The city's proximity to forests, rich farmland, and the sea made it an obvious destination for chefs and diners from across the Realms. And few dishes stood out more than Beluir's famous poached salmon. Available at virtually any eating house in town, the most traditional preparation came from the Friendly Burrow tavern, which created a mouthwatering spread, comprising both fresh and smoked salmon, herbs, cream cheese, and a touch of cayenne, served atop a baguette with a sprinkle of capers. If you couldn't get into the Friendly Burrow (it was always packed), the Cold Duck Inn made a worthy representation, and they even had rooms for rent that could accommodate "tall folk" guests who needed a rest after all that dining. While Luiren is no more, this famous dish can still be found on board various halfling-crewed spelljammers who commandeered this dish as their own.

## Black Lotus Root

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/090_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

There is one curriculum rarely discussed at Strixhaven University—feasting. But with offerings at the school's refectories as eclectic as its student body, aspiring mages from across the multiverse are exposed to exotic, colorful, and delicious meals to keep their learning minds inspired. At the Bow's End Tavern, a popular campus eatery, one culinary rite of passage is the pickled Black Lotus Root. This earthy yet tangy treat is an addictive nibble, notorious for turning the tongues of those who eat it purple. First years often flash their lilac tongues on campus like a badge of courage. Notably, Black Lotus Root pairs well with nearly any of the colorful (and alchemical) concoctions on tap.

## Green Dragon Blackbread Muffins

Blackbread is a palm-size circular loaf of pumpernickel that demands to be served warm and topped with sweet butter. A base of stone-ground cornmeal, dark rye flour, and a dash of unsweetened cocoa bolster the dark colors and texture. Buttermilk, molasses, and dark brown sugar round out this versatile bread with an almost honeyed nuance, which dips nicely in surplus gravy. You aren't doing it right unless a sizable slab of salted yak butter or the like is slathered on top to melt into its deep, dark nooks. A fancier version, usually served as a meal in itself, has currants or dried fruits rolled in, providing an even chewier and heartier experience. Blackbread is often sold in loaves by the bunch, but they are equally delectable in a portable muffin form, as they are served at the Green Dragon Inn in the Free City of Greyhawk. Blackbread's versatility makes it a great day starter reheated in a skillet, with—you guessed it—additional butter glistening atop. A notable version of this exists in loaf form in Saltmarsh and its nautical outskirts. In truth, whether eaten from a loaf or as a muffin, it's a classic and frugal dark bread that finds its way into many a larder.

## Thrakel-Seared Beef in Red Sauce

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/093_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Despite its reputation as a puritanical theocracy, Eberron's central Khorvaire nation of Thrane has a long and storied culinary tradition. Their culinary mastery is on no greater display than during the Feast of the Silver Flame, where one dish stands above the rest: Thrakel-Seared Beef in Red Sauce. True to Thranish tradition, strips of flank steak are drowned in a tomato-based sauce with hints of ginger, soy, and garlic. Scallions and onions add some kick in this explosion of flavor renowned through Eberron.

## Ornabra

Ornabra is a hearty meal and something of a badge of honor for those who have eaten it. This dish has been served for many generations by the hard-working denizens of Purskul (the "Granary City"), a bustling and notable caravan stop inland from Athkatla, between Amn's Cloud Peak and the Small Teeth mountains in West Faerûn. Lamb and potato stew is simmered for hours, then drained before being wrapped in thick and chewy flatbread the size of a small shield. As popular with Purskul's human constituents as with its sizable half-orc population, this street food is enough to fill a humanoid belly for two meals and is commonly scooped up by on-the-go, coin-conscious caravanners along the Southern Trade Way.

## Blood of Vol

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/095_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

In the military nation of Karnath, the faith known as the Blood of Vol symbolizes the inherent divinity within all people, stressing the power and comfort of the bonds that we form in this life. Exactly how the name of that religion became attached to this Eberron dish is a bit obscure—but the first bite you take will send divine strength coursing through your veins. The egg base is chock-full of sausage, onions, bell peppers, and enough spices to purify the soul—or in some cases, make you feel the flames of damnation, if there is such a thing. Some establishments serve this with an absolutely scorching amount of pepper, and its devotees settle for nothing less.

## Breaded Bird Cutlets

No one is quite sure how this crispy and succulent breaded chicken dish has proliferated across many planets of the multiverse, but why it appears on the menus of so many eateries is blatantly obvious—it's as classic as it is delicious. Traditional preparation of this multiversal main requires tenderizing and breading the cutlets to ensure that the chicken remains soft and moist. Each thin cutlet, the size of an orc's palm, is then fried in a flash to lock in the juices. Breaded Bird Cutlets are primarily served seasoned, lathered with butter, and spritzed with lemon, although breadings and sauces can vary greatly depending on the world and the occasion. If someone in your party is feeling adventurous, order a "stack"—three sizzling cutlets on a platter—which will surely satiate even the grandest appetite.

## Halfling Game Birds

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/098_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Halflings may be small, but their love of fine food is known to be grand. It follows, then, that one of their most prized dishes would be correspondingly small of size but big on flavor, and such is the case with the dish called Halfling Game Birds. Rubbed with a secret mixture of rosemary, thyme, and lemon zest, these tasty Cornish hens are left to marinate overnight, testing the patience of many a halfling chef. When the waiting is over (almost never as long as is recommended), the birds are finally roasted at a scorching high heat to hasten them to the table where they never last long in front of eager diners. Whether Oerth, Toril, Eberron, or Krynn, these little game birds rule the roost on halfling tables across the multiverse.

## Vada's Vanilla Buns

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/099_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

For those fortunate enough to visit the Radiant Citadel, a shining and otherworldly beacon of civilization deep in the Ethereal Plane, it is a nearly unrivaled cultural experience. Much more than a crossroads for weary interplanar pilgrims seeking passage to the founding civilizations of the Material Plane, the citadel is a veritable hub of flavors and cuisine all its own. The vanilla buns sold at Vada's Otherworldly Goods, made by the famous baker and Citadel resident Vada, are a scrumptious street-treat hailing from Siabsunkoh's famed Dyn Singh Market, nicknamed the Dancing Night Market due to its ever-shifting forms and truly magical and festive nature. These delicate rolled pastries are baked in a tightly packed bundle, resulting in a freshly cooked tray that resembles a bouquet of golden flowers. Crispy on the outside and cloudlike in the middle, these vanilla-flavored morsels don't last long at Vada's, or anywhere you find them, so be sure to grab one while you can. Although the original bun is crafted from a secret family recipe, this recipe is as close to the real thing as you are going to find.

## Ray of Frost

This flavorful and strikingly cerulean concoction is said to chill its imbiber from the inside out. Named after the arcane incantation known for blasting its target with a rush of frigid energy and slowing their steps, ray of frost provides a cool option at upmarket taverns with more extensive and adventurous drink lists. Often served in a small crystal glass, Ray of Frost is an inspired blend of gin, absinthe, vermouth, and enough ice to chill even the coldest parts of Wildspace. The real challenge with this drink isn't surviving the initial icy brain-blast but surviving several glasses of it.

## Ruby Cordial

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/101_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Ruby cordial is traditionally a saccharine swill of liquefied dark cherries blended into a fortified wine from the southern Moonshae Islands, where the aperitif first originated. While any cherries will do, the cherries of choice originate from the same rustic archipelago where they ripen in the sandy island soil, which imbues them with a sweet, robust flavor. Distilling cherry stems, skins, and even pits into the liqueur activates an almost nutty layer of flavor that hits right after the initial sugary wave passes. The Blade and Stars, a tried-and-true establishment in the port city of Baldur's Gate, offers a remarkable interpretation of this offshore staple using a traditional ruby port instead of fermented Moonshae cherry juices. Even better, the Blade serves food and drink right in the guest rooms, ensuring that no one will notice just how many of these wondrous cocktails are consumed.
