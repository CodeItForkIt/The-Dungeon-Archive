# The Rock Of Bral
*Source: Heroes' Feast Flavors of the Multiverse, p. 35* 

After escaping an exorbitant bill at the YAWNING PORTAL, our heroes bravely fled the City of Waterdeep aboard a SPELLJAMMER. Hurtled through time and space to the mysterious ROCK OF BRAL, the Bureau is charged with a QUEST!"

> 
> So, the oddest event has befallen us.
> 
> Some hours after we fled the Yawning Portal—cause of an unpaid bill—we found sanctuary in the underhold of a sea vessel docked at port. As I calmed my stalwart party, a door creaked aside, and framed in dim light came to us a small, curious figure—no taller than my brother, had I one. Encased head to toe in dented bronze plate, squat and pot-bellied, this ancient lad called out in a fluty gasp.
> 
> "ARE YOU THE QUATERNATE TETRAD?"
> 
> As all wise adventurers know, when someone asks you if you are who you are NOT, you say YES.
> 
> So, I did thus. "Yes! Of course we are."
> 
> Satisfied, he answered me in rusty reverberance: "I am DINT, Autognome (what 'tis?) and captain of the Dashor (what 'er means that!), and we are running behind! Please produce the Jewel of Javanium."
> 
> And to this I answered, "We have that...not."
> 
> Bronzèd Dint tilted his head, the armored eye-slits narrowing. Just then, I could hear the shout of City Watch grow closer.
> 
> "Are you not the Quaternate Tetrad? As ordered?"
> 
> Bri'An called out, "By Tyr, what is to be won if we are?!"
> 
> Dint's rusty flute-voice grew in conspiracy, "Why, five Astral Diamonds, of course."
> 
> It was then that Bri'An, to my great shock, produced Ruby—my precious Ruby!—from a hidden flap in his holy vestments, and presented it thusly to Dint, who responded by swallowing Ruby whole! NO! Dint's eye-slits glowed red for a moment before he turned and withdrew from view.... And with a mighty groan, our vessel set sail.
> 
> I cast an incredulous eye to Bri'An who assuaged me with pious honesty that Ruby was rescued from the ground when she slipped from my leathers as we fled.
> 
> Thus, Ruby is safe, though INSIDE the gut of our strange new companion. What purpose does she serve in this bronze-armored gnome's trunk?!
> 
> The sweeping sway of the boat lulls me as I surrender to exhaustion.
>

> 
> OH MY GODS! Guys! So, I went above decks...or to the abovedecks? Whatever, I'm not nautical! Anyways, I snuck up there to do some training. As I peeked out over the stairwell, I spied that squat little bronze guy hoisting the jibs—or jibbing the hoists, whatever! Boat stuff!—until mighty, multicolored sails flexed above me. Beyond them was the craziest sky I'd ever seen; it was like breathtaking moonlight mixed with burning sunsets! WOW!
> 
> So, as I totally had questions, I stepped up to the above-deck, and FROZE. Glancing over the side of our boat...I could see...NO SEA! Only an endless sky. A little freaked out now, I paged through *Volo's Guide* to the section on "Accidental Death & Dismemberment."
> 
> Oh CRAP! WE DIED! And this...must be the AFTERLIFE!

> 
> Intrepid reader and observer of the Bureau of Dark Tables. As life goes, I have good news and—its shadowy twin—bad news. I shall start with the good news, nay, the BEST news. There is NO afterlife! Therefore I can only conclude that we are alive! The bad news? We are sailing a bewildering sea of stars toward a free-floating mountain in the sky.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Foolish bard! Squirladax blusters that there is no afterlife—how I grow eager to show him! There is most certainly an afterlife, a "Shadowfell," and THIS NOT BE IT, heathens. I questioned the Ow-Toe-Gnome Dint and have concluded that we are aboard an object known as a SPELLJAMMER. Passingly familiar with such legends, I know it to be a ship that sails the endless space between spaces. I know not where this vessel is headed, but I fear that we have jumped from the frying pan into the fire.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> 'Tis the best day of my life! We have anchored at the dizzying Rock of Bral, and Dint has relayed to me our purpose in this Realmspace metropolis sited upon a disclike asteroid. Repeat. Dint has a PURPOSE for us! A QUEST! And a REWARD for the questing. FIVE ASTRAL DIAMONDS! And, while I do not know what an Astral Diamond is worth, I do suspect that five such diamonds are worth easily FIVE TIMES as much!
> 
> We are to proceed with great covertness into the Rock of Bral's High City district, blending into the teeming throngs of bizarre creatures from myriad realms. It is at the upscale Man-o-War restaurant overlooking Lake Bral that we shall broker a deal with a barkeep known as Jack the Knife for a rare bottle of wine: Veneno 1318 DR.
> 
> For this purpose, Dint has supplied us with 200 gold pieces to exchange for the Veneno, which he assured me should be more than enough by twice!
> 
> I shall now utter words of bardic magic to the Bureau to inspire brilliant execution of our tasks.
> 
> Heed not peril, nor flame, nor fiery ends,
> 
> For wax that wanes drips through the cracks.
> 
> And if that wax shall whack thee back,
> 
> A seal of greatness upon your slacks.
> 
> You wear the pants of your own destiny, my friends.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> Squirladax has again "inspired us" with his poetry. I've heard more inspirational things coming from the Yawning Portal's outhouse.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> I have advised it is Tyr's wisdom that we split the party, along with the gold, so as to double our chances of success! Squirladax agrees. I have taken young Sasha under my wing. She bid that I keep my sharp dragoneyes open for a supply of live leeches, and thus I seek these. However, Tyr's holiest crap! The Tamarind Balls and Loaf Pudding in the Great Market are prodigious. Seriously. Alas, a miracle of flavors sent straight from Tyr!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> Great news! Bri'An has returned with the leeches! Per the instructions from *Volo's Guide to Bodily Health*, I have applied Bri'An's leeches to my temples as a means of cooling my overhot head, allowing me to "stay cool under the pressures of combat." Bri'An has also purchased HFFotM and HFFotM, which, once eaten, will improve my swimming and breath bellow capacity. I'm going to be in the best shape of my life! We eat! As do the leeches!
>

> 
> As I wander this floating ball of mud with Squirladax, my brain shrinks as the "Goblin Poet" barrages me with castigations regarding previous failures. He is obsessed!
> 
> "I need you to casteth spells of great destruction upon our enemies," he spittles! Of course, he knows nothing from whence my power was forged. Nothing of the furnaced heats of Shadow's Edge Academy, nor its Lords who smelted my very soul.
> 
> I've always known my life would be cleavèd short, but now I know by whom.

> After a happy confabulation with Deelia concerning strategerie, we are arrivèd at the Man-o-War, indeed a place of high society...and extraordinary foods! After sampling the Tavern Noodles and a crispy skewerèd fish dish called the Tears of Selûne (to blend in), we finally made contact with Jack the Knife. A mightily tall, barrel-chested orc in a smock of chain mail—charming fellow, he! The Veneno '18 taunts me from its place of honor behind the bar on the highest shelf, and it could already have been mine this instant, were it not for.... WAIT! Greedy meanderings!
> 
> Our pious cleric Bri'An has spent down our moneys! To load down his draconic paunch, n'doubt! When I ask for reasonings from him, all I receive in return is a drunken burble that smelt of expensive Undermountain Alurlyath drink!
> 
> This is inexcusable! We are on a QUEST!
> 
> As we HAD twice the moneys, now reduced to but half the moneys needed, I must devise a solution. Think, Squirladax, think! THAT'S IT! I shall use charismatic diplomacy to charm the price of the Veneno '18 by HALF! Brilliant! Now where is Jack the Knife?!
> 
> Strange. There he be, behind the bar...but squatter, rounder, and decidedly less orcish...more draconic than I remember.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)
> 
> It is nothing short of remarkable how we have managed to turn a simple wine purchase into a...I'm not even sure what this is.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Sasha.webp#center)
> 
> Bri'An bet me I couldn't choke out that Jack the Knife guy. Ha! I showed him. It wasn't easy as he almost slipped out of my buttered arms, and I only pray that his stiff neck will benefit from the effects of the butter treatment when he awakes. Wait. Why is Bri'An stripping him bare?
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/BriAn.webp#center)
> 
> TYR be PRAISED! I have braised the beefs of success this day with the gravy of cleverness. 'Tis Tyr that whispered thusly to me. Said he, "Bri'An. Bri'An, my most devout. Hammer thy kitchen staff to unconsciousness with thy sap. Bring thy chainmail smock of Jack the Knife to thy chin and wear'st thou so that thy identity be transformèd to that of he who is chokèd by holy sister Sasha." And whence he dropped out from under Sasha's buttered embrace, so did I do'st this thing Tyr commanded me.
> 
> Disguised thusly as Jack of the Knife, I reached—in plain sight of all—for thy sweet bottle of Veneno '18.
> 
> But alas, Tyr granted me strength, but not arm length-th.
> 
> So then did I LEAP, and a great CRASHING of bottles and glass did crunch beneath my sandaled feet! But Veneno.... Ah! I seized Veneno to mine bosom.
> 
> It was then that a fountain of flame spewed forth from the hands of Deelia causing the patrons to cower beneath tables.
> 
> "TYR, GUIDE ME," I called out!
> 
> And it was in that moment that much purifying fire washed over the Man-o-War. Was this of right or wrong, who can say? But Tyr granted me speed as I fled the cindered cries!
> 
> Tyr be praised. I am parched!
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Delia.webp#center)

> I was trying to incinerate Bri'An for his blundering incompetence, but alas, he is dragonborn and more than a bit fire resistant.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Squirladax.webp#center)
> 
> My bardic tongue is speechless. It has been an hour since our return to the Dashor and our return to this crazy wild...space. I will now hand this quill over to Dint for I shall be damned to repeat what I just witnessed.
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/Dint.webp#center)
> 
> Hello! I am Dint. I am repeating what he just witnessed. Why is this Veneno freshly uncorked? Why are there dribbles of red wetness on the tabard of the dragonborn? Did one of you drink this?

> Veneno is poisonous to all but the undead.

## Fried Soy with Vegetables

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/049_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

This soy-based protein dish originated from a gnome recipe, but it is equally popular with those who shy away from animal meat, including some communities of elves. It is also ideal in environments where livestock is harder to keep, such as the Underdark and the Rock of Bral. The original gnome version uses chicken broth as a base, but vegetable broths work just as well. While the tofu is the star, the mélange of scallions, bok choy, bell pepper, and carrots imparts a variety of textures and flavors. Rice-based cooking wine and soy sauce make it a lustrous and savory meal.

## Tavern Noodles

While the flavorful plate simply known as tavern noodles is a common dish throughout the multiverse, the version on offer in the various watering holes across the Rock of Bral is truly otherworldly. The noodles themselves are rumored to be the mouth tentacles of the catfish found in the deepest depths of Lake Bral. The truth of this is impossible to ascertain. What's less obscure is how delicious this dish is, especially when drenched in a light sauce made with rosemary, garlic, onion, and white wine, as they do at the Man-o-War restaurant in the Rock of Bral's High City. Whether by magic or mischief, these noodles are sure to satisfy even the most space-weary explorers.

## Tamarind Balls

For those seeking sugary baubles to brighten the palate, do not neglect the sour yet sweet tamarind balls that festoon the market stalls of Trademeet and the areas surrounding Firedrake Bay in the lands of Faerûn. From Amn to Calimshan to Tashalar, these tasty morsels made of tamarind pulp and dates are a much beloved dessert and trail-side snack. Some of the finest examples exist a few miles to the south of Trademeet in Mosstone, at the venerable Drover's Last Drink, where they add a bit of vanilla and large-crystal sugar to the mix. These treats travel well, and spelljammer captains docking at Baldur's Gate have brought them to the Rock of Bral and beyond, where they are much sought after by astral elves, giff, and even space clowns.

## Trencher Bread

Predating even the most rustic plates, trencher bread served as a functional, and edible, tool for serving food. Usually allowed to harden and become stale, this flat, round loaf can not only hold the meal but also become the next course once the edible "plate" has absorbed any juices or sauce and softened. Even when civilization along the Sword Coast advanced, the pre-Netherese tradition of serving food on edible plates remained. No longer used for pure utility, trencher bread is traditionally prepared hard, flat, and dry, but it is lightly salted and seasoned to make the "second course" more appealing. It has also taken on other shapes, notably a bowl, which has become a popular vessel for serving soups and stews. The bread is served along the crowded, cobbled lanes of major metropolises as far south as Calimport and as distant as the Rock of Bral asteroid spaceport. Look for street vendors in Middle City's Great Market serving rare mammalian meats and sauces on this bread—a quick and cheap option for on-the-move off-worlders—and embrace the novelty of an ancient taste of Toril.

## Tears of Selûne

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/054_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

The bustling pedestrian pathways that etch the Rock of Bral are known for their prodigious offerings of finger foods. One such treat that garners all the accolades from the "locals" is a dish called the Tears of Selûne, a spicy, spit-roasted crispy fish, which came into fashion as a quick, crunchy snack that you can eat off a stick. Typically made with a firm white fish, like sea bass, the secret weapon of these delicacies is said to be the seasoning—a tantalizing mix of paprika, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Today, you can sample these crispy treats throughout the Rock of Bral. Some street chefs fry them in a skillet, though connoisseurs insist the open flame yields the best texture. Whichever way you cook them, these fish skewers are best served with a starchy base, such as warm rice, to help all the delectable textures and savory flavors go down just right.

## Duergar Smoked Herring

To many duergar, dwarves of the Underdark, food is simply the nourishment needed to get back to work. But the duergar are also renowned craftsmen, and what they do, they do well, which includes cooking a small but reliable menu of staples. And perhaps no duergar food is more prized than their smoked herring. While the original boasts herring from the dangerous depths of Darklake, known for imbuing the fish with distinctive brine and mineral flavorings, this version utilizes herring sourced from bountiful Lake Bral, a vital repository of water located in the center of this well-populated asteroid. There is no denying that a proper subterranean brine takes especially well to heat from Underdark fire lichen, but chile peppers will suffice for those chefs cooking on the surface. A specialty of the duergar enclave at the Underdark trading post of Mantol-Derith, this maritime delicacy is much sought after, from far below the surface of Toril all the way to the otherworldly Rock of Bral.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HFFotM/055_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

## Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/056_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

It is said, "When in space, do as spacefarers do," and this can prove useful advice when talking about food. One will never know how, or why, pork became such a readily available source of protein on the Rock of Bral, but that mystery is beside the point when a steaming bowl of spiced pork and orange peppers is on offer. In truth, the underside of the one-mile-long ovaloid asteroid, founded by humanoid Captain Bral, serves as a sustainable and farmable ecosystem capable of oxygen production. It even contains a freshwater lake (Lake Bral), frequently refilled by water harvested from ice asteroids, and, yes, livestock in the form of swine. Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers was a favorite of the famed Captain Bral and has remained a signature dish on the menu of the Laughing Beholder, run by gregarious beholder Large Luigi, and other notably unsavory eateries that dot the avenues of this lawless asteroid outpost. When ordered "the Captain's way," the explosion of spices (paprika, coriander, cayenne, garlic, fennel, cumin, and some mystery space seed grown onsite) combined with the zest of the orange peppers is like a peg-legged dohwar kick straight to the taste buds.

## Steak of the Deep

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/059_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

According to legend, this hearty seafood steak was first prepared by homesick triton folk living among surface dwellers and eager for a nostalgic taste of their undersea home. Guardians of the deep, commonly clustered around ocean trenches and far from the eyes and reach of humankind, triton have increasingly emerged from self-imposed isolation to cohabit with the other peoples of the multiverse. A satisfying synthesis of tastes that borrows more from the surface world than from the seafloor, steak of the deep features a thick slab of braised swordfish, topped with a simmered tomato-based blend of onion, garlic, paprika, and a crisp dry sherry, yielding a fragrant and filling main course. While you won't find this in many triton settlements proper, it is a mainstay meal for well-traveled triton and is increasingly available at larger coastal taverns and, occasionally, the more far-flung spaceports of Realmspace.

## Green Ice Rime

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/060_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

These chilly, wobbly, delicious squares of bright green jelly have become popular anywhere the people of the multiverse might need a refreshing and whimsical dessert, including the Rock of Bral where the natural refrigeration of Realmspace makes preparation a cinch. They are most often served in saucers on a bed of ice to keep them the ideal temperature. They have been nicknamed "the Gelatinous Cube" by some adventurers and there are confectioners who will suspend little candy swords or shields in the mix as a crunchy surprise that hits you right in the sweet tooth. The best part is that Green Ice Rime dissolves in your tummy...not the other way around.

## Loaf Pudding

The Elfsong Tavern of Baldur's Gate is known for many things: the disembodied singing voice of an elven maiden for which the tavern is named; the stuffed baby beholder over the mantle; and the driftglobe-lit taproom. But there is no better reason to visit this famous haven for adventurers than its delectable Loaf Pudding. A specialty of halfling head-chef Chenna Fatrabbit and her human pastry sidekick, Klav Martilmur, this moist, yogurt-infused loaf is soaked in a delicious vanilla-almond syrup and topped with a sprinkle of salted almonds to add just the right amount of crunch. The dessert is so coveted that even Spelljammer pirates have occasionally dropped into port to bring a loaf or two back to Realmspace.

## Undermountain Alurlyath

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HFFotM/064_NEWM_9781984861313_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Imported to the Rock of Bral by the barrel directly from the notorious dungeon called Undermountain, Undermountain Alurlyath is a sweet sherry wine made by desperate gnomish vintners that skulk about the mad vined halls of the dungeon. It is said that the grapes that grow in the labyrinth hold the secrets of the successful romance of flavors, and that a glass of genuine Undermountain Alurlyath, bursting with notes of honey and cucumber, will enchant its imbiber with the gift of supernatural confidence—a phenomenon known as the silver glow. Yet others hold the belief that this is, in fact, a fancy term for the growing false confidence that comes with drink.
