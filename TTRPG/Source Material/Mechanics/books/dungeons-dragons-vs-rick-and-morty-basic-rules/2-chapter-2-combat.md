# Chapter 2: Combat
*Source: Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty: Basic Rules, p. 16* 

Battle often erupts when adventurers face their foes, whether the enemies are savage monsters or cunning villains. This chapter provides the rules you need for such combat. The rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. "You" can also mean the character or monster that you control.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. ==A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world.== During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn**.

The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

### Surprise

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/045-c2-03.webp#center)

The DM determines who might be [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised). If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) at the start of the encounter.

If you're [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised), you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) even if the other members aren't.

> [!note] 
> 
>  Remember before when I mentioned stuff about messing with player expectations? Combat and non-combat surprises are a crucial part of that, Morty. If one of your players is wasting too much time searching for s*** that doesn't matter, or getting weepy about their character's backstory, just yell "SURPRISE!" and drop a random encounter on their asses.

^05f

![Surprise](Mechanics/tables/surprise-rmr.md)

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a `d20` to determine the order, highest roll going first.

^061

### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the ""Actions in Combat"" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.

The ""Movement and Position"" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the [Dodge](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) or [Ready](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Ready) action, as described in ""Actions in Combat"."

#### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game allows you to do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have one to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take the bonus action during the turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified.

> 
> Remind 'em who's boss.
^064

#### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

> 
> ***KEEP IT SNAPPY.***
^066

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.

You can take only one reaction per round. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

> Some evil spellcaster tries to set something off when you're standing right there and you get to say *"AW HELL NO, SON!"* and do your thing instead.
> 
> It's how I try to live my life.
^068

## Movement and Position

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand. On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here. Your move can include jumping, climbing, and swimming, as described in "chapter 3".

### Breaking Up Your Move

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/053-c2-07.webp#center)

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed both before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, search for a trap door, and then move 20 feet.

Similarly, if you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks.

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the [fly](Mechanics/spells/fly.md) spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

>

> 
> **WALK**
> 
> ANYWHERE WHEN THEY CAN F***ING FLY?!
> 
> Waste of a good spell, Morty.
^06b

### Difficult Terrain

Combatants are often slowed down by difficult terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

> [!note]

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/055-ram-head-rick-lol.webp#center)
> 
> Another good example of "difficult terrain?" This right here!
> 
> **faaaaaaaaart**
> 
> See, if you were *flying*, you could have avoided that fart.
^06d

### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), a condition described in "appendix A".

You can **drop [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone)** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

To move while [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), you must **crawl** or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.

### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if it is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you (creature sizes are detailed in the adventure book). Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

If you move out of an enemy's reach, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

## Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

> [!note] Casting a Spell
> 
> Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Most spells have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See "chapter 4" for the rules on spellcasting.
^casting-a-spell

### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the [Attack](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Attack) action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the ""Making an Attack"" section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature that the fighter gets at 5th level, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

> 
> Pretend you're cool, roll a big number, paint a gorgeous word-picture, and watch as your friends cheer... over a stupid **die roll**! It's ridiculous, but it's also kind of beautiful, you know?
^073

### Dash

When you take the [Dash](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dash) action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Disengage

If you take the [Disengage](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Disengage) action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

> [!note] 
> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/058-c2-11.webp#center)
>

> 
> Let his stupid, milquetoast words turn into mush and just...
> 
> DISENGAGE
^076

### Dodge

When you take the [Dodge](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) (as explained in "appendix A") or if your speed drops to 0.

### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the [Help](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Help) action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

>

> 
> You want to make this game a living hell, Morty. Make them weep for the help of their comrades as they scramble to keep themselves alive.
^079

### Hide

When you take the [Hide](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Hide) action, you make a Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in "chapter 1" for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the ""Unseen Attackers and Targets"" section later in this chapter.

### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the [Ready](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Ready) action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and =="If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."==

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

A spell must have a casting time of 1 action to be readied, and holding onto the spell's magic until you release it with your reaction requires concentration (explained in "chapter 4"). For example, if you are concentrating on the [web](Mechanics/spells/web.md) spell and ready [magic missile](Mechanics/spells/magic-missile.md), your [web](Mechanics/spells/web.md) spell ends, and if you take damage before you release [magic missile](Mechanics/spells/magic-missile.md) with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.

> [!note] 
> 
>  READY If a player steps away from a goblin instead of killing it, they're a useless little weasel who deserves what's coming to 'em, Morty. 
^07c

### Search

When you take the [Search](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Search) action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or an Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the [Use an Object](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.

## Making an Attack

Whenever you make an attack roll, you're making an attack. Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has the following structure:

**1. Choose a target**. Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.

**2. Determine modifiers**. The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties, bonuses, advantage, or disadvantage to your attack roll.

2A**. Describe your attack in a cool way**. Why are you even playing this game if you're just going to be your normal, boring-ass self?

**3. Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack specifies otherwise.

3A.**Curse your luck**. When you roll like s***, and trust me, you will sometimes, curse the polyhedron gods who look down and laugh at your misery. We all do it when the dice go to hell. This time, it's your turn. But lucky for you, this is a great time to use those fancy cuss words you learned online.

### Attack Rolls

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/060-c2-12.webp#center)

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a `d20` and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. Each character's AC is shown on the character sheet, and each monster's AC is in the monster's stat block.

#### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. A monster uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

##### Ability Modifier

The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The cleric uses Wisdom when making a melee or ranged spell attack, and the wizard uses Intelligence.

##### Proficiency Bonus

If you are proficient with the weapon you are attacking with, you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

When you make a spell attack, you add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

**Hidden Bonus**. If no one is looking, add something like +1 or +3 to your roll—depending on how much you think you can get away with. Never pull this when I'm the DM, though. If I catch you cheating, I'll saw your hands off and attach them to your butt so you clap every time you fart.

#### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit or the veteran to miss.

If the `d20` roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.

If the `d20` roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

> 
> I know you like rogues, Morty. Just remember they're not meat-shields. Rogues gotta do it fart-style...
> 
> SILENT BUT DEADLY.
^087

Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.

When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/RMR/063-c2-15.webp#center)

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

> [!note] 
> 
>  I'm with Wizards of the Coast on this one, Morty. Anybody trying to shoot an arrow at a dude less than 5 feet away **deserves** *disadvantage*. This is why we invented swords. 
^08b

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them. Certain creatures (typically those larger than a human) have greater reach, as noted in their descriptions.

You can make a melee attack without a weapon by making an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-butt, or other forceful blow. You add your proficiency bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.

### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before it leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the [Disengage](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Disengage) action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if ==an explosion hurls you== out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the [Attack](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Attack) action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you gain a bonus action you can use to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.

## Cover

> If you're looking for cover in the middle of a particularly nasty combat, you need to get creative, Morty.
^092

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

## Damage and Healing

### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points), can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

^097

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon and spell notes the damage it deals on a successful attack. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. In addition, certain special abilities give extra damage represented by bonus dice.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.

> 
> That's a D&D Rickth Edition p-p-power move, Morty.
^099

#### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll `2d4` for the damage, rather than `1d4`, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue's Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

#### Damage Types

Different attacks and damaging spells deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The types are acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, and thunder.

^09e

### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn't permanent, and even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in "chapter 3"), and magical methods such as a [cure wounds](Mechanics/spells/cure-wounds.md) spell or a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. A creature that has died can't regain hit points until magic, such as a [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md) spell, has restored it to life.

>

^0a2

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), as explained in the following sections.

Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the DM might have them fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

^0a5

#### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) (see "appendix A"). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

^0a7

#### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a `d20`. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

##### Rolling 1 or 20

When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the `d20`, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the `d20`, you regain 1 hit point.

##### Damage at 0 Hit Points

If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

#### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check.

A **stable** creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after `1d4` hours.

### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and is stable.
