# Appendix A: Conditions
*Source: Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty: Basic Rules, p. 62* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.
