To the mages and scholars of the Tolarian Academies, magic is one science among many. Their books of lore contain eldritch runes as well as elaborate equations, and they employ complex constructs alongside enchanted golems. What happens to bronze if you transmute the tin it contains into iron after smelting? Does introducing an electrical charge enhance the scrying ability of a [crystal ball](Mechanics/items/crystal-ball.md)? To the Tolarians, there's nothing strange or even interdisciplinary about these questions—even if the answer in either case could easily turn out to be: "It explodes."

## Heroes of Tolaria

Students of magic come from all over Dominaria to the Tolarian Academies, and both the student body and the faculty reflect this. People of virtually every intelligent species on the plane can be found somewhere among the Tolarians, and students and faculty might hail from any of the plane's human cultures.

### Suggested Classes

Tolaria is a [wizard](Mechanics/classes/wizard.md) school, and virtually everyone at the Academy—students, teachers, scholars, and administrators alike—is a wizard skilled in or learning the practice of magic. Professors within each academy can trace their educational history back to different members of the original Tolarian Academy, including Urza, Barrin, and Rayne. Members of different lineages typically focus on different subjects, employ different teaching styles, adhere to different ethical standards, use different jargon, and even adopt distinct accents when addressing students. At least in theory, members of other classes can study at the Tolarian Academies, though some amount of magical talent is a requirement for entry. An eldritch knight or arcane trickster might learn magic there while honing other skills, or a sorcerer might try to elevate the mastery of their innate abilities through rigorous arcane study.

## Tolarian Adventures

Students and scholars at the Tolarian Academies are engaged in a tremendous range of research, providing a fertile field for adventures. Magical mishaps, wonderful discoveries, mages driven mad by power, and forbidden research can all provide starting points for adventures dealing with the Academies.

### Tolarian Quests

Characters who are associated with the Tolarian Academies might be students, who are often sent on dangerous assignments in order to pass a class or advance in rank through the schools' three-tiered system of levels. Or they might instead be teachers, scholars, or researchers whose work draws them into unexpected danger.

### Tolarian Sites

The two Tolarian Academies in the Domains are Tolaria West, in the northwestern Spice Isles; and the Academy at Orvada on the island of Walassa to the east—part of the mercantile Orvadan Empire. Each Academy is a small city in its own right, and both offer plentiful adventure opportunities. Other locations involved in Tolarian adventures are likely to be places of heightened magical activity (past or present), which often draw the attention of students or faculty. The Tolarian Sites table provides some examples.

### Tolarian Villains

Most Tolarian wizards are drawn to knowledge for its own sake, or actively try to use magic to make the world a better place. Some are dedicated to keeping dangerous magic out of the hands of those who would use it for selfish or evil ends. But a rare few members of the Academies are inevitably drawn to use magic to dominate, plunder, and destroy—and these wizards make extremely dangerous villains. The Tolarian Villains table offers some examples.
