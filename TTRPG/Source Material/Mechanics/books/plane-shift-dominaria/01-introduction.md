> By the time you read this, you'll have heard news of the forthcoming publication of "Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica", which I privately refer to as "Plane Shift: Ravnica." That book is the primary reason that this installment of the Plane Shift series is relatively late, because the D&D part of my brain was occupied with working on it. But that book is also the culmination of all the work I've done on this series over the last couple of years. Plane Shift—and your overwhelmingly positive response to it—paved the way for the hardcover Ravnica book, by proving that a D&D/Magic crossover was something that people wanted to see. So your delight and enthusiasm for this pet project is directly responsible for the "Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica" coming later this year. Thank you!

> When I started working on the D&D team at Wizards of the Coast in 2000, there was already some talk of doing a crossover product between D&D and Magic: The Gathering. At the time, Magic was more or less synonymous with the world of Dominaria. So in a way, this installment of the Plane Shift series is over eighteen years in the making.

> This work isn't comprehensive, of course. As always, *The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Dominaria* is the definitive resource, but even that book could only scratch the surface of Dominaria. The art book was built on the world guide, and the world guide specifically chose ten regions of the world—two per mana color—as a focus for the card set. Of those ten regions, seven are either located on or around the continent of Aerona or have a significant impact on it. For that reason, I made the decision in this article to focus on the Domains, omitting the regions of Urborg, Shiv, and Yavimaya. I figured that leaving those out would diminish the temptation for characters to circumnavigate a globe that includes so many regions already omitted from the art book. That said, the art book includes a complete map, and the Internet is home to abundant information about Dominaria (especially on the Magic Website (https://magic.wizards.com/en)). So if you want to expand your campaign beyond Aerona, you should have little trouble doing so.

> There's not a lot of rules content in this article, largely because Dominaria is as close as Magic comes to the classic fantasy that D&D draws from. Feel free to make extensive use of class options, monsters, and other parts of the fifth edition D&D rules (which you can find here (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)).

> Once more, thanks for showing so much support for the Plane Shift series, and for making possible the even more exciting projects to come!

> The game mechanics in this supplement are usable in your D&D campaign but are not fully tempered by playtests and design iterations. For these reasons, material in this supplement is not legal in D&D Organized Play events.
