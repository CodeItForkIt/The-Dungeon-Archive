Gracefully curved towers float in a golden sky, so serene that not even gravity can touch them. Devout priests sing beautiful songs of veneration. Winged angels fly through the air on their way to bring gentle comfort to the needy and swift justice to the cruel. This is the Church of Serra, a benevolent religion founded to honor the memory and example of its goddess.

## Heroes of Serra

Belying the appearance of a monolithic order at the center of the church, dozens of officially recognized clerical and knightly orders within it keep peculiar traditions dating back centuries. Each order counts an array of angels, clerics, and knights among its adherents.

- **Alignment.** Usually lawful good  
- **Races.** [Human](Mechanics/races/human.md), [Aven](Mechanics/races/aven-psd.md)  
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Acolyte](Mechanics/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [Hermit](Mechanics/backgrounds/hermit.md), [Sage](Mechanics/backgrounds/sage.md), [Soldier](Mechanics/backgrounds/soldier.md)  

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options when playing a Serran character.

#### Cleric

Many different ranks of priests fill the church hierarchy, but they all serve the same essential functions of ministering to the populace and interpreting the teachings of Serra. Priests who go out into the world and spread Serra's word are known as missionaries. As a cleric of Serra, you can choose from the [Knowledge](Mechanics/classes/cleric-knowledge-domain.md), [Life](Mechanics/classes/cleric-life-domain.md), [Light](Mechanics/classes/cleric-light-domain.md), and [War](Mechanics/classes/cleric-war-domain.md) domains.

#### Monk

Monks are true believers who devote their lives to understanding Serra's word rather than preaching it. Some focus on contemplation, study, and the healing arts, but others find their deep wisdom by way of martial practice.

#### Paladin

Even within the peaceful Church of Serra, some are called to fight. Soldiers (called acolytes and guardians) serve a largely ceremonial function, protecting the cathedrals of Serra. But paladins are more worldly, venturing out across the land in search of evil to defeat. Serran paladins typically swear the [Oath of Devotion](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-devotion.md). Those who are devoted to the Four Virtues of art, discourse, freedom, and peace are more apt to swear the [Oath of the Ancients](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-ancients.md).

> [!note] Serra Angels
> 
> The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angels—both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.
> 
> Any of the angels in the "Monster Manual" can serve as [Serra angels](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/serra-angel-psd.md). The [deva](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) represents the most common angels, while the [planetar](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) and [solar](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/solar.md) are appropriate for powerful angels such as [Lyra](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lyra-psd.md) and [Shalai](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/shalai-psd.md).

## Serran Adventures

As a major force for good in the world, the Church of Serra is more likely to act as a patron for heroic adventurers than as an adversary. That said, even the most well-meaning paladin can take on a villainous nature, either out of misguided zeal or when manipulated by a sinister force. You can use the following tables to help inspire adventure ideas dealing with the Church of Serra.

### Serran Quests

Characters with ties to the Church of Serra might be sent on holy quests by priests or even angels. Alternatively, they might draw on their own pious devotion to undertake a pilgrimage—or a crusade.

### Serran Sites

Sites associated with the Church of Serra are not limited to any particular geographical area. Adventures linked to the church might take characters across the world.

### Serran Villains

The Church of Serra is markedly lacking in hypocrisy. Perhaps enough holy power suffuses the sites and relics of the church that people are truly transformed into better versions of themselves by their exposure to it. Or perhaps the church is particularly effective at rooting out corruption and false virtue before those things can exert their evil on the world in Serra's name. When adventurers find themselves opposed to a Serran, it might be for reasons like those shown on the Serran Villains table.
