# The Domains
*Source: Plane Shift: Dominaria, p. 4* 

Dominaria is an enormous plane, with numerous landmasses separated by vast oceans. This article, though, focuses on the continent of Aerona and its surrounding lands, which are collectively known as the Domains.

## Aerona

The continent of Aerona is sharply split between its northern and southern parts, with the division marked by a wide bay and a forbidding mountain range.

The southern part of Aerona is dominated by **Benalia**, the foremost mercantile and military power on Dominaria. It spreads along the western coast and out to the nearby islands, including the Isle of Avenant to the north and much of the Spice Isles to the west. Though most famous for their fertile fields, the lands of Benalia also include old-growth forests, rolling mountains, and a lengthy coastline.

The skies above Benalia are dotted with the curved, floating spires of the **Church of Serra**, with a heavy concentration of them above Benalia City. In stark contrast to the beneficence of the church, agents of **Belzenlok's Cabal** have been infiltrating Benalia from their stronghold to the east, in Urborg.

South and east of Benalia lie the impassable tangles of the **Llanowar** forest. Llanowar is populated by diverse elven societies that are threatened by the goblins and orcs of the Ironclaw Mountains.

Land passage through Benalia to the east coast of Aerona is virtually impossible thanks to the peaks of the Ironclaws, but the Benalish are the preeminent naval power in the region. By informal but frequently reiterated agreement, Benalish ships stay out of the Voda Sea, and the merfolk of **Vodalia** allow shipping to pass along Aerona's coastlines largely unhindered. This command of Aerona's southern coasts allows the Benalish to maintain a permanent presence in Sursi on the east coast of the continent.

To the northeast of Benalia are the Red Iron Mountains, which divide the more sparsely populated northern half of Aerona from the lands to the south. The mountains' native Crookshank kobolds fared poorly during the chaos of the Rift Years, and the mountains are now dotted with Benalish mining settlements.

To the east, the Red Iron Mountains divide as the continent does, with the Ironcrowns veering off to the south. The northern branch becomes the formidable peaks of the Hurloon Mountains, home of a peaceful but reclusive nation of minotaurs. The occasional Benalish trading mission ventures into Hurloon, but permanent settlements and Serran missionaries are met with open hostility.

## Icehaven

The forbidding subcontinent north of Aerona is Icehaven, home to the warrior nation of **Keld**. Keldon raiders and Benalish colonists now clash regularly along the west coast of northern Aerona, both seeking to control the relatively narrow stretch of land between the Sea of Avenant and the Whispering Woods to the east.

## Spice Isles

West of Benalia spreads a vast ocean dotted with islands. The most prominent of the **Tolarian Academies**, Tolaria West, is situated in the northwestern Spice Isles. (A second Tolarian Academy is situated on Walassa to the east of Aerona, part of the mercantile empire of Orvada.)
