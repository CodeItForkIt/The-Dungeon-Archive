Benalia is a land of natural and architectural beauty: vast fields of sun-kissed grain crisscrossed by meandering rivers and dotted with cities of white limestone towers and vivid stained glass. One would hardly guess that less than a century before, this great empire was fractured, its people scattered, and its shining capital city a salt-choked ruin. Today, the seven noble houses of Benalia once again rule one of the most prosperous and powerful nations of Dominaria. The Benalish are keenly aware that their New Benalia is in its infancy, with a thousand years of heroic ancestors and tales of bravery to live up to. But they are a diligent people—and proud enough to consider themselves equal to the task.

## Heroes of Benalia

Benalia is an empire poised for expansion, and many of its greatest heroes are part of its strong and growing array of military forces.

### Suggested Classes

Consider any of the following class options for a Benalish character.

#### Cleric

The priests who march with the armies of Benalia are consecrated by the Serran church—and are technically part of its ecclesiastical hierarchy. In practice, though, they serve more as military officers than as clergy. Benalish clerics inspire their charges to great feats of glory and heroism, bolstering them with the blessings of Serra.

#### Fighter

Benalish fighters drawn from the noble houses are often elite knights. They are responsible for security for Benalish lords and their manors, and make up the core of military forces in the field. Noble fighters also serve as officers for the soldiery, but many people from the common classes also rise to officer ranks. Each of the noble houses maintains its own standing army, but several legions of professional soldiers tithed from the different houses make up the backbone of the Benalish fighting force.

#### Paladin

Warriors who combine loyalty to Benalia with devotion to Serra might join the ranks of Benalia's knights if they come from noble blood. This is particularly true of the members of House Capashen, who have a long heritage of worshiping Serra.

#### Ranger

The leather-clad Benalish warriors known colloquially as "heroes" make up a special, renowned class of defender. They are trained from a young age to survive in any environment while operating independently, and they owe their loyalty directly to Benalia City and the Council of Seven.

## Benalish Adventures

What might bring adventurers to Benalia? What adventures can Benalish heroes undertake? And what nefarious schemes might a Benalish villain pursue? You can use the following tables for inspiration when building adventures around the people and locations of Benalia.

### Benalish Quests

Benalish characters often have ties to either the Seven Great Houses or the military forces of Benalia. They might be sent on missions by their individual houses or by the Council of Seven, when not undertaking quests driven by their own lofty ideals.

### Benalish Sites

Like much of Dominaria, Benalia is dotted with the ruins of ancient empires and scarred by long-ago wars. First built on the ashes of the ancient Sheoltun Empire, it was ravaged by the Phyrexian Invasion, then rebuilt over the rubble of its own near-destruction.

### Benalish Villains

When evil arises in the realm of Benalia, it often takes the form of that most dangerous of villains: the kind that believe themselves to be righteous and good. They might use villainous methods to advance what are basically good ends, or grow so zealous in their fight against evil that they begin to see it everywhere.
