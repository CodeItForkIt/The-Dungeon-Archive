Few outsiders dare to venture into the vast and ancient Llanowar forest, where huge old-growth trees tower a thousand feet above the ground. Among those trees live the fierce Llanowar elves, whose appearance of savagery and reputation for xenophobic hostility are enough to keep most other folk away from even the shadow of the forest. In reality, however, the Llanowar are a reclusive people, and careful visitors can enter and leave their domain without ever seeing its inhabitants. When the Llanowar elves are seen, it is because they wish to be seen—and often to an intruder's detriment.

## Heroes of Llanowar

The people of Llanowar are elves with a reputation for xenophobia, offering intruders greetings that range from quiet suspicion to swift death. Some elves are concerned primarily with their own self-preservation, and the safety of their families, villages, and elfhames. But there are others who keep their eyes on larger dangers. Some of those elves join the Order of the Steel Leaf, keeping watch on the forest's borders and occasionally venturing beyond those borders to meet threats. Others take to the wider world, pursuing foes that threaten more than just Llanowar—or simply seeking adventure.

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options for a Llanowar elf character.

#### Bard or Druid

Since the death of the elf Planeswalker Freyalise, the elves of Llanowar have turned to the worship of Gaea, the goddess of life and nature. Most believe that Freyalise was an avatar or aspect of Gaea in life—and some still pray to her, believing that she continues to take that role in death. But even the faithful of Freyalise are likely to pray directly to Gaea most days. That said, the druids of Llanowar are not just a religious order. They are a professional philosophical class, with different orders filling different social and religious roles among the elves. Some orders consist of poets, bards, and historians who collect and preserve the lore of Llanowar and its peoples for future generations. Others are made up of astronomers, mathematicians, and navigators, who use their esoteric knowledge to predict weather and astronomical events. Most importantly, the druids serve as the judicial system, both investigating complaints and judging the accused.

#### Fighter or Ranger

From kavu-riding cavalry to branch-walking archers, the elves of Llanowar are accomplished warriors who take easily to either of these classes.

## Llanowar Adventures

The most well-known cultural feature of the Llanowar elves is a reclusiveness that borders on xenophobia. This distrust has varied in its degree and harshness throughout history—and it can vary more widely among the different societies of Llanowar. Some elves conduct cautious trade at carefully patrolled border sites, while others harshly punish any transgression of their unwritten laws.

### Llanowar Quests

Many Llanowar elves dislike leaving the protective eaves of the forest. So when danger arises outside the boundaries of the wood, elfhame leaders might send the more restless young elves of their community to face the danger—or they might ask (or call in) a favor from outside adventurers.

### Llanowar Sites

The Llanowar forest teems with life—and with magic. Special locations within the forest are abundant, offering many possibilities for adventure.

### Llanowar Villains

The anger and violence of the xenophobic Llanowar elves is usually reactive—reserved for those who trespass in their forest. But the distance from reactive to active villainy is often a small step.

### Kavu

Kavu are reptilian creatures that are either very ancient or a relatively recent creation on Dominaria. Either awakening from a millennia-long hibernation or springing fully formed into being, they emerged from the ground to defend against the Phyrexian Invasion. The Llanowar elves now breed the kavu to fill a variety of roles, believing that these creatures were the goddess Gaea's means of intervening in Dominaria's defense. The close relationship between elves and kavu is a constant reminder of Gaea's beneficence. Every Kelfae bonds with an arboreal kavu companion, and some Kelfae and Basiphem warriors ride them into battle.
