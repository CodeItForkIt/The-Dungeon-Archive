> [!note] Planes and Subraces
> 
> Three of the races of Ixalan—goblins, merfolk, and vampires—are also found on Zendikar and appear in "Plane Shift: Zendikar". They are presented here as races unto themselves, but in effect, the [vampires of Ixalan](Mechanics/races/vampire-ixalan-psx.md) and the [vampires of Zendikar](Mechanics/races/vampire-zendikar-psz.md) can be treated as two subraces of the same vampire race.
> 
> The core merfolk race presented here is the same as [the one in Plane Shift: Zendikar](Mechanics/races/merfolk-psz.md), so [green](Mechanics/races/merfolk-ixalan-green-psx.md) and [blue merfolk](Mechanics/races/merfolk-ixalan-blue-psx.md) are simply additional subraces.
> 
> For vampires, these traits presented in Plane Shift: Zendikar are features of the [Zendikar subraces](Mechanics/races/vampire-zendikar-psz.md) of vampires:
> 
> - **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.  
> - **Null Transformation.** A humanoid killed with your Bloodthirst ability becomes a [null](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/vampire-null-psz.md).  
> - The Ixalan vampire's increase to Wisdom and Feast of Blood trait are features of the [Ixalan subrace](Mechanics/races/vampire-ixalan-psx.md).  
> 
> For goblins, each of the Zendikar subraces gains the following traits:
> 
> - **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2.  
> - **Grit.** You have resistance against acid and fire damage. In addition, when you are wearing no armor, your AC is equal to 11 + your Dexterity bonus.  
> - The Ixalan goblin's increase to Dexterity and Agile Climber trait are features of the [Ixalan subrace](Mechanics/races/goblin-ixalan-psx.md).
