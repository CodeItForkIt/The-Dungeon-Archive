## Sun Empire

The Sun Empire is a powerful civilization that dominates the eastern coast of Ixalan. The empire's fierce warriors are supported by priests who wield the power of the sun and command the mighty dinosaurs that inhabit the continent. A new ruler has brought the empire into an era of expansion, seeking to reclaim the lands in the continent's interior that it once held. At the same time, a foreign incursion into those same lands sparks a search for the artifact known as the Immortal Sun, which the people of the empire view as a potent symbol of their identity.

- **Races.** [Human](Mechanics/races/human-ixalan-psx.md)  
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Acolyte](Mechanics/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [entertainer](Mechanics/backgrounds/entertainer.md), [folk hero](Mechanics/backgrounds/folk-hero.md), [guild artisan](Mechanics/backgrounds/guild-artisan.md), [hermit](Mechanics/backgrounds/hermit.md), [noble](Mechanics/backgrounds/noble.md), [sage](Mechanics/backgrounds/sage.md), [soldier](Mechanics/backgrounds/soldier.md), [urchin](Mechanics/backgrounds/urchin.md)  

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options for your Sun Empire character.

#### Barbarian

Certain warriors devoted to Tilonalli (the destructive aspect of the Threefold Sun—the deity worshiped by the folk of the empire) enter a berserk rage in combat. The [Path of the Berserker](Mechanics/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-berserker.md) is appropriate for these characters, or the [Path of the Totem Warrior](Mechanics/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-totem-warrior.md) (replacing bear, eagle, and wolf totem spirits with [ceratops](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/ceratops-psx.md), [aerosaur](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/aerosaur-large-psx.md), and [raptor](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/velociraptor-mpmm.md) spirits, respectively).

#### Bard

Poetry is a respected art among the warriors of the Sun Empire, so bards of the [College of Valor](Mechanics/classes/bard-college-of-valor.md) might be found within their ranks.

#### Cleric

Sun Empire clerics are typically devoted to one particular aspect of the Threefold Sun. Kinjalli, the Wakening Sun, represents the deity's creative aspects and grants access to the [Life](Mechanics/classes/cleric-life-domain.md) and [Light](Mechanics/classes/cleric-light-domain.md) domains. Ixalli, the Verdant Sun, represents its sustaining and nourishing aspects, granting access to the [Life](Mechanics/classes/cleric-life-domain.md) and [Nature](Mechanics/classes/cleric-nature-domain.md) domains. Tilonalli, the Burning Sun, represents its destructive aspects and grants access to the [Tempest](Mechanics/classes/cleric-tempest-domain.md) and [War](Mechanics/classes/cleric-war-domain.md) domains.

#### Druid

Certain shamans of the Sun Empire are closely attuned to the forces of nature, and use wild shape to take on dinosaur forms. These druids typically follow the [Circle of the Moon](Mechanics/classes/druid-circle-of-the-moon.md).

#### Fighter

Highly trained soldiers and warriors are the backbone of the Sun Empire. They are typically [Battle Masters](Mechanics/classes/fighter-battle-master.md) or [Champions](Mechanics/classes/fighter-champion.md).

#### Paladin

Knights of the Sun Empire are drawn to the [Oath of the Ancients](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-the-ancients.md) and (increasingly, as vampires and pirates mount incursions into their lands) the [Oath of Vengeance](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-vengeance.md). These paladins often use the [find steed](Mechanics/spells/find-steed.md) spell to acquire dinosaur mounts (typically a [hadrosaurus](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/hadrosaurus-mpmm.md), described in "Volo's Guide to Monsters").

#### Ranger

Scouts of the Sun Empire are often rangers, including both [Beast Masters](Mechanics/classes/ranger-beast-master.md) and [Hunters](Mechanics/classes/ranger-hunter.md). The [pteranodon](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/pteranodon.md), [dimetrodon](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/dimetrodon-mpmm.md), and [velociraptor](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/velociraptor-mpmm.md) are all appropriate ranger's companions.

> [!note] Four Peoples, One Party
> 
> The trickiest thing about playing D&D in a highly factionalized setting like Ixalan is bringing player characters together who belong to different groups and would have no obvious reason to want to cooperate—let alone trust each other with their lives. One possibility, of course, is for all the characters to belong to the same faction. An all-vampire party bent on conquest or an all-pirate party set to explore the Stormwreck Sea can find plenty of adventure in Ixalan. But if one player is intent on playing a merfolk and one is determined to be an orc, some extra effort is required to bring them together.
> 
> The most straightforward approach is to put the characters into a situation where they need to work together to survive or to achieve some goal they all share. Necessity makes strange bedfellows, as the saying goes, and characters who find themselves in a bad situation have a strong incentive to put aside their differences and work together, at least until they get out of that situation. They might all be trapped in the same place, or each character could have something that the whole group needs.
> 
> You can roll on the following table to generate ideas for bringing characters together at the start of the campaign. Ideally, by the time they have overcome whatever circumstance has thrown them together, they will have learned to trust each other and perhaps even become friends.

> [!note] Languages
> 
> Generally, in a D&D campaign, it's a good idea to ensure that all the player characters can understand each other. That's why the game maintains the convenient fiction of a Common tongue. But Ixalan is about the clash of four cultures, so you might want to emphasize the differences among those cultures by making the folk of each speak entirely different languages.
> 
> If you go this route, Merfolk is the language of the River Heralds and Vampire is the language of the Legion of Dusk. The humans of the Sun Empire speak their own language, Itzocan, and the humans of the Brazen Coalition speak a different language—a pidgin of Orc, Siren, and a native human language that is similar to Vampire (about as closely related as Italian is to Spanish). Orcs, sirens, and goblins also speak this Brazen Coalition pidgin.
> 
> You might still wish to admit the existence of a Common Trade Pidgin—a trade pidgin used in circumstances where members of different peoples do interact with each other. But such a language is almost impossible to use for discussions of matters of any depth.

## River Heralds

The River Heralds are a collection of small, nomadic bands of merfolk who were the dominant inhabitants of Ixalan before the rise of the Sun Empire. They live in harmony with the land, and their shamans wield powerful nature magic to control the elements of wind and water. They believe that the power of the Immortal Sun is too dangerous for anyone to wield—including themselves. And so they seek to protect the golden city of Orazca and steer all intruders away from it.

- **Races.** [Merfolk (Ixalan; Blue)](Mechanics/races/merfolk-ixalan-blue-psx.md), [Merfolk (Ixalan; Green)](Mechanics/races/merfolk-ixalan-green-psx.md)  
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Acolyte](Mechanics/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [folk hero](Mechanics/backgrounds/folk-hero.md), [hermit](Mechanics/backgrounds/hermit.md), [outlander](Mechanics/backgrounds/outlander.md), [sage](Mechanics/backgrounds/sage.md)  

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options for your River Herald character.

#### Druid

Many River Herald shamans are druids of the [Circle of the Land](Mechanics/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md).

#### Fighter

The warriors among the River Heralds include cunning strategists (often [Battle Masters](Mechanics/classes/fighter-battle-master.md)), bold [Champions](Mechanics/classes/fighter-champion.md), and [Eldritch Knights](Mechanics/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md) who fuse arcane magic with their use of weapons.

#### Ranger

Other River Herald warriors wield the druidic magic of the forest in the defense of their lands.

#### Wizard

The magic of wind, mist, illusion, and misdirection is the province of River Herald wizards.

## Legion of Dusk

The society of the Legion of Dusk is built around the rites and devotion of a powerful church, led by undead paladins who sustain themselves on the blood of their enemies. After seven hundred years of war that saw them march across the entirety of their home continent, the vampires of the Legion have come to add Ixalan to their territory. Certain leaders among them also seek the Immortal Sun, which is dimly remembered in their own legends as a source of true immortality—eternal life, in contrast to the endless undeath they now endure.

- **Races.** [Vampire (Ixalan)](Mechanics/races/vampire-ixalan-psx.md), [Human (Ixalan)](Mechanics/races/human-ixalan-psx.md)  
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Acolyte](Mechanics/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [noble](Mechanics/backgrounds/noble.md), [sage](Mechanics/backgrounds/sage.md), [soldier](Mechanics/backgrounds/soldier.md), [urchin](Mechanics/backgrounds/urchin.md) (human only)  

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options for your Legion of Dusk character.

#### Cleric

Clerics of the Church of Dusk typically choose the [Death](Mechanics/classes/cleric-death-domain.md), [Life](Mechanics/classes/cleric-life-domain.md), or [War](Mechanics/classes/cleric-war-domain.md) domains.

#### Fighter

The bulk of the Legion of Dusk is made up of soldiers and knights, who might be [Battle Masters](Mechanics/classes/fighter-battle-master.md) or [Champions](Mechanics/classes/fighter-champion.md).

#### Monk

Certain vampire clerics live under strict rules of fasting, prayer, and martial discipline, and might be considered monks of the [Way of the Open Hand](Mechanics/classes/monk-way-of-the-open-hand.md) or the [Way of Shadow](Mechanics/classes/monk-way-of-shadow.md). The latter often act as agents for Queen Miralda, who rules the Legion of Dusk with an iron hand.

#### Paladin

Vampire paladins of the Legion of Dusk typically swear the [Oath of Devotion](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-devotion.md), though the tenets they follow are appropriate to their particular faith. (If you are using "Xanathar's Guide to Everything", the [Oath of Conquest](Mechanics/classes/paladin-oath-of-conquest-xge.md) is even more appropriate.)

![Legion of Dusk; Suggested Ideals](Mechanics/tables/legion-of-dusk-suggested-ideals-psx.md)

![Legion of Dusk; Suggested Bonds](Mechanics/tables/legion-of-dusk-suggested-bonds-psx.md)

> [!note] Tenets of Blood
> 
> The vampires of the Legion of Dusk can hardly be considered good, but they do favor law and a sense of honor. The tenets of the vampire paladins' oath reflect that view.
> 
> **Honesty.** Don't demean yourself with lying and cheating. Don't make promises you can't keep.
> 
> **Courage.** Never let a foe see your fear.
> 
> **Honor.** Treat your peers with fairness and your lessers with exactly what they deserve. Those who recognize your position deserve at least a modicum of respect.
> 
> **Duty.** Your actions should serve the aims of the queen and the church, and not bring dishonor to either. Take responsibility for your actions and their consequences, and obey your superiors.

## Brazen Coalition

The Brazen Coalition was formed by sailors who fled across the sea, escaping the final advance of the Legion of Dusk against the Free Cities of Torrezon. These mariners originally sought to establish colonies on Ixalan and trade with the cities of the Sun Empire. But when the Sun Empire drove them off, they turned instead to piracy and plunder. The Brazen Coalition has since become a loosely affiliated group of pirate captains who seek to rule the seas and claim the riches of Ixalan—especially the Immortal Sun.

- **Races.** [Goblin (Ixalan)](Mechanics/races/goblin-ixalan-psx.md), [Human (Ixalan)](Mechanics/races/human-ixalan-psx.md), [Orc (Ixalan)](Mechanics/races/orc-ixalan-psx.md), [Siren](Mechanics/races/siren-psx.md)  
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Charlatan](Mechanics/backgrounds/charlatan.md), [criminal](Mechanics/backgrounds/criminal.md), [entertainer](Mechanics/backgrounds/entertainer.md), [folk hero](Mechanics/backgrounds/folk-hero.md), [sage](Mechanics/backgrounds/sage.md), [sailor](Mechanics/backgrounds/sailor.md)  

### Suggested Classes

Consider the following class options for your Brazen Coalition character.

#### Bard

[Sirens](Mechanics/races/siren-psx.md) are frequently bards, and other pirates (especially in Captain Parrish's Deadeye fleet) collect knowledge as members of the [College of Lore](Mechanics/classes/bard-college-of-lore.md).

#### Fighter

A great many pirates are fighters, including not just [Champions](Mechanics/classes/fighter-champion.md) and [Battlemasters](Mechanics/classes/fighter-battle-master.md), but also [Eldritch Knights](Mechanics/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md) who combine martial skill with the magical talents common in the Coalition.

#### Rogue

Scoundrels, [swashbucklers](Mechanics/classes/rogue-swashbuckler-xge.md), [thieves](Mechanics/classes/rogue-thief.md), and killers make up the majority of the Brazen Coalition.

#### Warlock

Of all the peoples of Ixalan, the pirates of the Dire Fleet are most likely to traffic with demons. Many of its sailors become warlocks as a result of striking bargains with the [Fiend](Mechanics/classes/warlock-the-fiend.md).

#### Wizard

[Orc](Mechanics/races/orc-ixalan-psx.md) wizards use [fire](Mechanics/classes/wizard-school-of-evocation.md) and [necromantic](Mechanics/classes/wizard-school-of-necromancy.md) magic, [sirens](Mechanics/races/siren-psx.md) are fond of [enchantments](Mechanics/classes/wizard-school-of-enchantment.md), and [humans](Mechanics/races/human-ixalan-psx.md) employ a variety of magical talents, including the invention of magic items.
