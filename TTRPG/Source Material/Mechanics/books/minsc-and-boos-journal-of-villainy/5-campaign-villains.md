# Campaign Villains
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy, p. 91* 

There are six campaign villains in this chapter. If you aren't using one of them as your campaign villain, you might want to use them as a potential ally for your player characters, albeit one that isn't to be trusted. They also make powerful boss monsters for any high-level campaign.
