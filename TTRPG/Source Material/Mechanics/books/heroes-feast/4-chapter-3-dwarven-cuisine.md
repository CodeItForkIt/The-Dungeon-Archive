Dwarves boast a surprisingly eclectic and adaptable palate for a traditionally subterranean folk, but there is one dietary constant regardless of location or culture: meat. Grains and vegetables complement hearty and practical family-style meals, usually featuring core proteins ranging from sheep and beef to pork and pheasant, with the occasional reptile, fungus, or oversize insect finding their way into the main courses of deeper-dwelling dwarves.

## Hardy and Hearty

Standing roughly four feet tall with another foot of pride on top, dwarves were once primarily subterranean but have now increasingly populated surface coasts and plains, making cultural inroads into the villages and even cities of human-dominated worlds. An intensely private culture, these stout humanoids are hardworking and dedicated craftsmen—be it in mining, blacksmithing, weaponsmithing, stonework, or combat—and their prowess in the culinary arts is no exception. Dwarves are a stubborn, yet begrudgingly pliant breed, which has allowed their unique rituals, customs, and cuisine to endure regardless of the environment.

While dwarven dishes can sometimes taste one-note and homogenous to the uninitiated, their meals are surprisingly subtle to dwarven taste buds and can be a thoroughly well-rounded source of sustenance for various humanoids. However, few non-dwarves have ever tasted "true" dwarven cuisine, since most dwarven clans closely guard their secrets of the forge and the kitchen alike. Meanwhile, surface-dwelling dwarves are often savvy and resourceful, opting to incorporate locally sourced components—be it indigenous grains or the most readily available root vegetables—into their dishes in lieu of traditional ingredients. Nevertheless, their style of food remains constant, with savory and salty stews, marinated carved beasts, earthy root vegetables, and sauce-laden starches, all served in robust portions, dominating dwarven dinner tables alongside thick loaves of warm, dark bread for dipping and noshing. As for ales and mead, it's simply not a dwarven meal without them.

## Salty and Sour

Dwarves are a stubborn lot...and so are their palates. Nevertheless, they begrudgingly see the sense in accommodating a range of tastes, especially when traveling away from their mountain homes in the company of a multicultural band of adventurers. But in their native environments, dwarves of the mountains, and especially the hills (occasionally referred to as shield and gold dwarves, respectively), live in self-sustaining, clan-based societies that harvest and store great quantities of grain and dry-aged meats, planning carefully for the unforeseen. There is little room for waste or the superfluous in their culture or appetite. Regardless of what world they occupy, be it Krynn, Toril, Oerth, Eberron, or elsewhere, dwarves of the multiverse tend to exemplify constant attributes and even more steadfast tastes.

To that end, dwarven menus have evolved very little over the past millennia. Despite their well-documented obsession with all that shines, heritage is the one thing a dwarf values above any sum of mithral or precious gems and they do so with an almost hubristic commitment. Holidays and traditions such as Midwinter and Feast of the Moon remain dear to modern dwarves, and with them the requisite ceremonial dishes. Traveling dwarves are open to other types of food, (and they will never say no to a homemade meal), but they will proudly let you know how a dwarven touch, inevitably a savory one, might have improved it. More often than not, this just means taking a recipe and doubling the meat.

Pragmatic to the core, dwarves enjoy food and appreciate the ritual of a shared meal, but they do not belabor over its importance or the small talk that goes with it, preferring to eat and get on with it. They love to feast, but reserve communal dining for celebrations; the everyday meal of a dwarf is consumed hastily while on the job. Wholesome, often one-course meals provide essential nourishment and brief repose for these unflinchingly hardworking beings, and such meals are packed and eaten with little ceremony. When dwarves do eat together, storytelling and seemingly never-ending songs often intersect with mealtime, providing a vital chance for elders to dispense lessons and learnings when a clan is gathered beside a great hearth at the same table. It is on such occasions that the fruits of dwarven mining and craftsmanship are on display in their elaborate engraved flatware made from the most precious metals, and the enormous clanking steins bristling with gems.

Dwarves of the Underdark, commonly known as gray dwarves or duergar, have developed a fungi-based diet, since livestock and most vegetables are scantly available, let alone sustainable, below the surface. Duergar forage accordingly and have developed a nuanced tongue for fungal variances, and cleverly season the "meat" to stimulate, rather than modify, its natural flavors, favoring acidic, spicy, and briny flavors to salty or savory, based on the local availability of ingredients. They have a penchant for nurturing great fields of diverse mycological vegetation, complemented with tubers or roots.

The other primary difference between surface-dwelling dwarves and duergar is the level of alcohol consumption. Hill and mountain dwarves have a legendary appetite for beer and ale, one so profound that it might be said that the food that accompanies them is an afterthought. Duergar appreciate the occasional drink but are not a celebratory lot. They imbibe in solemnity and considerable moderation. While duergar maintain their cousins' utilitarian ideals of harvesting and stockpiling basic available edibles, their distant kin, gully dwarves, have taken orthodox dwarven pragmatism to the next extreme, foregoing harvesting all together and scavenging without qualm.

## Secret Spices

A dwarven cupboard is often simple, well-organized, and deeply stocked. It's uncommon to see rare spices in the kitchen, with flavor additives erring on the tried and true. A common misconception about dwarves is that they lack adventurous culinary spirit or imagination, but in fact they have highly sensitive taste buds, often overwhelmed by bright, piquant, or saccharine flavors. They prefer their soups dense, their sauces thick, their meats long-aged or marinated over days, their vegetables roasted or sautéed (rarely raw), with salads and pescatarian options uncommon (save for duergar), though dried fruits and salted legumes might find their way into trail mix or iron rations. Although dwarves crave and utilize an immensely broad base of staples, key culinary decisions are often made by first choosing a stout and then selecting a main course to pair with it. And the dwarves' knack for a good liquor-meat pairing is usually on point, with their choice of drink serving to activate new flavors in the dish or, at minimum, enhance the inherent.

## Bangers and Smash

Nothing makes a dwarf stand quite so tall in the morning as a breakfast platter steaming with sausages and smashed baby potatoes. These traditional sausages are sheet pan-baked with succulent tomatoes that soak up the juices and practically polymorph into a meat themselves. Dwarven smiths are known to keep their bangers and smash warm all morning in an iron skillet that rests atop their furnace, so they can plunge a fork into it and satisfy their appetites without straying too far from their duties.

## Delzoun "Tide-Me-Overs"

Beef, pork, onions, and a smattering of dwarven seasoning are all rolled up into delicious little balls that are ideal for snacking or as a main banquet course. These "meatballs," as they are known to many in the multiverse, are sometimes served with a side of freshly crushed tart berries for dwarves on the go, but they are best when drenched in a sweet, dark dwarven gravy made with chicken broth and enlivened with brown sugar, lemon, and soy sauce. While these are customary consumables at Hornmoot, the traditional human-dwarven trading festival that marks the dawn of Spring, there isn't a holiday on the eventful dwarven calendar that doesn't feature these scrumptious meats on the menu.

## Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread

Sometimes called "fungus two ways," this zesty duergar essential is sure to rouse the taste buds of even the most spice-crazed tiefling. Made from the bright-white roots of Underdark lotus or bluecap fungus, these tubers are steamed and then cut thin into crunchy, round slices, perfect for dipping. However, if you can't source authentic Underdark produce, sliced radishes have a similar texture and flavor, and even jicama, cucumbers, or romaine lettuce can work in a pinch. The star of the show, however, is the spread, made from the pale-orange fire lichen fungus that is ground into a delectable spicy paste. But make sure to keep a waterorb handy—this stuff is hot!

## Miner's Pie

The Miner's Pie, sometimes referred to as a "shepherd's pie" by humans and halflings, is a truly hearty one-stop meal for the tireless dwarf in all of us. Ground beef (or lamb or venison), sweet corn, peas, onions, and leeks are crusted by a potato mash topped with cheese. This is one of the few dwarven dishes readily served at inns across Faerûn, particularly those of the North and Heartlands, likely because the human variant borrows much from this dwarven classic.

## Potato Leek Soup

A Mithral Hall mainstay of Faerûn, dwarven potato leek soup is a stalwart starter that is prepared as thick as mortals can stand it. Served year-round, this dense and nutritious vegetable blend is perfect for warming the limbs and souls of dwarves subjected to the unrelenting cold of damp subterranean life. Sloppily ladled into oversize ramekins and prepared voluminously in full anticipation of seconds (and thirds), it's made to satiate the bottomless hunger of weary warriors or tireless miners. You can't go wrong with toppings such as chopped scallions, chives, and bacon!

## Smoked Sausages and Kraut with Dwarven Mustard

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/dwarven_logo_hf.webp#center)

At the end of a long day working in fiery forges and lava-filled mines, most dwarves have an insatiable craving for salty and sour foods, always paired with a strong ale. Nothing hits the spot quite like a heaping plate of dwarven smoked sausages with mounds of briny sauerkraut—a recipe, according to legend, forged and handed down by the Dwarffather god Moradin himself! When possible, serve these plump sausages with dwarven mustard, a lightly spiced, sweet, stone-ground condiment. In some regions of Cormyr, this mustard is widely regarded as a cure-all.

## Corned Beef and Cabbage

From the mines of the Ironroot Mountains to the halls of the Iron Hills, this savory winter repast is a favorite of dwarves everywhere. Hungry miners will blush pinker than the beef itself when their noses catch the distinct scent of coriander, allspice, peppercorns, bay leaves, thyme, and red pepper flakes wafting from a full-to-the-brim cauldron. Served in a light, tangy broth with generous helpings of boiled cabbage and doused in vinegar, this dish is sure to satisfy the salt cravings of even the saltiest dwarves (just as long as you don't forget the ale).

## Gully Dwarf Homestyle Porridge

If you've ever attended a gully dwarf meal, you've probably only done so once. As scavengers who dwell in the deepest, darkest, and dirtiest parts of subterranean spaces, their dining habits are not exactly refined. But a wholesale dismissal of their cuisine would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater (which gully dwarves are known to drink on occasion). Traditional gully dwarf porridge calls for a grainy stew chock-full of...you don't want to know. However, their more civilized dwarven cousins have developed their own morningfeast dish, which cleverly pokes fun at the inedible original. Their version, also called "dirty porridge," comprises of a creamy oatmeal-style base chock-full of dates, chopped nuts, dark sugars, and a dose of cream. Dwarves have even been known to brew a savory "gully dwarf porridge" containing leftover sausage bits, streaks of bacon fat, and finely chopped scallions in a grits-style "broth." Regardless of which version you eat, this porridge from the world of Krynn is a true random encounter for your taste buds.

## Dwarven Flatbread

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/dwarven_logo_hf.webp#center)

Generations of dwarven smiths have relied on this toothsome snack bread to get them through long, arduous workdays, and to their next meal. According to folklore, these tasty flat loaves weren't created in the kitchen, but rather at the forge as ever-industrious, hungry dwarven craftsman utilized the only materials they had available: flour, oil, water, salt, a hearth, and a hammer. The result? Flat bread. Sometimes served pan-griddled, other times fried, this bread can be eaten plain, topped with cheese or HF, or used to soak up all of those savory juices and sauces from what dwarven diners showed up for in the first place—meat!

## Orange Mountain Duck

Dwarves are widely renowned for their "unsweet tooth," but that doesn't deny them good taste, as evidenced by the southern Faerûnian gold dwarves' affinity for orange and persimmon mountain duck. The uniquely hot-and-tart sauce brightens the succulent gamey meat and yields a divine duck-skin treat. Perhaps years of living near humans wore them down or broadened their palate, but it is said modern dwarves have actually come to blows over the coveted crispy skin alone! While this dish might not grace the subterranean banquet halls of days long gone, it is surely on the surface dwarf menus of today.

## Plate-of-Gold

Dwarves aren't known for eating their vegetables, but when the vegetables are drenched in a salty, golden batter and oil-fried until crisp, they can't get enough of them! Don't forget to finish these fried delights with a dousing of "golden sauce"—a syrupy, sweet confection laced with a citrus accent. This dish is particularly popular among surface dwarves who have greater access to fresh produce and root vegetables.

## Black Pudding

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/dwarven_logo_hf.webp#center)

No, not that black pudding! Eating real monsters is precarious play. Sure, some are considered delicacies and host to exquisite flavors of unimaginable complexity, but most are full of toxins and poisons that simply aren't worth the risk, to say nothing of what it takes to actually capture and kill your dinner. Inspired by one of those nasty dungeon-dwelling beasties and based on a goblin dish called "elf pudding" (you don't want to know), this traditional coffee and chocolate mousse is sure to satisfy even the most discerning dwarven palate. This dense caffeinated dessert is known to keep dwarves working their forges until the wee hours. Eat it before it eats you!
