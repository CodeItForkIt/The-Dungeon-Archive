# Introduction
*Source: Heroes' Feast, p. xii* 

What is Dungeons & Dragons? For some, it's a dynamic narrative game with infinite possibilities; for others, an exciting tactical contest of strategy and wit. But for many, it is far more than a game; it's a way of life.

If you're holding this book, then you probably love two things: D&D and sharing a great meal. And why shouldn't you? Few things go together so well: they're tabletop activities and highly social occasions, and both offer endless possibilities. But the similarities run far deeper. No matter where you are in the world, food is at the center of community and connection. For millions of fans, D&D plays very much the same role. You might say that D&D is the food of the imagination.

Dungeons & Dragons is no ordinary game, and this is no ordinary cookbook; it's a uniquely D&D cookbook. Inside, you'll find familiar recipes and dishes that were only available to your D&D player characters, until now—an adventure of food! We began this quest with a simple inquiry: how can food elevate and enhance the D&D experience? If the magic of D&D springs from its ability to activate the human imagination, then how can we recast that same enchantment over an inspiring set of recipes? In short, we want this book to be an essential part of your game nights. Why put out a bag of chips when you can prepare a batch of Halfling Oatmeal Sweet Nibbles? Or perhaps you're craving the same Iron Rations as your dungeon-delving character to sustain you through the game. Which protein will flavor your Sword Coast Seafood Bouillabaisse? Maybe you should roll for it. If you are new to the kitchen, try a lower-level recipe to start! Our goal is to stimulate the spirit of adventure at your gaming table and beyond by inviting you to enter a new culinary dimension.

Here you will find a curated selection of D&D recipes spanning the vast multiverse. They are all delicious, easy to prepare, and composed of ingredients readily found in this realm. Even better, these recipes offer a unique opportunity to enhance the social experience that is D&D, whether it happens to be a game night or you just wish it were. Because D&D is bound only by the limits of the imagination, without an agreed-upon singular storyline or locale, we have organized this cookbook by one of the game's few ubiquitous devices: the multitude of playable fantasy groups featured in D&D's 5th edition. This structure invites D&D and fantasy lovers alike to eat like their favorite fictional cultures—from elves and dwarves to orcs and drow—while we shed fresh light on their stories via their unique cuisines and lifestyles.

Dungeons & Dragons is about far more than monsters or treasure; it's built on the foundation of community, friendship, and imagination. This culinary compendium will inspire and encourage those same principles through the art and craft of cooking, while adding an exciting and visceral new layer to your game nights: sights, smells, touch, and, of course, *tastes*.

So, what is Dungeons & Dragons? Join us as we find our answer through the dishes and cuisine that make this multiverse so delicious.

## About This Book: Creating Food and Water

The culinary canvas of the D&D multiverse is no different than the game itself: it's bound only by the imagination. However, Dungeons & Dragons is also rich with real-world influences, drawing heavily from our own past as well as fictional realms created by some of the world's greatest dreamers. Roast meats, hearty grains, cooked vegetables, and other familiar staples dominate the in-world menus from the castles of Krynn to the taverns of the Forgotten Realms of Toril. And while the worlds of D&D have many similarities to our own, unless you have a kitchen full of magical items, knowledge of powerful spells, and access to an array of mystical ingredients, you won't be able to prepare many of its recipes in their original forms. And let's be honest, many foods referenced in D&D materials are not quite right for the modern Earth palate (crisped worm skewers, anyone?).

Fear not, brave adventurer! We've put together dishes that are not only true to their various worlds, but also tasty and possible to prepare here in ours. Can't find rothé meat at the local butcher? Don't worry—grass-fed beef or buffalo will do. Trying to find a substitute for cockatrice? Well, it's said that everything tastes like cockatrice, so chicken should suffice. Our methodology in creating this recipe collection was simple: find every notable dish, ingredient, and recipe in the D&D multiverse; curate and modify it for feasibility, appropriateness, and, most important, flavor; and present it here in a way that even a 1st level chef might be able to make it for game night. Accordingly, our master chef has not only provided easy-to-follow recipes but also some helpful "Cook's Notes" that will guide you through every aspect of the journey. "So enjoy, and may the dice be good to you!"

### Adventuring Equipment

Like a red dragon's lair, the road of culinary adventure is fraught with both peril and reward. Only with a fair amount of attention to detail, ingenuity, and luck do you have a chance of survival. But you'll also need the right equipment. Whether it be the sword for the fighter or the spellbook for the magic-user, all adventurers need the proper tools of the trade to ensure their success. Here are some implements that will help you complete this adventure and hopefully gain some experience along the way:

- Cheese grater  
- Cocktail shaker and muddler  
- Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pan  
- Food processor  
- Measuring cups and spoons  
- Pastry brush  
- Pie plate  
- Strainer  
- Stand mixer or electric hand-mixer  
- Tongs  
- Wire rack  

### A Digestible Cookbook

Distilling forty-five years of D&D culinary traditions, dishes, ingredients, and flavors is a formidable task and one that requires an appropriately comprehensive approach. To this end, we have endeavored to provide as many angles and perspectives as possible to guide you through this delicious journey. Here are a few thematic devices we used to unlock this multiverse of flavor:

#### Heroes' Feasts

Bad news. You've been teleported into Acererak's Chamber of Hopelessness. A magical inscription on the wall reads: "You who dared to violate my tomb now pay the price. Stay here and die slowly of starvation, or open and enter the door to the south, where certain but quick death awaits." Good news! You're locked in with an 11th level druid who can cast Heroes' Feast once per day, ensuring you certainly won't starve to death as the inscription had predicted. But...bad news again: your druid is particularly fond of liver and anchovies, and you can be sure the rest of your days will be spent eating nothing but gamy and briny morsels. The south door is looking better and better, or maybe you'll just starve to death after all.

All Heroes' Feasts are not the same. They are often left open to the tastes, preferences, and skills of the casters themselves, all of which can lead to significant variation. This is further compounded by the eclectic eating preferences of each fantasy culture. Would an elven cleric make the same Heroes' Feast as a half-orc druid? Not likely. While we can't account for all possible variations of this spell, we do know that it is a multicourse meal of "magnificent food and drink," which has significant restorative properties. To this end, we have defined what the Heroes' Feast might look like across the different fantasy folk, and when you see the below icons, it means that the recipe should be included in a proper Heroes' Feast for that culture.

#### Magnificent Menus

All establishments in the D&D multiverse, whether humble roadside taverns or lofty banquet halls, have a time, place, and purpose, but some have undeniably stood out above the rest. In this recurring feature, we want to provide an in-world glance at the fare of some of the most renowned establishments located throughout some of D&D's most storied locales. Look for the asterisks on each menu denoting which recipes are included in the book.

## Worlds of Flavor

While Dungeons & Dragons doesn't have a single, agreed-upon world or storyline, from a culinary standpoint there are a few locales that have stood out above the rest. The core campaign worlds that inspired the recipes from this book include:

### Forgotten Realms

Created by Ed Greenwood, the *Forgotten Realms* is a rich, high-fantasy setting full of colorful characters and diverse locales. Rooted on an Earth-like planet called Abeir-Toril (*Toril* for short), this sprawling campaign world hosts a wide variety of features, from dense medieval-style metropolises and ports, impenetrable castles and fortresses, and one-horse hamlets to thick forests, rolling meadows, craggy mountains, and vast deserts, all spread across several key continents, including Kara-Tur, Zakhara, Maztica, and, most famously, Faerûn (and the Underdark that exists below its surface). Faerûn boasts some of the game's most storied locations, including the areas and regions of the Sword Coast, the Savage Frontier, the Dalelands, Calimshan, Chult, Cormyr, Thay, Amn, and Icewind Dale, as well as the legendary cities of Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, Calimport, and the notorious Underdark city of Menzoberranzan. The cuisine of Toril is as varied as the settings themselves, from dishes inspired by traditional medieval Europe to tastes derived from the Middle East, Asia, as well as the Americas.

### Greyhawk

The brainchild of D&D co-creator Gary Gygax, *Greyhawk* is a gritty, sword-and-sorcery-style world full of deadly dungeons and forbidden, arcane magic. This campaign is set on another Earth-like planet with medieval sensibilities—a geocentric globe called Oerth. Similar to Earth, Oerth has several continents, including Hepmonaland, Hyperboria, and, most notably, Oerik, which hosts an area on its eastern part commonly referred to as the Flanaess. The Flanaess is home to Greyhawk's most famous regions and kingdoms, including Perrenland, the Shield Lands, Urnst, Luz, Veluna, Keoland, Sunndi, and Furyondy. Fabled cities and dungeons dot these areas from the Free City of Greyhawk, the Village of Hommlet, and White Plume Mountain to Saltmarsh, Blackmoor, and beyond. Greyhawk's cuisine is primarily inspired by dishes from feudal Europe, especially the tavern fare and game of medieval Britain and other areas throughout mainland Europe, sometimes with a fantastical, or even otherworldly twist.

### Eberron

A creation of Keith Baker, *Eberron* is a world of swashbuckling, pulpy adventure where elaborate mechanisms and powerful magic exist side by side. The planet Eberron comprises several continents, the most famous of which is Khorvaire. There, the eclectic five nations of Aundair, Breland, the Mournland (Cyre), Karrnath, and Thrane yearn for supremacy over the ruined Kingdom of Galifar. From the towers and sky ships of Sharn to the ruin-filled port city of Stormreach, this whimsical, post-war campaign has something for everyone, including its cuisine, which boasts extraordinary variety across the five nations. The flavors of Eberron range from simple medieval-style fare to highly refined and complex gastronomic concoctions made with Victorian sensibilities using a combination of magic and machines.

### Dragonlance

Developed by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, *Dragonlance* is a dreamy, high-fantasy world of purple mountains, evergreen trails, crystal lakes, and dragons of every color. Dragonlance's campaign world of Krynn is one of opposing polarities where magic is rare and natural-born enemies are tasked with working together to maintain cosmic balance and avoid total destruction. Ansalon is the most well-known of the planet's five continents, and it includes many of the famous locations from the campaign's bestselling novels, including Solace, Qué-Shu, Pax Tharkas, Tarsis, Xak Tsaroth, Istar, Qualinost, Silvanost, Solamnia, and beyond. The fare of this lush world ranges from traditional medieval tavern and peasant food to distinctive flavors from the Middle East and Asia.

### Other Worlds

In addition to the previously mentioned realms, there are myriad other worlds in the Dungeons & Dragons pantheon, which are nearly as numerous as the players themselves. From the scorched plains of Athas in Dark Sun to the cruel mists of Barovia in gothic Ravenloft, all are united by the mystical gateways of Planescape. There truly is no limit to D&D or the worlds in which it lives.

### Legendary Establishments

You can't go far in any D&D campaign without spending some time at a tavern, bar, inn, or eatery. These dicey locales are frequently where critical information is gathered and often where the adventure begins (or ends if you wind up getting into a deadly scuffle). Some establishments have seen more than their fair share of adventure, and the following are among D&D's most iconic.

#### The Yawning Portal

This iconic tavern and eatery located in the City of Waterdeep is among the most famous in the Forgotten Realms. Owned and operated by a gruff former adventurer called Durnan the Wanderer, this multilevel establishment tenders not only fine food and drink, but potential fame and fortune as well. Built atop one of D&D's largest and most notorious dungeons, the fabled Undermountain, this tavern offers paying customers entrance to the sprawling lair via a well that leads into its depths. Unfortunately, most patrons never return. For the menu, see "this page".

#### The Inn of the Last Home

Seated in the branches of a massive vallenwood tree, this rustic, country tavern located in the town of Solace is without a doubt the most famous establishment in the Dragonlance world. It is here where the Heroes of the Lance assemble and begin their unexpected journey among the wafting smells of HF—a specialty of the proprietor, Otik Sandath, and often prepared by its lovely barmaid, Tika Waylan, who becomes one of the unlikely adventurers herself. Known for its strong ales, tasty food, and cozy atmosphere, the Inn of the Last Home is a can't-miss stop for those who traverse the world of Krynn. For the menu, see "this page".

#### Celestial Vista Restaurant

Floating high above Eberron's City of Sharn in the Azure District of Skyway is the city's renowned Celestial Vista Restaurant. Here, well-to-do tourists and locals alike flock for the view and the cosmopolitan cuisine—where gastronomic innovation meets the traditional dishes of the five nations. Owned by powerful city council member Evix ir'Marasha, the atmosphere is elegant, the food is purified (by House Ghallanda), and the prices are as high as the eatery itself. For the menu, see "this page".

#### The Green Dragon Inn

Situated in the River Quarter of the Free City of Greyhawk, this iconic pub is everything you'd expect of a D&D tavern: dark, cozy, and dangerous. Hushed conversations linger over map-covered tables, while the smell of roasted game wafts heavily above the underlying stench of stale ale. Whether you're looking for tasty regional cuisine of the Flanaess or trouble, you'll find it at the Green Dragon. For the menu, see "this page".

## Tips for Magical Cooking

Excerpt from the *Codex of Eldritch Cuisine*

The Great Library of Candlekeep, built upon the rocky cliffs of the Sword Coast, is home to the most famous and comprehensive collection of arcane texts in all of Toril. But few know that cloistered behind the library's fortressed walls resides the greatest repository of culinary knowledge as well. The exhaustive archive boasts thousands of gastronomic tomes from the greater multiverse, many scribed ages ago by long-forgotten chefs whose creations await rediscovery. The following tips were discovered in the *Codex of Eldritch Cuisine*.

### Use Magic

For denizens of the multiverse, it is preferable (and much safer) to cast [mage hand](Mechanics/spells/mage-hand.md), and have your spectral appendage cut the vegetables for you. Of course, if you have a druid or cleric in your midst, they can simply cast [heroes' feast](Mechanics/spells/heroes-feast.md) and skip all of the fuss! If you are not so arcanely inclined, please take your time. Speed won't win you any awards in the kitchen, and severed digits will rarely improve upon any of the recipes. However, the lizardfolk recipe for Fried Fingers is an exception to this rule.

### Keep Thy Blades Sharp

Chopping carrots is just like severing heads, and a dull blade simply won't get the job done. Ask any respectable half-orc chef and they will impress upon you to take the same care with a fine butcher knife as you do with a great axe.

### Clean as You Cook

Staring down a sink full of sullied pots, pans, and dishes can be just as daunting as squaring off against an ancient black dragon. It's advisable to handle the cleaning duties during your downtime so that you can enjoy the meal carefree when it's ready. Unless, of course, you can cast [prestidigitation](Mechanics/spells/prestidigitation.md) to clean those dishes, then do whatever in the nine hells you please.

### Plan Ahead

Manage your time and your menu to ensure the meal is ready when desired. It's advisable to read through whichever recipe before you set out to make it, to avoid surprises or missing ingredients.

### Cook with Friends

If you are unable to conjure your [unseen servant](Mechanics/spells/unseen-servant.md) for sous-chef duties, then form an adventuring party for your culinary conquests. It's fun to cook with a friend or two, and okay to taste as you go.

### Procure the Right Equipment

The tools of the trade must be respected. You will save much time, effort, and aggravation if you can find any of these hanging around your kitchen:

Pan of Cooking; Pan of Spicing; Spoon of Eating; Spoon of Mixing; Spoon of Sugar; Tablecloth of Feasting; Chalice of Liquid Food; Book of Dinner; Apron of Comfort; Planar Fork ; Fork of Travel; Mug of Warming; Mystical Brown Coating Box; Platter of Purity; the Eternal Salt Shaker; Utensil of the Cultured Palate; Utensil of Etiquette.
