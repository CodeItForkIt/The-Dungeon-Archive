> The elven feast was held in the courtyard just south of the great golden tower. There were no walls about the platform of crystal and marble which sat atop the highest hill in Qualinost, offering an unobstructed view of the glittering city below, the dark forest beyond, and even the deep purple edge of the Tharkadan Mountains far to the south....Caramon decided he knew why elves were so slender: the food consisted of fruits and vegetables, cooked in delicate sauces, served with bread and cheeses and a very light, spicy wine.

Elves have a complicated relationship with their food. As timeless, magical, and ethereal beings who can live for more than 700 years, elves view food as one of the few elements that connects them to mortality. Yet, they love and are ineffably drawn to all good things of the world: nature, magic, art, music, and, of course, food. But not all nourishment is created equal, and elves are especially particular when it comes to what they will put in their bodies. Often seen by outsiders as "picky eaters," their beliefs and life philosophy affect their eating habits every bit as much, if not more so, than their cravings and taste buds.

## Wholesome And Refined

You've probably never seen an elf eat and you probably never will. To be sure, elves will join or even host a supper and the meal in front of them will find a way to disappear over time, but it is rare to ever see an elf actually put a tasty morsel in their mouth. Elves are an intensely private people, and this carries over to every part of their dining. With elves, presentation and etiquette are paramount, and their food is every bit as elegant and graceful as its preparers and consumers. Hand-carved tables adorned with bowls made of marble, gold, and silver set the stage for a visual (and literal) feast of fruits, vegetables, breads, cheeses, and occasional meats—a dream-like display where every imaginable color is represented. Elves pay close attention to what they consume and will not mute the taste with idle banter at the table, apart from giving thanks to their host and the living things that made the meal possible.

## Timeless Tastes

Perhaps more than any other culture, the tastes, preferences, and palate of the elves are aligned with their lifestyle and firmly rooted in their beliefs. They are a lithe people and the foods they favor are fittingly light, fresh, and wholesome. They generally avoid preservatives and prefer fiber to fat; citrus to salt; and sweet to spicy. Even their iron rations, known as quith-pa, are made up entirely of dried fruits. Because they place such a strong value on life, a high percentage of elves stringently exercise food restrictions, and a great many would fall into the category of vegetarian, vegan, or pescatarian—little that bleeds end up on elven plates. Even with these frequent restrictions, elven culinary mastery is renowned, and many humans who aspire to be gourmet chefs seek apprenticeship among elves.

It is said that all elven subcultures are offshoots of the nomadic high elves who searched the worlds far and wide, choosing to settle in the lands that struck their fancy. Yet, elves are among the most diverse within the multiverse, with cultural variations playing a huge part of that diversity. High elves, such as Eladrin, Qualinesti, and Silvanesti, are the most refined, and insist on the finest-quality ingredients and visual perfection in their feasts. Because these communities are typically insulated and prosperous, they can afford to be choosier in their diets, even introducing complex yet wholesome sauces and garnishes to their dishes. High elves tend to align their diets most closely to their values, and prefer fruits, vegetables, and grains to meat and poultry. By contrast, wood elves are often wanderers and adventurers and, consequently, more disposed to hunting and foraging. These elves necessarily exhibit more flexibility in their diets, ranging from nuts and berries to wild game such as venison, turkey, and rabbit, and fish including salmon and trout. Wood elves also favor consuming whole foods, and relish individual ingredients from the land rather than blending different flavors.

While most differences between elves are somewhat superficial, relegated to simple variations in dress, dwellings, culture, or beliefs, there are two notable exceptions that could almost be categorized as separate groups entirely: half-elves and drow.

While half-elves are technically uncommon, their palate is effectively a blend of elven and human sensibilities. The environment in which half-elves are raised and reside ultimately determines where they fall on the culinary scale, but they typically build their diets with an elven base and venture into human accents and preparation techniques.

Surface-dwelling elves and drow of the Underdark are as different as day and night, especially when it comes to their palates. However, one thing they share in common is a penchant for locally sourced, fresh (sometimes alive, in the case of the drow) ingredients. But unlike the forests of their cousins, the drow's Underdark is a veritable cornucopia of briny, sour, earthy, bitter, and tangy ingredients, from roots and worms to lurkers and fungi. Due to a low supply of salt in the Underdark, vinegars and acids flavor many dishes of the drow, who have as much affinity for meat and fish as they do produce, which for them consists mostly of fungi and tubers.

## Culinary Exploration and Adventure

Like most cultures of the multiverse, elves prefer to use ingredients sourced from their immediate environment. Elves are primarily gatherers and farmers; although, thanks to their ready access to magic, they cultivate food for subsistence without having to clear or plow lands. Some secret ingredients used in the highest elven cuisine are themselves transmuted through sorcery from mundane plant products and spices such as paprika. The elves that hunt do so thoughtfully, careful not to disrupt the delicate balance of nature.

With regards to beverages, elves largely subsist on sparkling waters from mountain springs, but are known to enjoy spirits and wines, preferring feywine to all other concoctions. This ancient nectar—crafted from flower juice and honey, and imbued with a secret ingredient (one that remains a mystery to humans, dwarves, and even most elves)—is the drink of choice at the majority of elven festivals, providing euphoric effects that can last for days or even weeks. Adventurers be warned—the effects of this drink are powerful and disorienting, often causing members of other groups who imbibe to lose all sense of self for months, which is why elves rarely, if ever, part with it.

## Quith-pa

While it may not sate a halfling-size appetite, quith-pa has sustained the bodies of elven adventurers for generations. The most common variety of elven iron rations, this vegetarian trail food is made up primarily of dried fruits, but regional variations can include seeds, nuts, legumes, and beyond. Designed to be as light in the pack as it is in the body, this basic nourishment ensures travelers won't suffer a post-meal slog on the trail. Meanwhile, its wholesome ingredients and simple, clean flavors are perfect for even the most finicky elven palate.

## Feywild Eggs

There is a parallel plane to the "Prime" (the one that contains all known worlds of the multiverse) known as the Feywild, or the Plane of Faerie, from which sylvan creatures such as pixies, satyrs, unicorns, dryads, and the like originated. It was in this mirror realm, bathed in eternal twilight and ethereal luminescence, that all elven-kind was birthed from swirling, limitless magic, including the eladrin—elves with an unfathomably deep connection to the seasons. These elves, who still call the fey dimension home, boast a highly intuitive link with nature and are able to craft incredible meals with near-perfect combinations of ingredients. One dish, known as Feywild eggs, is a delightful presentation of creamed, herbed, and fluffed eggs, completed over even heat for a golden crisp finish. Some have claimed this simple recipe descended from the leShay, an immortal breed of fey "elves" with incredible, godlike powers. Thankfully, you don't need to visit the Feywild to try these eggs. An elf of good repute has vouched that this concoction is fairly authentic eladrin eating.

## High Harvest Puree

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/elven_logo_hf.webp#center)

Highharvestide is a regional celebration of harvest and plenty that occurs annually near the autumnal equinox in certain regions of Toril. In days past, tradition mandated that elves solely consume nature's dew in honor of giving thanks; however, in recent years, the holiday has evolved into a multicourse feast anchored by a cornucopia of autumnal-themed dishes, including a warm and comforting blend of crop plants. This nourishing puree, a favorite of wood elves and eladrin alike, is a mélange of butternut squash, garlic, and thyme that is slow-simmered for a sweet and earthy flavor and garnished with an olive oil accent.

## Elven Bread

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/064_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Elven bakers have protected the secret of this bread for millennia. Both nutritious and delicious, a single bite of this mysterious rolled pastry loaf can sustain an adventurer for a day or more of journeying. Sweet and robust in flavor and made of fine grains and rich butter, elven bread is rumored to boast twice the nutritional value of iron rations at only half the weight, making it essential adventuring fare for elves on the go. Even the most discerning high elves can't resist this wholesome, cinnamon—and sometimes cardamom—swirled treat.

## Wood Elf Forest Salad

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/elven_logo_hf.webp#center)

This colorful, flower-infused wild-leaf medley with vibrant citrus accents is a quintessential salad of the Kagonesti elves of Krynn. These ancient elves harbor a deep reverence for nature and a refined, almost instinctual, tongue when it comes to culinary combinations. Sometimes called "chopforest" among the wood elves of Toril and Oerth, this bountiful, verdant mix is brimming with sharp accents and crisp textures that almost magically share the palate with the subtler foraged flavors at play. It's as much a visual trip through Ansalon's western woods, from the forest floor all the way to the highest-reaching branches, as it is an edible one.

## Elven Marruth

These two-bite, turnover-style pastries, stuffed with a variety of minced regional vegetables, are perfect for snacking trailside or at the banquet table. Sometimes reductively referred to as "root pies" by dwarves and humans, marruth are incredibly hearty closed-face canapés that are filled with spiced and herbed mashes of vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, and carrots) and then lightly baked in a flaky, buttery crust. They are traditionally served warm, occasionally as a meal in itself, with a chilled flute of elverquist to wash them down. Once cooled, these pastries can be rolled into rallow leaves (thick and oily waterproof broadleaves) to preserve them for travel.

## Drow Mushroom Steaks

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/067_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

A delicacy of the great Underdark City of Spiders, Menzoberranzan, these seasoned ripplebark mushroom steaks are harvested fresh from the fungi fields near Lake Donigarten. While their exact agronomy is a closely guarded drow secret, many speculate that fertilizer from the Donigarten island [rothé](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rothe-vgm.md) make these mushrooms grow unusually large, meaty, and nutrient rich. They're so tasty and chewy, you'll think you are eating unicorn! This dish has become so popular that it has migrated to the surface, and it's even rumored to be a favorite of [Xanathar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xanathar-wdh.md) of Waterdeep, a notorious beholder who prefers it to surface-grown mushrooms as well as raw meat. But make sure to carefully read the label on that bottle of balsamic vinegar—the drow are as famous for their poisons as their sauces.

## Cherrybread

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/068_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

In some worlds of the multiverse, this dense dessert bread is also named "fruitcake." Regardless of title or origin, cherrybread boasts various diced bits including dried fruits (cherries, dates, citron, currants, raisins, and sometimes more) marinated in spirits and nuts (walnuts and hazelnuts), all held together by just enough vanilla batter (with a splash of molasses) to do the job. It is sold in bake shoppes the Realms over as small loaf cakes or as leaf-wrapped slices suitable for travel. While this treat surges in popularity during the holidays, cherrybread makes a wonderful addition to teatimes on or off the trail all year long.

## Greenspear Bundles in Bacon

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/069_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Greenspear, also referred to as asparagus or "sparrow grass" by humans, is a perennial flower plant that has ascended to staple-status in many elven diets. While elves consume greenspear raw, seasoned, roasted, or steamed with herbs, their half-elf brethren—liberated from certain culinary taboos—have developed an additional preparation technique. In an irreverent touch, but one that flavorfully complements the greenspear, half-elves add salted and cured pork into the mix, in deference to their half-human taste buds. Regarding bacon, the thicker cut is always the better!

## Moonshae Seafood Rice

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/070_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

Originated in the mythical elven isle of Evermeet but popularized by adventurous expatriates along the Sword Coast and its scattered archipelago, this creamy fish rice dish requires a patient chef...but it's well worth the wait! Short-grain rice (which yields a stickier, compact texture), along with a medley of ocean "fruits," including shrimp and scallops, is slow cooked in a rich seafood broth until it reaches a smooth, velvety consistency. Butter, onion, saffron, elven dry white wine, and olive oil all intermingle and do their part in activating the dreamy maritime flavors. Some elven chefs of old would finish the dish with a swirl of mascarpone.

## Dragon Salmon

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/elven_logo_hf.webp#center)

Aundair is the breadbasket of Eberron's Khorvaire, and the Aundair River is famous for the seafood that half-elven anglers bring back to the markets of Fairhaven. Their traditional preparation of the enormous salmon that spawn in that river, like much else in Aundair, relies heavily on sauces: in this case a butter and dark wine reduction. The aristocracy would sample only a tiny fillet before moving on to further courses, but in simpler households, a single dragon salmon could feed a family. After their fish, the locals would turn to a cremfel, a thin pancake stuffed with rich cream and slices of fresh fruit.

## Qualinesti Vegetable Stew

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/recipes/HF/072_Newm_9781984858900_lay_art_r1.webp#center)

In the world of Krynn, shortly after the ancient Kinslayer Wars, Prince Kith-Kanan appealed to his brother King Sithas for western sovereignty. His brother peacefully granted the western elves independence from the nation of Silvanesti. However, Kith-Kanan, the new king of the western elves, was met with decades of hardships resulting from the diaspora. Until their capital Qualinost was founded, his elven people struggled to find new ways of living off the land. Several simple and humble meals entered the repertoire of the elven diet, including "Harvest Prize," an artfully prepared baked vegetable casserole. Sourceable produce such as eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomato were thinly sliced then stacked in fanned layers upon fresh basil and tomato (crushed into a sauce), then drizzled with fresh and fragrant oils before roasting. This humble yet abundant dish could feed an entire elven village at little cost. Although the elves of Krynn now prepare variations of this dish year-round with inspired substitutions to harness the seasons, the combination below is the most classic and recommended.

## Meal's End

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/book/HF/elven_logo_hf.webp#center)

Heavy cream, foraged fruits, and a crushed dark meringue comprise a delightful combination of flavors that offer a light and colorful post-meal elven sweet. Elves aren't decadent and are resultantly not known for their culinary prowess with desserts, but this refreshing dish is quick to concoct and easy to serve by the bowlful, requiring no baking. While there are subtle variations of "meal's end" based on region and culture, the version with chopped persimmon or plum in lieu of field berries is quite sensational and thus recommended.
