# Chapter 1: Character Options
*Source: Sigil and the Outlands, p. 7* 

When you create a character for adventures set in Sigil or the Outlands, you can choose from any options the D&D game provides, including those described in this chapter. As always, check with your DM before creating a character to make sure the options you prefer are available.

## Backgrounds

This section presents two backgrounds for 1st-level characters with strong ties to Sigil, the Outlands, or both: the [Gate Warden](Mechanics/backgrounds/gate-warden-sato.md) and the [Planar Philosopher](Mechanics/backgrounds/planar-philosopher-sato.md).

If you select either of these backgrounds, you gain the feat specified in its description. If the background you choose doesn't provide a feat, you gain a bonus feat of your choice from the options below (both described in the "Player's Handbook"):

- [Skilled](Mechanics/feats/skilled.md)  
- [Tough](Mechanics/feats/tough.md)  

## Feats

This section introduces feats related to the forces of the planes. These feats are available to you whenever you normally choose a feat, and they follow the "feat rules" in the "Player's Handbook".

These feats are presented below.

- [Agent of Order](Mechanics/feats/agent-of-order-sato.md)  
- [Baleful Scion](Mechanics/feats/baleful-scion-sato.md)  
- [Cohort of Chaos](Mechanics/feats/cohort-of-chaos-sato.md)  
- [Outlands Envoy](Mechanics/feats/outlands-envoy-sato.md)  
- [Planar Wanderer](Mechanics/feats/planar-wanderer-sato.md)  
- [Righteous Heritor](Mechanics/feats/righteous-heritor-sato.md)  
- [Scion of the Outer Planes](Mechanics/feats/scion-of-the-outer-planes-sato.md)

## Magic

Magic on the planes largely functions as it does in other D&D settings, though some exceptions exist in Sigil (see "chapter 2"). The following sections present spells and magic items the DM can provide for planar travelers.

### Spells

The Spells table shows which classes can cast the spells in this section and the levels of those spells. The table also notes the school of magic of each spell.
