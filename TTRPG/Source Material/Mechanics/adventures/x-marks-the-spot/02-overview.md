# Overview
*Source: X Marks the Spot, p. 2* 

The Legion of Dusk is ruled by rituals that require its members to feed only from the blood of their foes. As such, the legion fortification known as Conqueror's Foothold houses prisoners—enemies of the state and others deemed ne'er-do-wells—who are slaughtered once every full moon.

At the start of the adventure, the characters find themselves imprisoned at Conqueror's Foothold and scheduled to be executed to feed their captors. Alante, a vampire cleric who administers last rites at the fort, aids them in a prison escape. She belongs to the Order of the Five Sacraments, and has been charged with opposing the aims of the Legion of Dusk.

Conqueror's Foothold is overseen by Vona, known as the Butcher of Magan. Vona has uncovered a map of the local region that shows the location of a powerful artifact known as the Hierophant's Chalice, hidden in the south of Ixalan at the Temple of Aclazotz. The Hierophant's Chalice is rumored to be able to create an endless supply of blood, making it potentially valuable to the vampires of the Legion of Dusk. A prophet named Arguel is rumored to have brought the chalice to the temple for unknown reasons, and Vona wishes to secure it.

In exchange for various favors—in addition to escaping from certain death—the adventurers have agreed to help Alante find the artifact first. Journeying across the island from Conqueror's Foothold to the Temple of Aclazotz takes several days, and brings the characters through dangerous territory and various random encounters.

As they seek the chalice, the characters meet a mad apostle who can lead them to it. At the lost temple that is the chalice's hiding place, the adventurers must face off against the demonic spawn of a bat-god. They are then able to wrest the chalice from the desiccated body of the prophet, who was led to the temple by the demon.
