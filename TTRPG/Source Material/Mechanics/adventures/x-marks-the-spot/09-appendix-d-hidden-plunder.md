|-----------|-----------------------|--|-------------|
| 1 | [Dowsing Dagger](Mechanics/items/dowsing-dagger-xmts.md) | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/XMtS/dowsing%20dagger.webp#center) | A curved jade blade fashioned by the River Heralds, this [+1 dagger](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) can detect the presence of fresh water within 200 feet of the wielder. |
| 2 | [Pirate's Cutlass](Mechanics/items/pirates-cutlass-xmts.md) | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/XMtS/pirates%20cutlass.webp#center) | This [+1 shortsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) is a terrifying weapon with a serrated edge. It grants its wielder advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks when brandished. |
| 3 | [Primal Amulet](Mechanics/items/primal-amulet-xmts.md) | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/XMtS/primal%20amulet.webp#center) | This beaded jade necklace bears an ancient symbol of the River Heralds. When worn, the primal amulet allows its wearer to cast [speak with animals](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-animals.md), [locate object](Mechanics/spells/locate-object.md), and [pass without trace](Mechanics/spells/pass-without-trace.md). Once the amulet has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. |

A creature looking through the sorcerous spyglass has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to detect things that can be seen. In addition, the user can view magical auras while looking through the spyglass, as if under the effect of a [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. |
| 6 | [Vanquisher's Banner](Mechanics/items/vanquishers-banner-xmts.md) | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/XMtS/vanquishers%20banner.webp#center) | This battle-worn but unbroken standard bears the insignia of one of the forces of the Legion of Dusk.
