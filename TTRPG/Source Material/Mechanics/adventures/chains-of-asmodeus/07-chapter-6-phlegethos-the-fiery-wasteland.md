# Chapter 6: Phlegethos, the Fiery Wasteland
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 109* 

![An infernal warship docks at Kordichai's manor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/108-0.webp#center)

Resembling the Elemental Plane of Fire, Phlegethos is the hottest layer of the Nine Hells and a fiery wasteland. The layer offers a traveler no respite from the flames and heat.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Phlegethos Overview" section. It provides you with the information you need to prepare for exploring this layer of the Nine Hells.

### Encounters

While on the Styx, remember to roll each day on the River Styx Encounters table in chapter 2, to see if the characters have one of those encounters. After they disembark from the barge, give them some time to explore. When they travel to or from The Elemental Preserve, or any other location they visit on this layer, roll on the Random Encounters in Phlegethos table.

**Random Encounters in Phlegethos**

`dice: [](07-chapter-6-phlegethos-the-fiery-wasteland.md#^random-encounters-in-phlegethos)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two [halogs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/halog-coa.md) (see appendix B) wade through the lava, occasionally sticking their snouts beneath the surface in search of food. |
| 2 | An infestation of two dozen [fire snakes](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) flees from five [barbed devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md) who hunt them. The vermin broke into an infernal store house and devoured a stockpile of weapons. The devils offer one [Soul Coin](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) for each head. |
| 3 | A pack of six [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md), led by a powerful [hellcat](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md) (see appendix B), roam the wastes looking for food. |
| 4 | Devils native to Phlegethos have frequent competitions called "fireflights," wherein the devils fly low and fast across the fiery plane. Each character must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a spined devil collides with them and the character falls, landing with the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition and taking 10 (`4d4`) piercing damage and 14 (`4d6`) fire damage. On a successful save, the character avoids the collision. If a collision occurs, the [spined devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/spined-devil.md) attacks, angry that the character has cost them the race. |
| 5 | A small group of experienced [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) lead travelers across Phlegethos and into Abriymoch proper. They claim to know the safest routes and offer their services for a platinum coin per person. If the characters pay this fee, they may travel to Abriymoch without any further random encounters. |
| 6 | Fire, smoke, and wind descend upon the wastes. Visibility becomes severely reduced, and creatures without fire resistance or immunity take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage at the start of each of their turns unless they find cover. The storm lasts `2d4` hours and halfway through its duration a rogue explosion occurs. This acts as if a [Fireball](Mechanics/spells/fireball.md) spell with a save DC of 20 has detonated, centered around one of the characters. |

### Locations

The characters need to make their way to The Elemental Preserve, to find the objectives summarized on the Objectives in Phlegethos table. They may want to explore some of the other locations within Phlegethos as well. Use the information in the "Key Locations in Phlegethos" section to guide them on an excursion through these areas.

### Koh Tam and Tiax

If the characters decide to visit areas other than The Elemental Preserve within Phlegethos, like the city of Abriymoch, have [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) offer to guide them.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) bounces around you with excited energy, seemingly jumping at the chance to stretch his legs. "Just you wait my friends, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is a big man in Phlegethos! [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) will come, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) will show you... "
^1a2

If the players take him up on his offer, roll on the Troubles with Tiax table in chapter 1.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your player's objectives and lead them to the corresponding areas to ensure they can complete their goals. Once the characters have explored the other areas within Phlegethos, make your way to The Elemental Preserve.

The following objectives can be attained in Phlegethos:

**Objectives in Phlegethos**

| Objective | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Phylactery of the sister | The Elemental Preserve: Hunting Lodge |
| Phylactery of the furnace | The Elemental Preserve: Hateli of the Storm's Realm |
| [Amulet of the Inferno](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-the-inferno-coa.md) | The Elemental Preserve: During "The Hunt" event |
| [Ranseur of Torture](Mechanics/items/ranseur-of-torture-coa.md) | The Elemental Preserve: During "The Hunt" event |
| [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) | The Elemental Preserve: The Labyrinth |
^objectives-in-phlegethos

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Phlegethos. You can of course have them encounter more if you want. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

## Phlegethos Overview

> [!gallery]
> ![Phlegethos, the Fourth Hell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/110-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/110-0.webp#gallery)

Much of the realm is dominated by the Molten Sea, a collection of fire, magma, and lava spanning thousands of miles. Due to its hostile environment, the only city on the layer is Abriymoch. Found inside the city is the Diabolical Court, the center of laws within the Nine Hells. Hellfire is also created on this layer, inside the Pit of Flame. Everything in Phlegethos, including the layer itself, is hostile to outsiders, and despite the nature of Abriymoch, travelers often perish here. Only devils and a few other types of creatures can survive this realm's extreme environment. Befitting the inferno of the realm, the River Styx enters through a volcanic portal from Minauros. It mingles with the lava inside the volcano and exits inside its molten rivers. A small layer of obsidian serves as the riverbank, which is also a bank to the lava river flowing alongside the flanks of the Styx. It passes many of the landmarks in the layer, including a dock just outside Abriymoch. As it passes the city, it begins to break from the lava and move deep into the rock, creating a spiraling tunnel system. This spiral leads all the way to Stygia, dropping in temperature the lower it goes.

Phlegethos gets its heat from the chain of volcanoes and molten fissures that cover its surface. Almost constant eruptions create rivers of fire and lava that pour into the Molten Sea. Sparse sections of rock make up the floor of the layer, which are blackened and searing to the touch. The air is superheated to the point that it occasionally bursts into balls of fire, and it smells of brimstone as a result. Navigating the realm is usually done via lava barges or flight, with the heated updrafts providing great lift to infernal airships.

Completely unique to the fiery realm, Phlegethos is ruled by two devils—[Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) and his daughter [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md). Despite occasional bickering and disagreements, the two rule the layer in relative harmony, and with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s approval.

![Even after the skies darke...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/111-0.webp#center "Even after the skies darken over Phelegethos, there is little respite from the oppressive heat.")

### Leaving Phlegethos

Despite being one of the most fortified layers, Phlegethos is possibly one of the easiest for extraplanar travel. There is a permanent portal maintained in Abriymoch, which, although heavily guarded and warded against intrusion, allows all manner of users for a price. It can navigate to other layers of the Nine Hells and is rumored even to have connections to other planes. Travelers can also attempt to traverse the Styx, though Phlegethos' stretch of the river suffers frequent pirate attacks and shakedowns.

### Features

Outside the city of Abriymoch, the heat is unmatched and overwhelming. Visitors take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage each hour they spend in the layer. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire are immune to this damage. Damage taken from exposure to Phlegethos hostile environment doesn't interrupt rests unless it would cause a creature to have the [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition.

## Key Locations in Phelegethos

Some of the major locations found in Phelegethos are described below.

### Abriymoch

Standing as the lone marker of civilization within the layer, Abriymoch is a dangerously beautiful city regarded as one of the finest by much of the devil community. In addition to containing the Diabolical Court, which is the only official judicial system in the Nine Hells, the city holds avenues for exploring every sin imaginable. Its streets are magma canals navigated by barges, which lead to numerous shops, taverns, brothels, casinos, theaters, and other pleasurable establishments. While outsiders are generally not welcome within the city, devils from all nine layers flock to it during their downtime.

A gondolier is essential to navigate the magma channels. The gondolier can take the characters to a variety of shops where they can purchase standard equipment, all of it suitably devilish in appearance. It costs 100 gp for an hour of the gondolier's time, but because several devils owe [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) favors when he accompanies the characters, the ride is free.

If [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) accompanies them, the first time they reach a destination, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The gnome practically leaps onto the sidewalk from the magma sprayed vessel. Once on more solid surface, he claps his hands loudly. "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) promises big and [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) delivers big! I present to you the city of Abriymoch, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s city, yes indeed!"
^1aa

> [!note] Temptation of Pride
> 
> ***"Gaining the Advantage"***
> 
> At any point during their time in Abriymoch, a bone devil approaches and offers to etch a magic tattoo onto one of the characters. The cost is a mere 600 gp. If they agree, review the appropriate temptation event in chapter 2.
^temptation-of-pride

### The Pit of Flame

One of the most dangerous locations in all the Nine Hells is contained within Phlegethos: The Pit of Flame. It can be found in the caldera of an ancient super volcano in the center of the layer. Since its discovery, a massive building has been constructed atop the pit. Metal bars crisscross along the top, with balls of infernal steel hanging on chains just above the lake of fire. Barbazus oversee the maintenance and construction of additional layers, while other devils operate the spheres and see to their prisoners. Here, with temperatures harmful even to devils, prisoners from every layer are being tortured. Ascension ceremonies and ritualistic sufferings also take place within the Pit of Flame, making it an extremely revered location within the Nine Hells.

While prisoners dangle overhead, the lower portions of the pit contain numerous walkways and at times serve as a place of pilgrimage for devils (and others) who travel from great distances to observe and revere the suffering all around.

### The Elemental Preserve

The Elemental Preserve is a hunting ground ruled over by a pit fiend named Kordichai. His hunting expeditions are legendary and devils across the Nine Hells covet the rare invitation. When the characters enter Phlegethos, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) should mention the preserve. Review "The Elemental Preserve" adventure section to answer any questions the characters might ask [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) about that location.

> [!note] Temptation of Murder
> 
> ***"The Heretic Priest"***
> 
> A priest of an opposing faith to one of the characters (select the most faithful among the party) is speaking with a [succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md). If the party spends any amount of time eavesdropping, then run "The Heretic Priest" event from chapter 2.
^temptation-of-murder

## Adventure: The Elemental Preserve

If the characters profess an interest in entering The Elemental Preserve, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) (or another appropriate NPC) explains that the story of the preserve is the story of the pit fiend, Baron Kordichai, now an esteemed lieutenant of [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md). Kordichai was not always a great magnate of the Nine Hells, but that rare thing: a devil that progressed over the centuries through successively more powerful forms as his services to his superiors were recognized.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Kordichai was a hunter of truant mortals and spent much of his past existence outside the Nine Hells, braving the climes of other planes as he tracked down resourceful souls who had contrived to escape their appointment with the powers below. No soul was safe, and he upheld the twisted honor of the Nine Hells by making a succession of the mighty understand that the contracts of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) are truly ironbound. And then he was promoted and given a region of Phlegethos to watch over, the Elemental Preserve. Now his role is one of tedious administration where he oversees ambitious young devils who venture into other planes to do what was once his job."
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) smiles slightly as he continues, "Rumor has it that the entire promotion was [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md)'s joke on the vainglorious baron. He was, she decided, having far too much fun, and as the regent of jealousy it was her responsibility to ensure nobody was having a better time than she was. Kordichai's reaction to his new post surprised even [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md), though. Kordichai lives for the hunt and so he transformed his part of the Nine Hells into what is now called the Elemental Preserve. A place where Kordichai leads hunting expeditions that are so popular that devils across the Nine Hells covet the opportunity to be invited."
^1b0

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s advice to the characters is as follows:

- If the characters are to have any chance of finding what they're looking for they need to meet Kordichai. If they make a good impression, he might invite them on his current hunt which will be akin to a guided tour of the Preserve by the devil that knows it best. In addition, his hunts are often joined by one of the rulers of Phlegethos—[Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) or [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md). Getting a meeting with the pit fiend will cost many [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) or gold.  
- Alternatively, they could try to contact the poor souls who are the prey of Kordichai's current hunt. These mortals have had to learn the lay of the land or die quickly to Kordichai's predations.  

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) gives them an infernal map. Show the players the map of the Elemental Preserve in appendix F. They can use this map to decide which points of interest they want to explore. Refer to the "Using an Infernal Map" section of chapter 2. A failed or successful Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to use this map has a 50 percent chance of triggering an encounter on the Hunt Random Encounters table. Prior to "Kordichai's Hunt" roll a `d8` to determine the encounter from the table; after the hunt begins roll a `d12`.

### Kordichai's Hunting Obsession

Having spent so long outside the Nine Hells, in the company of non-devils, Kordichai is as close to eccentric as a denizen of the inferno can become. Kordichai lives for the hunt. He bitterly envies the mortals who get to live and die and truly risk themselves against the great monsters of their worlds, who are all mere puppies and kittens to a great Fiend like himself. Wealth and power in the Nine Hells mean very little to him compared to the thrill of the chase. And so Kordichai decided that if he couldn't travel to hunt, he'd bring the hunt home to him. Of course, the searing fields of Phlegethos are hostile territories for most of the great monsters the planes can boast, so Kordichai—through the calling in of a great many favors—opened a portal that decanted the entire contents of a swathe of the Plane of Fire out into his territory in the Nine Hells.

Between the shores of the molten sea and the basalt canal walls of the Styx he built his wildlife preserve, stocked with Elemental creatures of all kinds. He raised mountains and sunk chasms, had sweating teams of minor devils dig artificial lakes and channels for the lava to roll into, even had them plant whole flaming forests of elemental trees that burn forever without turning to ash, releasing searing seeds buoyed on the eternal updrafts. In seeking to create a hunting ground, Kordichai also inadvertently created a place of eerie and violent beauty within Phlegethos' burning wastes.

The portal that created the Preserve was open for only a moment, but flickers at the heart of the wilderness from time to time, allowing brief communication between the Nine Hells and the Plane of Fire, which might or might not count as an escape depending on who the putative escapee is.

### The Elemental Preserve Locations

The preserve is a sprawling landscape, dotted with hunting lodges, fire creatures, and devils on the hunt. The characters most likely leave their vessel on the River Styx and embark onto one of the many flying barges leading to Kordichai's Manor (area E4). Alternatively, they might try to travel over the hostile landscape and either find a hunting lodge (area E1) or search for any creatures being hunted by Korichai's other guests.

#### E1: Hunting Lodge

As well as his floating barges, Kordichai maintains a number of hunting lodges of incandescent iron dotted across the Preserve, staffed by [barbed devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md) and [pain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pain-devil-excruciarch-coa.md) (see appendix B) and stocked with food, drink, and souls for the refreshment of his guests. Here he keeps his trophies, the blazing horns and tusks and wall-mounted heads of his greatest kills—both the fiery beasts of the preserves and those he hunted down on further planes. Visitors have surprised Kordichai staring almost wistfully at the echoes of his past deeds.

##### The Phylactery of the Sister

If one of the characters is seeking the phylactery with their sister's soul, they find it crammed among Kordichai's many trophies at the first hunting lodge they enter. If Kordichai accompanies them and they try to steal the phylactery, they must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. If he isn't present, they can take it without anyone noticing. Likewise, if they simply ask Kordichai for it, he admits to not knowing why it is among his trophies—he is willing to give it to them in exchange for the head of any creature the characters slay in The Elemental Preserve.

Once the character has taken possession of the phylactery of their sister, they gain the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

> [!note] Temptation of Jealousy
> 
> ***"The Jealous Beauty"***
> 
> If the characters have already had an encounter at this hunting lodge, save this temptation event for the next hunting lodge they discover. Otherwise, a [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) currently enjoying the fine refreshments smiles broadly upon seeing one of the characters. The devil offers the characters a blessing, no strings attached. Review "The Jealous Beauty" temptation event from chapter 2.
^temptation-of-jealousy

#### E2: Hateli of the Storm's Realm

The Elemental Preserve isn't entirely the unchallenged territory of Fiends. Kordichai perhaps received a little more than he bargained for when he stole away a great stretch of the Plane of Fire. A community of efreet has its home somewhere in the wilds, established in caves and ambushing unwary devils. Trapped for generations, they've since found their way to the portal and been able to cross sporadically back and forth to their home. Their leader, Hateli of the Storm, has sworn vengeance on all of the Nine Hells for the desecration wreaked against the Firelands. She and her people remain in the Preserve by choice, sabotaging the devils where they can. Kordichai is well aware of them but considers their efforts an additional spice to his hunts. While efreet are usually almost as unwelcome as devils to a mortal, Hateli has been known to shelter and aid those cut loose in the Preserve purely to spite the devils. Hateli ([efreeti](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) with 250 hit points) is accompanied by `1d4` [efreet](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) and `2d4` [salamanders](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md).

##### The Phylactery of the Furnace

A character seeking their soul may find it in the possession of Hateli. A wretched creature, vaguely resembling the character, is forced to shovel coal into a massive furnace. If the creature ever falters, Hateli lashes out at it with her whip. If the character expresses outrage, or demands their soul returned, Hateli offers them a simple exchange.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Hunt the hunter and bring me the pit fiend's head and I shall return what is yours." The efreeti extends her hand with the offer. "Do we have a bargain?"
^1b9

> [!note] The Infernal Bracer
> 
> Kordichai has hastened [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md)'s fall by fastening a bracer forged from infernal iron about her left forearm. While wearing this bracer, [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) is cursed, seeing all other creatures as devils that she must slay. The bracer also makes [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) immune to any magic that might otherwise bring her back to her senses. [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) isn't aware of the bracer and even if she were, she can't remove it or destroy it herself.
> 
> The characters can target the bracer with melee or ranged attacks (AC 18; 50 hit points; immunity to cold, fire, poison and psychic damage; resistance to all other damage types). If [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) is [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled), [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), attacks made against the bracer are made with advantage.
^the-infernal-bracer

If the characters bring Kordichai's head to Hateli, the efreeti fulfills her end of the deal, extinguishes the furnace, and returns their phylactery to them. If the party fights the efreet instead, even, after slaying them all, the soul continues shoveling fuel into the furnace.

If the characters ever stop the creature from shoveling coal it whimpers and then vanishes. A moment later there is a shriek and the creature reappears, scrambling out of the furnace. Any other creature that enters the furnace, or starts their turn within the furnace, takes 78 (`12d12`) fire damage.

Only once those fires are dimmed forever, is the soul released. This requires a combined total of 100 points of cold damage, inflicted upon the furnace. At that point, the furnace's inferno is finally dampened, and the character recovers their phylactery.

#### E3: Anagwendol's Prison

In the center of the preserve stalks perhaps the most dangerous creature. For therein is the prison that both holds the deva [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) and keeps the rest of the preserve safe from her. Grown mad by her captivity, she has become the ultimate hunter, slaying anything that enters the bewildering tunnels in which Kordichai imprisoned her. More information about [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) can be found in appendix C.

As the characters approach the location:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dome of earth rises above the lava and gloom. It is a natural thing, if such can ever be said of this place, formed by the cooling of lava, a nest of tunnels not unlike the intestines of a poor creature cut apart and lain across the fiery landscape. Even from the outside the twists and turns seem impossible to make sense of. Tunnels curve left then right, others rise upwards, before twisting their way downwards. It is impossible not to see the many charred and cracked bones, a veritable graveyard marring the only visible entrance into the maze.
^1bc

The characters must search the maze, where they inevitably run into [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) because she begins to hunt them the moment they enter her domain. She is a swift and dangerous hunter. Kordichai has broken her. He has also placed an infernal bracer around her left forearm that prevents any magic from ending [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md)'s never-ending torment. Only once that bracer has been destroyed (see sidebar) can [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) be freed.

But first they must overcome her. At the end of each hour meandering through the dark, twisting tunnels, roll a `d4` (adding 1 for each previous roll). Once the result is 4 or higher, [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) strikes. She emerges from hiding, and if not detected, she grapples a character and carries them straight upwards, through a vertical tunnel, depositing them in a chamber 60 feet above their companions. She then attacks them. If she slays her victim, she repeats the ambush `1d4` hours later against another character.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/115-0.webp#gallery)

##### The Hunt

If her captives are helped by allies—or if she fails to surprise the characters—she fights for 3 rounds, then attempts to disappear down one of the hallways. Whenever the characters lose sight of her, they must track her, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

The second time they encounter her, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Vile devils, come to torture me some more?" The tormented deva before you hisses, her eyes glazed, as if not truly seeing you. Her silvery skin is covered with scars and puckered wounds, grime, and blood. A battered bracer covers her left forearm, glowing with a reddish hue. Her wing feathers droop and look as if some animal has gnawed at their tips. She raises a blood-crusted greatsword. "I'll slay all the legions of the Nine Hells if I must. You shall be stopped." And with that, she leaps to the attack.
^1be

She tries to slay any injured characters, but won't retreat, unless it is tactically the best thing for her to do. She'll eventually stand her ground and fight to the death, and this is the characters' best opportunity to destroy the bracer and free her from her torment.

When [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md) is freed from the curse she gains four levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). This [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) cannot be cured while she remains in the Nine Hells. If the characters don't use the ritual that the Hellriders taught them to free her immediately, she accompanies them to [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge.

##### Treasure

Among the debris in her prison, the heroes find 2,500 gp and 325 pp.

#### E4: Kordichai's Manor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> If all the greatest and most luxurious hunting lodges of the mortal world were swept up into one structure, it wouldn't be half so impressive as Kordichai's manor. The sprawling building is made of stone and has several floors, each circled by a shaded balcony, and wide glass windows. Even from a distance you see the giant bones and polished antlers that have been worked into the exterior design, framing doorways, and curling up from along the pointed rooftops. You have no doubt that the interior of the manor will be decorated with pelts and taxidermized beasts. This is the home of a hunter.
^1c1

Anyone approaching the manor is intercepted by two [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md), each with a pack of four [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md). They demand that intruders turn back, but a donation of 5 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) or 4,000 gp convinces them to set up an audience with Kordichai. Proceed to "An Important Audience" in the "Kordichai's Hunt" section below.

### Kordichai's Hunt

Prior to the hunt, the characters must have an audience with Kordichai, the outcome of which determines their role in the upcoming hunt.

#### An Important Audience

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Your escort brings you before a powerful looking pit fiend, sitting on a massive chair built from the bones of prey from past hunts. A curious grin flickers across his face. "Who is this that stands so recklessly before me? Tell me, are you here to hunt, or to be hunted?"
^1c4

An audience with Kordichai can go four ways depending on how convincing the characters are. Have them make a Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check and based on the result, one of the following occurs:

- **Rolled 25 or Higher.** Kordichai is amenable to many suggestions, including setting up a 'hunting accident' for [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) or [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md).  
- **Rolled 20–24.** Kordichai is greatly impressed with the characters, and they get an invitation to become members of his hunt.  
- **Rolled 15–19.** Kordichai feels that they might be worthy of joining his team of beaters.  
- **Rolled 14 or Lower.** Kordichai has them surrounded. He tells them that their reward for  wasting his time is that they get to be added to the hunt.  

Once the result is determined review the following sections describing the hunters, beaters, and prey. Consult the appropriate sidebar, given the party's result from their audience with Kordichai.

#### Members of the Hunt

Kordichai leads hunting expeditions over his lands, invitations to which are quite the coveted commodity among the devil nobility. What would normally be an unforgivably erratic nature in a senior Fiend becomes acceptable entertainment when he leads a party of jaded devils to hunt prey from levitating barges of searing bronze. From their decks the great devils connive, gossip and scheme, broker deals, gorge on luxuries, and enjoy the screaming as infernal engineers pour a wealth of shrieking souls into the boilers below. The rails of the barges are lined with ballistae from which cackling aristocrats launch projectiles with tips of barbed ice guaranteed to cause the elemental fauna as much pain as possible. Following a wounded Elemental and tormenting it until it expires, is absolutely the done thing—before ripping free some trophy for later bragging rights.

The hunt consists of Kordichai ([pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md)), a [horned devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md), a [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B) and either [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) or [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md). With one of the two rulers present, characters may have an opportunity to steal one of their artifacts from them (see the end of this chapter for further details).

##### The Characters as Hunters

This is a rare opportunity for the characters to interact with an archdevil directly. Both are willing to talk with the characters, though are amused at the presence of mortals among the other hunters.

As members of the hunt, the characters may use the ballista on the barge, or leave the safety of the barge to face the prey directly. Each hour roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table to see what the hunters discover.

##### Ballista Bolt

Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (`3d10`) cold damage. A creature with fire resistance or immunity is considered vulnerable to the damage of this bolt.

#### Beaters of the Hunt

Every hunt needs a team of beaters to rouse the prey so that the hunters can have their fun. A selection of devils, powerful outsiders and even particularly wicked mortal rangers are recruited into Kordichai's service for this purpose. He even barters for the souls of those who were formally his hunting companions, recruiting them into eternal service as his beaters and wardens.

##### The Characters as Beaters

As beaters, the characters join a group that includes a [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md), a pair of [azers](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/azer.md), a [salamander](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) and a tiefling [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). These beaters follow the leadership of whoever the characters appoint as captain. Their job is to drive the prey toward Kordichai's barge. To do this, they need to spread out in a formation that has them 30 feet away from the nearest beater. Every hour, the designated captain must make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. Success results in a roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table. Each failure angers Kordichai. Three failures in a row and Kordichai calls the hunt off and sends a halfdozen [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) to dispose of the beaters. The characters are now treated as 'prey' and should use the appropriate encounters during the remainder of their exploration of the preserve.

#### The Mortal Prey

As well as hunting powerful creatures, Kordichai has other cruel pastimes on the Preserve. Bands of valiant mortals who brave the Nine Hells are sometimes brought to him for disposal, and he releases them into the searing wilds of the Preserve. Each is given some trinket that wards off the heat and the choking air, but only for a limited period. The wretched mortals are told of the portal to the Plane of Fire that might allow them escape from the Nine Hells (though not whether it is open at this particular point in time) and set loose. Shortly after, Kordichai, his beaters, and guests start their own hunt, in the air or on foot. He particularly appreciates it when his victims turn on each other and fight over the protective trinkets. In cases where there is only one runner left at the end, Kordichai normally grants the fugitive the honor of single combat, a risk that raises infernal eyebrows but at least provides entertainment one way or the other.

##### The Characters as Prey

If Kordichai designates the characters as prey, then they're told of a location in the Preserve where they can meet the other prey. If the characters are looking for the prey on their own, they can use divination magic or tracking—a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check—to locate them. The prey consists of a human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), elf [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), dwarf [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) and tiefling [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md). They look to the characters for leadership. They know some of the locations and denizens of the Preserve, including the hunting lodges, the [efreeti](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) and the [Eriflamme](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eriflamme-coa.md). Each hour, the prey must make a DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to avoid the dangers of the Preserve. Failure means a roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table. A failure of 10 or less means that Kordichai's barge has found them. They can also try to find a specific location or denizen such as a hunting lodge. This requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, but also means that they can't avoid the dangers and so must roll on the Hunt Random Encounters table, even if they succeed.

##### The Trinkets

Each of the hunted is given an amulet. Once worn, it grants them immunity to fire damage for three hours. After which point the amulet smolders then disintegrates. The other prey only have two hours remaining before they begin taking fire damage. The characters can choose when to wear their trinkets.

#### The Hunt

The various events and outcomes for the hunt are determined by rolling on the following table. For each hour of the hunt (or when directed to do so), roll a `d12` and consult the table. If the characters are being hunted, then they also roll on this table every hour. If the characters earlier discovered a particular creature while exploring the Elemental Preserve (and did not kill it), and they're now attempting to find that creature again, they may return to that location directly without rolling on the table.

Each encounter should only occur once. If an encounter is rolled again, use the next lowest number. If there are no valid encounters, then use the next highest number.

##### Hunting Lodge

A number of hunting lodges of incandescent iron can be found across the Preserve (see area E1). This result can be rolled more than once–as there are several lodges.

##### Efreet

In the caves dotted across the wilds a community of efreet has made its home (see area E2).

##### Dragons

This aspect of the hunt has made Kordichai particularly hated by the queen of dragons, Tiamat. He has a breeding pair of red dragons that he uses to keep the preserve well stocked. When a team of beaters successfully rouses a nest of [young red dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md), four of them attack.

##### Fire Kraken

The [fire kraken](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-kraken-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) are among the most dangerous creatures in the Nine Hells and there's one in Kordichai's preserve.

##### Phoenix

A single [phoenix](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/phoenix-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) is encountered.

##### Mortal Prey/Kordichai's Hunt

If the characters are hunters, then the barge comes across a bedraggled group of prey (see the section, "The Mortal Prey"). The outcome is certain, but Kordichai wishes to make them suffer before he and his companions snuff out their lives. If the characters are being hunted, they spy Kordichai's barge and can set up an ambush.

##### Eriflamme

Dragons and phoenixes may not be the most dangerous denizens of the Preserve. There remains one beast hidden across the many miles of wilderness that Kordichai has hunted but never caught. A thing of guile and power and stealth hiding in the brightness and ambushing the unwary, it is neither an Elemental nor a Fiend but allegedly a creature formed of the two different planes meeting. The [Eriflamme](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eriflamme-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block), as it has become known, is said to resemble a perpetually blazing tarrasque formed of interlocking Elementals all tessellated together. It is malleable, capable of breaking apart into a host of individual bodies and forming again at will. Track it as he might, Kordichai has never brought the monster to bay. Only the twisted wreckage of barges, the ruin of lodges, and the bodies of his servants testify to its existence and its power. Over time, Kordichai has grown more and more obsessed with this one elusive denizen of his Preserve, taking greater and greater risks, even shirking his duties at the slightest suggestion it has made an appearance.

##### Hunting Accident

Even as Abriymoch is the preferred destination for devils from all over the Nine Hells seeking off-duty entertainment, so a place on Kordichai's hunts is the prize for any infernal notable. Needless to say, his superiors [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) and [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) are constantly foisting less than suitable guests on him, sometimes because they wish to genuinely reward an underling or curry favor with magnates from other layers of the Nine Hells, alternatively because they wish to make a fool of some pompous upstart they know is ill-equipped to keep up with Kordichai's hectic pace. Devils have been killed on his hunts, sometimes in hunting accidents and occasionally—should [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) give Kordichai the word—in 'hunting accidents'. Everyone knows it happens, and that only adds to the thrill of the chase. If the characters have persuaded Kordichai to set up an ambush on [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) or [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md), then this is when he makes his move.

#### Fighting Devils

Attacking [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) or [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) without Kordichai's support is likely a losing battle, but some characters may have powerful incentives urging them forward.

##### Deathstalkers—Obtaining Belial's Ranseur of Torture or Fierna's Amulet of the Inferno

The hunt is the only opportunity where the characters can gain possession of either of these two powerful artifacts. But it requires outsmarting an archdevil or killing one.

![A Hunting Lodge.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/121-0.webp#center)

At any time, the characters might attempt to use trickery to obtain the item (such as casting a spell like [Telekinesis](Mechanics/spells/telekinesis.md) to steal one of the artifacts right off their persons). But it is challenging to do so without the archdevil or witnesses noticing.

There may also be particular moments during the hunt to obtain the item:

- **The Characters Are Hunters.** If the characters have joined the hunt, it wouldn't be difficult to convince the archdevil to separate from the others. Both [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) and [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) are often bored, and either may seize any chance to disrupt things.  
- **As Beaters.** Once prey is engaged, the characters might try to attack the archdevil when they join the hunt. Or prior to engagement they might set a trap for the archdevil.  
- **As Prey.** If the characters are being hunted, they would need to set up an ambush, preferably with the other prey as allies. [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md)'s prison (area E3) is a good location for an ambush.  

If the characters attack [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) or [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) (see appendix A for both), Kordichai and any allies defend the archdevil (unless a betrayal has been previously negotiated). During a fight, the optional disarm rules, found in the "Combat Options" section within the "Dungeon Master's Guide" might also allow the characters to steal the artifact rather than finish a likely losing battle against an archdevil.
