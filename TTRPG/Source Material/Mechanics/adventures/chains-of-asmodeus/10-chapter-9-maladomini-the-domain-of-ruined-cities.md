# Chapter 9: Maladomini, the Domain of Ruined Cities
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 149* 

![The Eye Market looms over the surrounding streets.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/148-0.webp#center)

Once the most beautiful layer in the Nine Hells, Maladomini has since fallen to ruin due to the overzealous actions of its ruler. In an attempt to return his realm to beauty, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) orders the construction of a new city every few years. When these inevitably don't meet his standard of perfection, he abandons the city and starts anew. The entire layer is now covered in a thick, toxic smog, and sickly black ichor oozes from everything. Hidden behind the smog is a ruby-red sky, blackening the higher it gets. Despite all this, Maladomini remains the only layer with an official school, and many of the intelligent devils call it home.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Maladomini Overview" section. You can use the information in this section to guide your players through the different attractions this layer has to offer.

### Encounters

During their travels across Maladomini the characters encounter some of the devils that call this place their home. Roll at least once on the Random Encounters in Maladomini table whilst here.

### Locations

If the characters want to explore some of the other locations in Maladomini, the "Key Locations in Maladomini" section will help you set the scene. There is much to see, as Maladomini is forever being developed, with new cities rising every few years that rival the might of the ones that came before. Two of the cities the characters might choose to visit: Grenpoli and Gorloron. The city of Grenpoli serves as a welcome safe haven for many. Within its walls all forms of aggression are forbidden. The city of Gorloron, the latest of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s vanity projects, will no doubt be surpassed by an even more ambitious metropolis in the future. Besides the cities, the characters can explore the Carnival Eternal. There are many lethal thrills to be found within, and as the characters stroll across the carnival grounds, devils cry out to tempt them to go on the carnival's Hellish rides.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your player's objectives and lead them to the corresponding areas to ensure they can complete their goals. Once done exploring, they need to make their way to the Eye Market. Here they can find some of the items and souls they're searching for.

The following objectives can be attained in Maladomini:

**Objective in Maladomini**

| Objective | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Phylactery of the great con | Eye Market: Ganglands (Memnoriac's territory) |
| Phylactery of the spouse | Eye Market: Ganglands (Ilkatar's territory) |
| [Staff of the Woodlands](Mechanics/items/staff-of-the-woodlands.md) | Eye Market: The Slums |
| [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) | Eye Market |
^objective-in-maladomini

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Maladomini. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

## Maladomini Overview

> [!gallery]
> ![Maladomini, the Seventh Hell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/150-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/150-0.webp#gallery)

The River Styx enters the realm through a massive canyon that stretches to Malbolge. The river moves from the canyon into a massive subterranean cave system, where it avoids the exploitation of the surface for some time before emerging from underground and exposing the smog covered sky to those sailing its waters.

During its heyday, Maladomini was a beautiful paradise, with varying biomes and lush vegetation. Sadly, the only forests that remain are either decaying or dead, with no wildlife or beauty to be found. In between the deforestation lie strip mines, surface mines, and processing facilities that belch smog and toxins into the air. Any water that once existed has turned to sludge, save only for the secluded Styx. The layer is truly a testament to [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s failure in his search for perfection.

Each of the ruins covering the realm is more spectacular than the last. During their construction, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) wanted each to be his ultimate metropolis and spared no expense. Even in their detritus they remain grotesquely beautiful. Occasional treasure hunters from other planes explore the ruins in search of treasure, and many escaped devils or souls hide deep inside. The overexploitation of the surrounding lands makes the ruins some of the safest spots in the layer, and they remain largely forgotten by the ruling archdevil.

Despite his disloyalty to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) remains the archdevil in charge of Maladomini. His rule is assisted by other powerful archdevils, including [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md). [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) is driven towards perfecting his realm and many construction projects are constantly underway. Devils not working on the various construction projects prefer life in the domed city of Grenpoli.

### Leaving Maladomini

The only known way in or out of Maladomini is the Styx, though rumors claim other entrances and exits exist. Because of the stream of devils entering and exiting the realm for training and schooling, scholars believe there to be a hidden infernal passageway that connects the layer to the rest of the Nine Hells. Explorers also claim that the cave system the Styx passes through has connections to other layers, though such connections have yet to be found. Besides, if one can brave the cave systems, the Styx is a relatively easy method of travel.

### Features

Although Maladomini remains one of the safer layers, the influence of the Lord of the Flies remains powerful. Whenever a creature is asked a question, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically compelled to tell a lie, stretch the truth, or avoid answering—anything that would prevent the truth from being told.

## Key Locations in Maladomini

The characters need to make their way to the Eye Market but may want to spend some time in the other locations found in Maladomini. Use the information below to guide their excursion.

> [!note] Temptation of Betrayal
> 
> ***"If I Could Read Your Mind"***
> 
> The characters are approached by a devil that offers them the ability to read the thoughts of someone important to them for the cost of 1 [Soul Coin](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) and 800 gp. If one of the characters is tempted, run the appropriate temptation event from chapter 2.
^temptation-of-betrayal

### City of Grenpoli

Unique to Maladomini and known throughout the Nine Hells is Grenpoli, the City of Diplomacy. All forms of aggression or weapons are forbidden within the city, and a powerful spell suppresses violence when it would occur. Upon entering the city through one of its four gates, visitors are searched, and their weapons confiscated. These will only be returned once their visit to the city has ended. Grenpoli contains the Political College of the Nine Hells, which offers devils courses in deception, manipulation, and negotiation. Located just outside the city is Offalion, a training facility that enacts large-scale scenarios to train devils, testing and enhancing their ability to barter effectively with mortals. These exercises prepare a multitude of devils for delicate excursions into the Material Plane.

### City of Gorloron

![A flying fortress oversees...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/151-0.webp#center "A flying fortress oversees the construction of Gorloron.")

[Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s "greatest" city of the moment is Gorloron, which contains his seat of power and much of the devil population in the realm. The city's construction is still underway, and the place is utter chaos.

> [!note] Temptation of Oppression
> 
> ***"A Palace Fit for a King"***
> 
> Here in the (current) capital of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s realm, you can't throw a stone without hitting an architect. All are vying to gain favor from the tormented archdevil and to convince him to let them build bigger and better. One of these architects approaches the characters, explaining that his latest proposal was rejected once more. It is desperate for work and offers to build the characters a fortress or a temple in their name. The price is 3 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) and 2,000 gp (a rare magic item brings the price down to 500 gp). If any of the characters take the devil up on their offer run the appropriate temptation event from chapter 2.

![Visitors must dock their s...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/152-0.webp#center "Visitors must dock their ships outside the gates of Grenpoli.")

### Carnival Eternal

Also of note is the Carnival Eternal, which is a terrifying and absurd amusement park built to reward successful devils. If the characters have not yet encountered the "Ruin and Amusement" random encounter (see chapter 2), feel free to run that now if the characters explore the Carnival Eternal.

### The Eye Market

This dangerous area is nestled in the center of a ring of partly abandoned buildings, all of it the turf of various factions vying for control.

## Adventure: The Eye Market

The Eye Market is run by an odd couple—a mind flayer and a beholder. For the right price, they will replace the eyes of a customer with new jeweled eyes of great magical power.

If asked about the Eye Market, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) has this to say:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Maladomini is the layer of deceit but none are more deceived perhaps than its master, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) himself who ruins every part of it in a vain attempt to create a wonder of beauty that will put the other planes to shame. Constantly beginning and then abandoning his increasingly ambitious projects, he leaves behind a polluted waste of dead forests, toxic water, and the shells of half-completed palaces, castles and cities, each abandoned as it fails to meet its architect's impossible standards." He gestures at the debris of the various unfinished projects that litter the landscape.
> 
> "In one particularly expansive cityscape comprised of a labyrinth of roofless houses, half-raised towers, and foundations of great works, there in the shadow of a ruined dome surely too grand ever to have been completed, squats the Eye Market, the underside of Maladomini. A festering secret hidden under the nose of the layer's archdevil, a siren's lure to all those exhausted by the hideous waste of the layer. Because there is salvation to be had there, of a kind. If the sights of Maladomini offend your eyes, the devils say, then pluck them out. My intuition tells me you should venture to the Market next."
^253

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) warns the characters to be careful while on the streets around the Eye Market. He can also offer the following advice:

- The Eye Market is the name for the entirety of the neighborhood surrounding the specialty store in the inner district operated by strange beings known as Vaness and Fling. It is also the name of their store.  
- Rival gangs of devils roam and control various portions of the Eye Market, and it would be best to not get mixed up in their turf war.  

This is a location well known to many travelers and [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) can provide a standard map of the Eye Market (see appendix F) to the characters. They can then use this map to decide which route they want to take to reach Vaness' and Fling's shop (area M6).

### The Law

Watching over the streets around the Eye Market is Akrekarn, the closest this morass has to the law. A [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B) retired from a life of blackmailing mortals, Akrekarn patrols the streets around the market with a writ from [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), allegedly enforcing the archdevil's will but in truth simply shaking down locals and visitors for all he can get. He is more than ready to have his mob of infernal deputies (six [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md)) seize anyone who won't bow the knee or proffer a bribe, taking them to be tormented, sold, or ransomed as he thinks best. When not terrorizing the streets, Akrekarn takes his unspeakable pleasures in the one completed building in the city, a guard house he has made his headquarters. Or else he is to be found at the Eye Market itself, shaking down the proprietors and reminding them that they operate only on sufferance.

> [!note] An Eye for Opportunity
> 
> There are watchful eyes everywhere and the moment characters attack either Ilkatar, Memnoriac, or Jacelisk, Akrekarn is informed. Before the battle finishes, he arrives in an infernal airship, a gift from [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), accompanied by his bodyguard of six bearded devils. He doesn't interfere with the battle but if the characters are victorious, he takes control of the vacated gang-leader's territory and won't permit passage until he's gotten approval from [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md). Akrekarn makes it clear that attacking him will bring on the archdevil's wrath.
> 
> If the characters are defeated, he takes half of the character's belongings from the gang-leader, to store in his headquarters. Details for the airship can be found in the Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" except that Akrekarn's vehicle requires half the crew and accommodates only half the number of passengers.

### Eye Market Locations

![Akrekarn imposes the law o...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/155-0.webp#center "Akrekarn imposes the law on the streets outside the Eye Market.")

The characters must navigate dangerous streets to get to the Eye Market. However, if they keep their wits about them, they may just find what they're looking for.

#### M1: Outer Streets

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Like the great corpse of a whale sunken to the sea floor, the city around you is at once both utterly dead and teeming with life—scavengers and parasites all contending for a scrap of flesh. You see them in the darkened corners of winding alleyways and the entrances of crumbling doorways. Watching. Waiting. Below your feet the pavement is potholed and hazardous and dilapidated structures loom all around like giant bones picked clean, haunted by the revenant of intended greatness.
^259

Reaching the market is easier said than done. The convoluted streets of the abandoned city it nestles within are fraught with peril around every turn. Desperate lost souls and minor devils, cut loose from the hierarchy of the Nine Hells, throng there—most bitterly seeking the unique service the Eye Market can provide but unable to pay the fee. Every hollow shell of a building hides a nest of wretches preying on each other, scrabbling in the mulch, or descending into the monster-haunted and unsound sewers of the place in the hopes of finding something of value.

> [!note] Dangerous Territory
> 
> There are dozens of smaller gangs in the broken streets around the Eye Market, but the current major players are Ilkatar's Brood, Jacelisk's Knives, and Memnoriac. To reach the Eye Market (area M6), the characters must walk through, or fly over, one of the ganglands. Each major gang demands tribute to allow the characters passage through their territory. See the following descriptions about what each gang demands but the head of a rival gang-leader is also suitable tribute for any gang.
> 
> If any characters attempt to fly over gang territory, that gang challenges them in the air instead. Any descriptive text in the following sections will need to be adjusted if this occurs.
^dangerous-territory

A variety of gangs preside over this layer of scum, extorting prices of souls, flesh, and labor from those on their turf. This being the Nine Hells, of course, it isn't a dog-eat-dog chaos, but a knifeedged dance of diplomacy, custom, and expectation. Every gang is the heart of a web of alliances and carefully negotiated territorial arrangements, all of which contain hidden get-out clauses and exceptions that allow them to be shrugged off at any moment. The devils live strung between two poles, constantly living as though their word is their bond, yet ready to exploit loopholes to betray their fellows at every step.

#### M2: Ganglands—Ilkatar's Territory

Ilkatar's people are abishai and pay at least lip service to Tiamat, in her lair far above. Of all the gangs, they value mortal treasure most, hoarding gold and gems and tithing to their great mother. They're by nature cruel but lazy, easily appeased with gifts or service.

##### Tribute

If tribute is paid, the characters may head north and around the inner district to area M3 or enter the inner district and reach the "Eye Market," bypassing any other gangs. If the characters seek out Ilkatar to pay this tribute, proceed to the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You enter a large, half-finished warehouse turned dwelling, a dimly lit room filled with the sounds of snarling and hissing. Through the lingering smoke you discern a poorly made wooden throne and upon it, a green abishai. To the left of the throne stands a white abishai, clad in gleaming armor and holding a wickedly sharp sword. On either side of the throne, a pair of hell hounds snarl and growl, their fur matted with dried blood, and their teeth gleaming. The green creature speaks, "I am Ilkatar and this is my Brood. Have you come to pay tribute for passage, or to feed my very hungry pets?"
^25d

To pass through this territory the characters need to pay 7,500 gp or deliver a rival's head. If they choose to fight their way through, they're challenged by Ilkatar ([green abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/green-abishai-mpmm.md)), the [white abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/white-abishai-mpmm.md) lieutenant (see Monsters of the Multiverse for the abishai stat blocks), and four [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md).

##### Treasure

If the characters slay Ilkatar and succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, they find a discarded lockbox under the wooden throne. Opening it reveals 3,500 pp.

##### Phylactery of the Spouse/True Love

The character who has ventured into the Nine Hells to rescue their true love finds them imprisoned in one of the buildings in Ilkatar's territory. The soul is tormented in a twisted hall of mirrors. The whole interior of the building is made of mirrored walls, floors, and ceilings.

The soul is trying to find their true reflection among the hundreds of reflections around them. An impossible task, and painful and deadly every time they guess wrong.

To save them, the character needs to find their true love among the many reflections. Have the character make an Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Look up their result on the Mirror Reflections table. Once the character has dealt with the outcome of a failure they can try again.

After finding their true love's reflection, it vanishes leaving the phylactery in its place. The character takes possession of the phylactery of their true love and gains the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

**Mirror Reflections**

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| 3 or less | The reflection vanishes, meanwhile three [white abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/white-abishai-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) step out of nearby mirrors, surrounding the character. If the character gets this result on their fourth or later roll, they find their true love instead. |
| 4–6 | The mirror shatters and the shards cut the character. The character must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 7–9 | The reflection vanishes once the character reaches out for them. If the character gets this result on their fourth or later roll, they find their true love instead. |
| 10–12 | The character is pulled into the reflection by two [black abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/black-abishai-mpmm.md). If the character gets this result on their third roll, they find their true love instead. |
| 13–15 | A [red abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/red-abishai-mpmm.md) lunges forward from the reflection and attacks the character but vanishes at the end of its second turn of combat. If the character gets this result on their second roll, they find their true love instead. |
| 16 or more | They find their true love. |
^mirror-reflections

#### M3: Ganglands—Memnoriac's Territory

Memnoriac was once one of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s architects, a [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) of great status and power. Like all such, his perceived 'failures' eventually led to his downfall, and now he squats with his ragbag of followers in the city he designed and will never complete. The single most powerful devil in the ruin, he is tormented by the collapse of his final project and has become a [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) in miniature. Those under his control are constantly re-edifying the buildings around him, raising them up and tearing them down as he seeks his own minuscule perfection.

##### Tribute

If tribute is paid, the characters may head west and through the inner district to reach the "Eye Market," bypassing any other gangs. If the characters seek out Memnoriac to pay this tribute, proceed to the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You step through open gates beneath the skull of a massive creature. A short walk past the gate, in the center of the courtyard, a muscular creature looms over a table upon which a haphazard model of the city-in-miniature rests. The model itself bears little resemblance to the real city it represents, yet somehow seems even more disorganized. Without even looking up at you, the fiend snarls. "Welcome to Memnoriac's grand city. Have you come to bow and worship, to scrape your knees on the rough gravel, and pay homage to me, the master-builder?"
^262

To pass through this territory, the characters must pay 20,000 gold in gems and coins to fund Memnoriac's construction efforts. Alternatively, they can offer something even more valuable: a compliment. Congratulating Memnoriac on his fabulous city and then succeeding on a DC 22 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check earns the Fiend's goodwill and safe passage. Failing the check, or refusing to pay tribute, results in the pit fiend fighting the characters on his own. He refuses to believe he needs help defeating such puny adversaries. If slain, the Fiend has no treasure, just diagrams of his future building plans.

##### Phylactery of the Great Con

The character looking for their soul can find it among the lowlifes and grifters that inhabit the streets surrounding Memnoriac's skull-gated manor. In other circumstances they would have been right at home here, conning their way to the top of the devil food chain. However, the character's soul isn't in the position to con anyone. It is being tormented by the gang that runs this territory. Memnoriac and his troop of devils have taken up root here after the pit fiends' fall from grace. His obsession with perfecting and completing the city around him, sees him constantly changing the makeup of streets and buildings.

The character searching for this soul hears a voice calling for help from a nearby alley. If the characters investigate, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You see a pit has opened in the alley, almost ten feet in radius and large enough to create a barrier between your side of the alley and the five devils opposite you. They have cornered a trembling and wingless imp, its back to you... and the pit. Its small body trembles in fear and as it takes a step back, it almost falls in.
^264

The character realizes that this imp is the vessel for their soul and that they must rescue it from a [chain devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md), a [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md), and three [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). The devils immediately attack. On each of their turns, one of the devils tries to hit the imp while the others attack the characters. Each time the imp dies it comes back to life on initiative count 20 of the following round but another hostile bearded devil also materializes at the same time. The imp has the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition and is afraid of both the devils and the characters and on its turn, it attempts to flee from both.

To free the imp from its torment, the characters must kill all pursuing devils before anything kills the imp. When this occurs, the imp vanishes, leaving the phylactery in its place.

#### M4: Ganglands—Jacelisk's territory

Jacelisk is a recent addition to the landscape, a tiefling archmage who brought her band of wicked companions to the Market for its particular services. Now, under the influence of recently installed eyes, she sees herself as the liberator and protector of the city she resides in, a great and adored hero. In truth she is as vicious as all the rest, with the added problem that her perceptions make her profoundly unpredictable—sometimes nobility itself and sometimes brutal enough to impress a full-blooded devil.

##### Tribute

Jacelisk has claimed prime gang real estate. If tribute is paid, the characters may head directly north, taking the shortest route to reach the "Eye Market," bypassing any other gangs. If the characters seek out Jacelisk to pay this tribute, proceed to the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A reinforced gateway has been hastily constructed between districts. As you approach the gate a tiefling woman wearing blue robes, emblazoned with numerous tiny, iron, knives, emerges from an azure tent set alongside the gate. Three spike-covered devils follow her, alternating fawning glances in her direction, and hostile gazes your way. The tiefling's eyes seem to be too large for her face and they glow with a strange amber hue as they stare at you. "Welcome, travelers. I am Jacelisk, the Great Liberator, and these are my Knives." She glances at her devil bodyguard, as well as towards many other devilish forms scuttling in the shadows. "Where might you think you are headed?" Somehow, impossibly, her eyes seem to regard each of you at the same time.
^266

Given that her route is the shortest to the Eye Market, and observing that the character's carry many interesting valuables, Jacelisk demands a rare or better magic item and at least four uncommon or better magic items as tribute. If attacked, Jacelisk ([archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) with resistance to fire damage, the ability to cast [Hellish Rebuke](Mechanics/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) twice a day, and the ability to use her Eyes of Charming one time), tries to keep her three [barbed devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md) in between herself and the characters while she unleashes deadly magic. She has already cast [Mage Armor](Mechanics/spells/mage-armor.md) and [Stoneskin](Mechanics/spells/stoneskin.md) on herself. If the characters have attempted to fly past this area, they're intercepted by the barbed devils—Jacelisk has cast the [Fly](Mechanics/spells/fly.md) spell on them.

If slain, the characters may remove Jacelisk's eyes, and if returned to Vaness, these Eyes of Charming can be sold back for half their indicated cost.

#### M5: The Slums

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Just walking the streets of the slum is a struggle. You must watch your step carefully to avoid tripping over heaps of refuse and random construction equipment and to avoid crashing into one of the countless lesser devils that swarm around, calling out in shrieking, whining voices to you and to each other. The air is heavy with a fetid stench and hot from the close press of desperate bodies. The streets are narrow, lined with miserable little attempts at shelter, shacks and sheds of sheets of rusted metal and rotting wood, leaning on each other in a despairing attempt to stay upright.
^268

Closer to the shattered dome of the Eye Market itself is a whole town within a town, a wretched slum of shacks and sheds thrown up with materials salvaged from the abandoned construction works. Here is a morass of pathetic minor devils and travelers who mob any newcomer, desperately trying to sell them all manner of trash—broken weapons, ruined shreds of garments, cracked mirrors, the most meagre of worthless costume jewelry. To the uninitiated the whole desperate circus seems utterly inexplicable. Many will trade junk for equally valueless junk, rubbish passing hands in a constant round of meaningless commerce. Their grotesque parody of trade seems readily exploitable by anyone coming in from the outside, but there is a curious malaise on the streets around the Market. Deal too much with the trash hoarders and you might find yourself getting sucked into their game, desperate to make the next big trade or to acquire some filthy piece of detritus, valuing the junk just because everyone around you does the same.

A remarkable number of the denizens of this slum are damaged, victims of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s construction works where safety is never a concern. Crooked and whining [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) and other lesser devils roost or slither everywhere, proffering fistfuls of slimy muck, desperate to get in on the ground floor of the city's nonsense economy.

##### Conclave (Druid)—Staff of the Woodlands

When the characters walk the slums, they're beset by lowly devils trying to sell them their useless trinkets. If a character is looking for the Staff of the Woodlands their attention is drawn to a miserable looking imp who has set up shop in the corner. When they inspect its wares, they find the staff among them. The imp has no idea of the value of the item it possesses. The character needs to succeed on a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to purchase it for a reasonable price.

Upon success the imp sells the staff for a mere 200 gp or 1 [Soul Coin](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md). It is so happy with the transaction that it throws an amulet of protection in for free. The amulet is a fake and won't protect the character. However, if the character wears the amulet, it leaves a green stain on their skin that can only be removed after 6 days. On a failure, the imp notices the character's eagerness to buy the staff and increase the price to 1,000 gp and 3 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md).

#### M6: The Eye Market

![Vaness inspects his wares.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/159-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Inside the Eye Market is a workshop of peculiar arrangement. There are racks of tools along the back wall, scalpels, knives, and needles intermixed with the equipment of the jeweler's trade. At the front of the Market there is a grand glass case and, within it, small orbs of countless colors, carved from precious stone, are nestled in satin lined boxes. They seem to gleam with inner light.

The proprietors, Vaness and Fling, offer a service unique in all of Maladomini—in all the Nine Hells, in fact. They offer relief from the appalling oppression of the infernal landscape. They offer a glimpse of happiness and wonder, positive things, that benefit Fiends and mortals alike. A bizarre gem to find in such a corrupted setting. Except, of course, nothing in the Nine Hells is as good as it appears.

Vaness is a [beholder](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) of exceptional size, his pinkish hide puffed-up and corpulent. His central eye has been replaced by a lens of ruby quartz that, it is said, focuses magic rather than negating it. In his workshop, using telekinesis and extremely fine-scale disintegration, he crafts the eyes that are the Market's stock in trade. Fling, in contrast, is an [alhoon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/alhoon-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse), a mind flayer long gone on their peculiar path to lichdom. It acts as surgeon, implanting Vaness' creations and connecting them to the brains of its patients/ customers. They make a strange and jarring pair, not least because of their manner. Vaness and Fling strike the unwary as an old married couple, constantly bantering back and forth, making jokes at one another's expense, and exploding into arguments that settle almost instantaneously. It seems impossible that either creature could actually form a real bond, but to all intents and purposes the pair seem genuinely attached. Which often serves to lull visitors into a false sense of security. Vaness and Fling have not survived the Nine Hells for so long by being nice. They're as ruthless and powerful as any other infernal magnates, able to defend themselves physically if need be, but preferring to rely on their minions, treaties with the gangs and, if necessary, protection from Akrekarn and his posse. Moreover, anyone going to deal with them to actually gain new eyes should be very careful what they're agreeing to. Vaness and Fling have a flare for crooked bargaining that some devils could learn from.

##### Hellriders—Rescuing Jenevere

More information about [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) can be found in appendix C. Characters looking for [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md), find the planetar imprisoned in Vaness' workshop. As the characters enter, they notice her caged in the back of the room.

On their travels around the Nine Hells, the characters may have heard the rumors surrounding [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md). It is said she has never been broken, not by any devil. She pains her tormenters by immediately forgiving them for their abuse, praying for those souls that inflict torment on her. She believes no one—not even the vilest of devils—is beyond saving.

The proudest Fiends think they're to be the one to break her, corrupt her. They fight over her. But possessing the planetar becomes tainted once they realize she can't be broken.

And now, imprisoned here in the workshop, [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md)'s magnificent focus is completely on Vaness. She stares intently in Vaness' direction, even though her radiant eyes were taken from her by her cruel captor. It is as if she is looking straight into the beholder's soul.

She doesn't even notice the characters approaching the cage, but as they do, they hear [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) talking. She is lecturing the beholder about forgiveness and urging him to surrender to the grace of the divine light. Vaness has clearly heard it all before and with a frustrated snarl he flings the tool he has been using at the cage. It bounces off [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md)'s head and clatters to the floor. But [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md)'s [concentration](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration) doesn't even falter, as she continues lecturing the put-upon beholder.

This little exchange should inform the characters that Vaness is growing weary of his captive and might be willing to barter with them for her release. A successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces Vaness to let them take [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) with them, if they let the beholder hang on to the planetar's eyes. If the characters insist on taking [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md)'s eyes with them (or if they fail the check) he refuses them.

Once he refuses them, he tells them to leave. At this time the characters can either attack the beholder or leave and try to come back when the workshop is empty. Both scenarios end up in combat as Vaness is never far from his workshop. Any intrusion results in the beholder attacking the characters. After 5 rounds of combat, Fling comes to Vaness' aid, accompanied by two [grell](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/grell.md) and two [grimlocks](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md). After defeating the two proprietors of the workshop the characters can free [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md).

If the victorious characters decide to look for [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md)'s eyes, a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals them floating in a container nearby. Once [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) is freed, the characters may use the ritual that the Hellriders taught them to free her from the Nine Hells.

#### The Jeweled Eyes

In their workshop, assisted by a blind workforce of [grell](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/grell.md) and [grimlocks](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md) enslaved by Fling's mental powers, Vaness and Fling remove the natural eyes of their clients and replace them with the jeweled creations from Vaness' workshop, granting a whole new perspective on Maladomini. A simple thing, in a way, and yet priceless. Vaness' eyes allow his patients to see the layer the way it was meant to be. When a newly altered customer wakes from the surgery, the dome above them is complete, its ceiling ornate and painted with frescoes of surpassing loveliness. Vaness and Fling are elegant and dignified, the master-surgeon and the genial artificer, surrounded by their immaculate staff. Outside, the spires of the city reach towards a glorious golden sky, and beyond that there are great verdant forests, jeweled castles that would melt the heart of a Fey queen, a world of glory and wonder such as the Nine Hells have never known.

The true power of the eyes is that these things aren't illusions, to those who can see them. Those towers can be scaled, the woods bear fruit that truly sates hunger. Instead of the poisonous sludge of Maladomini, the streams now run with sparkling claret liquid that tastes like the finest of wines and brings instant relief and freshness to the drinker. To live in the plane visible through Vaness' eyes is to be truly blessed.

The Eyes for Sale table lists the different types of eyes that can be purchased. These eyes do not require the wearer to attune to them, even if they normally would. In addition to the abilities mentioned, each set of eyes also makes the wearer no longer require food or water (because it is always abundant for them), and the weather affecting them is always pleasant (never too hot or too cold; they're immune to nonmagical fire or cold damage). Finally, no terrain is ever considered difficult for them. These effects persist even after the wearer leaves Maladomini.

#### The Truth Is Ugly

Of course, there are drawbacks. The ancient and wondrous beasts that once roamed the forests of Maladomini are long extinct, but they're most certainly there to those with eyes to see. And this being the Nine Hells, they're frequently hostile. Many eye-bearers have been killed and devoured by glorious and majestic monsters that their companions can't even see, let alone fight. Moreover, everyone who leaves the Eye Market having conducted business with Vaness and Fling becomes a target. All those waiting outside would give a great deal more than their eyes to get hold of such things, even though the services of Fling would still be required to implant them. Overcome with wonder, many new patients are easy marks for muggers and back-street surgeons.

The chief question about all of this must be why [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) puts up with any of it. Vaness, Fling, and Akrekarn maintain a careful charade where the two put-upon artisans are constantly under threat from the devil, about to be turned in to the layer's archdevil unless they can come up with the latest bribe or protection instalment. And yet it never quite happens, and somehow the peculiar pair are permitted to run their business, which seems to make a mockery of everything that [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) is constantly, futilely trying to achieve in his domain.

The most persuasive reason is that the eyes, for all their vaunted promise, are a curse. The wearer is at first overwhelmed by the beauty they see, delighted to walk in a 'Hell' that is suddenly restorative and pleasant. Except the truth always creeps in. Those who wear the eyes can stave off reality only so far. In their dreams they see the truth of it, the ruin and the ugliness. Day by day the understanding grows that everything they see, that they could now never live without, is only a sham, however real it is to them. The knowledge torments them, and they're driven to their own hopeless attempts to achieve a lasting perfection. In this way they share in [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s private misery, and perhaps that is enough reason to keep Vaness and Fling around.

A seditious whisper suggests that there is another reason. That [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), lord of temptation, feels the hook of their services in him. The idea that he could see Maladomini as he wishes it to be, the great blueprint he constantly fails to build, eats him up constantly. So that he is constantly on the point of ordering Akrekarn to obliterate the Market, but never quite gives the order, because what if...

Whenever a roll on any encounter table is called for, a character possessing eyes from the Eye Market must also roll on the following encounter table. If multiple characters possess these cursed eyes, they all share the same result. If any of these encounters result in combat, only the characters with cursed eyes can see their attackers or target them, and only they are harmed by the abilities of their attackers. Other characters may only provide support, such as healing, to the afflicted characters. Any characters that die outright, or are reduced to zero hit points, in these battles, immediately have their eyes removed and the attackers disappear.
