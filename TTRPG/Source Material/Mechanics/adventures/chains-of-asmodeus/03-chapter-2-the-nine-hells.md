# Chapter 2: The Nine Hells
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 43* 

![The desolate terrain of Av...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/042-0.webp#center "The desolate terrain of Avernus serves as a backdrop for the Eternal War.")

The characters start their journey at the Bronze Citadel. From there they can travel down the River Styx on [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge. It is important to read through both the introduction and this chapter before running sessions that take place in the Nine Hells.

## Character Objectives

Each layer of the Nine Hells has an adventure location that may contain one of the souls that the characters are searching for. In addition, there is the group patron's objective. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is familiar with each layer along with the adventure locations of each. However, he won't speak about a layer or its adventure location until they arrive. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) responds to any questions on upcoming layers by saying, "All in due time." The characters might wish to explore an adventure location even if it doesn't contain one of their objectives. You should allow them to do this as they can still stumble across the objectives of other group patrons.

The Objective Locations table summarizes where to find the souls the characters seek as well as their group patron's objectives (appendix D contains further details about the items the Deathstalkers seek.)

## River Styx Encounters

Each day that the characters travel down the Styx there is a 50 percent chance that they might encounter something along its shores. If they do happen to encounter something, roll a `d6` and add a number equal to the layer of the Nine Hells they're on. For example, if they're on Phlegethos, the fourth layer, then you roll `1d6 + 4`. Refer to the River Styx Encounters in the Nine Hells table to determine the encounter that the characters come across.

### Ride of the Demon Lord

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sprawling makeshift camp sits atop a low plateau. At the center of the camp is a massive tent stitched from the hides of a variety of devils. Above it, demons fly about calling to each other in their awful speech. Dozens more scream and gibber at each other from barges that float in the River Styx ahead of you. Three such barges have already begun rowing your way but a large, winged demon lands on your ship well before they can reach you.
^088

The camp on the plateau is the war compound of the demon lord [Baphomet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baphomet-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse). He has penetrated deeply into the Nine Hells and intends to throw his host of demons at one of the devils' great flying strongholds to slaughter as many of his enemies as possible. The demons know they will die in the attack, but since they're not native to the Nine Hells it is of no consequence. Their bodies will simply reform in the Abyss. The devils that they kill will die forever.

The demon that lands on [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s ship is a nalfeshnee in command of the demon host's barges. It demands that the characters accompany it to speak with its lord, Baphomet, who is currently within the camp on the plateau. If the characters refuse, the demon attacks and the [nalfeshnee](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nalfeshnee.md) is assisted by three fly-like [chasmes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chasme.md). If these demons are defeated, the characters can bypass the interdiction and proceed down the River Styx, skipping the remainder of this encounter.

On the other hand, if the characters agree to meet Baphomet, they're escorted to shore and from there, brought into the camp. Baphomet has also recruited several mortals to his cause. The humans will likely end up as lemures when killed, so their participation is particularly unfathomable. Before meeting the demon lord, the characters may speak with some of the humans in the camp:

- A pair of warriors have come to the Nine Hells on a mission like that of the characters. They're monks from the far-off land of Shou Lung and the souls of their mother and father were taken by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).  
- A half-dozen soldiers calling themselves Knights of Solamnia have come from a world called Krynn. They call Tiamat by a different name—Takhisis. They're just trying to survive and have joined Baphomet because he is an enemy of Tiamat.  
- Three Red Wizards from the land of Thay. They tried to summon and control Baphomet and failed. Now they must help in his war against the devils of the Nine Hells.  

Once inside the compound the characters are brought to see Baphomet who resides within the huge devil-skin tent, the inner supports of which appear to be the bones of a mighty beast.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The commander of this demon army is a great, twentyfoot-tall, black-furred minotaur with six iron horns. At either side of him stand minotaur-like demons who are just as massive as their lord. At the back of the tent sits a bone cage within which over a dozen humans huddle in terror.
^089

Unless the characters are openly hostile, Baphomet, and the two [goristro](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md) with him, won't attack. His enemies are the devils of the Nine Hells, not the characters. He would rather share his plan. He tells the characters that it is time to throw down the chains of oppression that law and civilization bring. He wants them to help him destroy one of the flying citadels that archdevils often use to fly above the hellscape of their home. Baphomet offhandedly explains that if the characters turn down his offer, they'll join the meat that waits to be consumed after victory is achieved and points to the prisoners in the bone cage. But he insists it is their choice.

Baphomet desires to draw the citadel to this location whereupon he plans to trigger an overly complicated assault, the details of which the characters don't need to know. He simply needs them to locate the nearest citadel and attract its attention, so it diverts towards the camp. As a reward, Baphomet offers a chest full of 5,000 gp once the characters return with a citadel on its way. If the characters negotiate for the human prisoners' freedom, Baphomet agrees to free all of them, though withdraws the offer of the chest. To win both the prisoners' freedom and the gold the characters must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

Baphomet points across the land, away from the River Styx, and suggests they begin their search in that direction. At this point the characters are free to leave, easily able to double around and return to [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge and certain escape, though that would leave the captive humans at the mercy of the demons. If they've any interest in saving those unfortunates, the characters need to locate the citadel for Baphomet.

![Baphomet stares down an infernal citadel.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/047-0.webp#center)

#### Finding the Citadel

Baphomet assembled his camp at this location, knowing it was near a devil patrol route, so locating a citadel won't be difficult. After `1d4` hours the characters see a citadel on the horizon. Any activity out of the ordinary attracts the attention of the citadel's crew (a spell or other visually impressive distraction suffices). Once it begins moving towards them it is easy for the characters to keep ahead of the citadel and reach the camp and Baphomet's tent before it arrives. Baphomet is ecstatic at their success, though distracted at the impending battle. He gestures to their reward and then exits his tent. Through the open flap, the characters watch the citadel's arrival.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The gigantic basalt citadel, shaped like a sword's blade, emerges from the clouds above the River Styx. Screaming demons madly scurry onto the bone platforms laying around the fort. Chasmes add to the cacophony as groups of those fly-like demons grasp the platforms, dragging each into the sky.
^08b

There are several choices the characters can make at this point but attacking the citadel is a doomed endeavor and the party should be encouraged to avoid joining the demons.

#### Escape and Rescue

As Baphomet departs the characters should try and make an escape with their reward. If they didn't win the captives' freedom earlier, they must now defeat one [goristro](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md) guard to free the captives. The remainder of the demonic host doesn't notice these hostilities, busy as they are with the assault. Once on the barge, the characters witness the assault's failure from a distance.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge drifts down the River Styx, you watch the ill-fated attack on the flying citadel fail as the great swarms of chasmes are torn asunder by various winged devils, their precarious platforms tumbling, each collapse sending dozens of demons and their human allies to their deaths. Silhouetted against the skyline stands Baphomet, the great demon merely shrugging at the failure before walking back towards his camp.
^08d

#### Attacking the Citadel

If the characters want to join in the assault on the citadel, it is clear that the demons shall lose this battle. It should also be clear that the characters can simply leave the battle at any time—neither demon nor devil notice. The devilish host includes ten [shredwings](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/shredwing-coa.md) fighting the chasmes and eight [affliction devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/affliction-devil-kocrachon-coa.md) guarding each citadel entrance (see appendix B for both). Inside a squad of sixteen [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md) emerge to further challenge intruders. If somehow despite all these obstacles the characters reach the bridge, they find it crewed by six [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md), two [war devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md) (see appendix B), and the archdevil appropriate to this layer of the Nine Hells.

### Shadow of a Tyrant

![A tyrant shadow takes on t...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/048-0.webp#center "A tyrant shadow takes on the form of a giant spider.")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Swarms of thousands of bloated flies fill the air with a droning sound. These flies feed on the manure from the herd of rothé that stand dumbly about upon the shore. Jagged rocks and deep pits can be seen a little further inland. Most of the pits vanish into inky darkness, though something metallic glitters within one of the shadowed maws.
^090

This region of the Nine Hells is infested with [ayperobos](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ayperobo-swarm-coa.md) (see appendix B). These tiny devils swarm about by the thousands, disguising themselves within the swarms of black flies. They've even burrowed into the flesh of several of the [rothé](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rothe-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) and now control these beasts like puppets. The devious devils have scattered the armor, weapons, and treasure of previous victims near the entrance of one of the caves. This way, it can easily be seen from boats passing by. However, it isn't the ayperobos that poses the greatest danger here.

The first clue to the dangers of this area are the freshly stripped corpses of several rothé, recently eaten by the ayperobos. All that remains of these rothé are their intact skeletons, flecked with blood and flesh. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check reveals that these corpses are recent and that whatever killed them stripped all of the meat from their bones in a matter of moments.

The ayperobos wait until their prey has come ashore before attacking—unless it looks like a passing ship doesn't intend to stop. They will then descend upon their victims en masse. A swarm of them will push against the mast, sails and even hull of the Styx barge to drive it against the shore. A successful DC 15 Strength check is required by the navigator to keep a boat on course. The ayperobos aren't interested in eating the flesh of their victims; instead, they serve a greater threat. A [tyrant shadow](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/tyrant-shadow-coa.md) (see appendix B) lives within the caves that dot the shore and the ayperobos lure in hapless mortals and devils to be consumed by it. If any of the ayperobos swarms take control of a creature, they force it to enter the nearest cave mouth.

The tyrant shadow is a thing of concentrated hatred, fear, and loathing. It has taken the appearance of a [giant spider](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) made from writhing shadows. As soon as it has an opportunity it snatches a single victim and drags him or her deep into its cave system. From there the tyrant shadow takes its time to devour its prey, hoping that the screams attract a rescue attempt.

This particular tyrant shadow was manifested by the archdevil known as [Zagum](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zagum-coa.md) of the Triad. Treasure. Among the scattered belongings are some valuables. Select three uncommon magic items from the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

### Horsemen of the Apocalypse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Before you, four towering beasts loom, resembling massive dinosaurs covered in heavy armor plating. Seated atop each creature is a devil, their eyes burning with malevolent intelligence.
^092

These are the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, fallen rulers who climbed the ranks of the Nine Hells and now serve as harbingers of the end times. While they await their chance to unleash destruction upon their former worlds, they spend their time bickering among themselves, each vying for dominance over the others. Each rider is astride a formidable steed.

The horsemen won't immediately attack but instead try to engage the characters in their endless bickering, each trying to prove their own superiority over the others. Like it or not, they'll force the characters to choose which of their philosophies is best. Whoever they choose is overjoyed and leaves the fate of the characters in the hands of his or her companions. The remaining three horsemen unleash their full fury, using all their powers and abilities to destroy the characters.

![The four horsemen ride across the Nine Hells.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/049-0.webp#center)

#### King Molvar of the Rhokor

This horned devil rides an ankylosaurus. He formerly governed the kingdom of Keoland on Oerth, disseminating false information regarding the elimination of the so-called "detrimental elements of the society."

#### Overlord Zelthor

This [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) rides a [shredwing](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/shredwing-coa.md) and was once an emperor of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy on Oerth. He speaks in the third person and believes in the power of the individual over the collective.

#### Overqueen Yarlis

An [erinyes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) who rides a [triceratops](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/triceratops.md), Yarlis was a queen of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy on Oerth. She's notorious for taking credit for other people's quotes, much to the annoyance of King Molvar and Overlord Zelthor. She believes in the power of the individual to change the world.

#### Yamun Khazad

This [pain devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pain-devil-excruciarch-coa.md) rides an intimidating [miasmorne](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/miasmorne-coa.md) (see appendix B for both) and comes from the world of Faerûn, where he was once a warlord that united the tribes of the Endless Steppe. He believes in the power of victory and domination over others.

### Gatekeeper's Quiz

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The timbers of your ship groan as it suddenly lurches to a stop. It seems to have run aground in the middle of the Styx.
^098

A powerful [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse), named Minos, controls this section of the River Styx. He is in command of a [Styx dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/styx-dragon-coa.md) (see appendix B) that he uses to stop ships passing through. Minos considers himself an arbiter and judge of the Nine Hells. He enjoys judging the souls of the damned. Though boats frequently pass him by, they're rarely crewed with mortals, and thus his interest is piqued. Minos' other talent is with riddles, something he loves to practice with devils and mortals alike.

Minos rises from the Styx once the ship has been brought to a stop by his Styx dragon. He asks for the names of the crew members. If any on board shares their name, Minos acts as if he has heard the name before and plays upon the pride of the individual. He tries to convince one of the characters to play a game of riddles with him. If they refuse, then he explains that their ship is in the grip of his Styx dragon and that he will only allow them passage if they play his game.

The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Minos will pose a riddle and then the character must pose a riddle. Feel free to replace the three riddles below with different ones of your choosing. The players can either come up with a riddle on their own (which you try to answer) or they can succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence check to craft a riddle Minos can't solve. The characters are victorious if Minos can't answer one of their riddles or if they're able to answer all three of the riddles posed by Minos.

- I create nothing from everything. I provide passage where there is none. I travel the layers peddling my wares, but no payment is required. What am I?  
-     - **Answer.** River Styx    
- I am something of ultimate value, yet weightless. I am a ledger of deeds, yet nothing is written. I can visit other planes, yet the corporeal remains. What am I?  
-     - **Answer.** Soul    
- In consuming everything, it gives life. Its remains bring about rebirth. To embrace it is to die, yet it readily travels with almost any group. What is it?  
-     - **Answer.** Fire    
- Every creature follows their own version, whether written or thought. Without it, there would be no Blood War. Its interpretation and presence has driven conflict since the beginning of time. What is it?  
-     - **Answer.** Law    
- I'm never far from my sibling, fire, Find comfort in me, liars, For when I make something unfound, Use touch, taste, smell, or sound.  
-     - **Answer.** Darkness    
- To have me is to have everything, To be as powerful as a king, Yet, my endless pursuit brings only emptiness, Having everything brings joy less and less.  
-     - **Answer.** Wealth    

Winning the game of riddles results in Minos allowing the characters to choose one infernal magic item from his stash at the bottom of the Styx. He has the following items: [Bracers of Asmodeus](Mechanics/items/bracers-of-asmodeus-coa.md), [Canian Fork](Mechanics/items/canian-fork-coa.md), [Demonbone Polearm](Mechanics/items/demonbone-polearm-coa.md), [Infernal Amulet](Mechanics/items/infernal-amulet-coa.md), [Infernal Plate Armor](Mechanics/items/infernal-plate-armor-coa.md), [Stygian Spear](Mechanics/items/stygian-spear-coa.md), and the [Sword of Retribution](Mechanics/items/sword-of-retribution-coa.md) (these are described in appendix D).

Losing the game of riddles results in Minos demanding 5 Soul Coins to continue down the river. Refusal results in Minos and the Styx dragon attacking. If Minos is attacked or if the game of riddles is refused, then the amnizu and his pet Styx dragon will attack together.

### Camp of Hedonism

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large, fortified camp has been built on the shore of the River Styx from huge bones and bleached timber. No one patrols its walls, but the sounds of laughter and joy can be heard from within.
^09a

This camp is the home of Gulgara, a powerful [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B) known as a sire of corruption, and her many minions. Gulgara created the camp decades ago as a trap for the unwary and a place to hone her powers of corruption. Recently a large group of adventurers were searching for the souls of their loved ones when they came under attack by numerous devils. The adventurers could not believe their luck when they saw what appeared to be an abandoned infernal fort. They took refuge within, not realizing it was the corruption devil's powers that had drawn them there in the first place.

> [!note] Decadent Corruption
> 
> The most powerful of corruption devils, the sire of corruption, gains a powerful aura that pervades and weakens the will of anyone within 300 feet of the devil. When a creature first enters the aura, they must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save the creature falls under a curse known as decadent corruption.
> 
> While cursed in this way, the character has disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks. In addition, a character that has the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition while cursed in this way, remembers nothing of what happened to them while [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed), once the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition ends. Finally, a cursed character becomes reckless, automatically failing any Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks they may make. Often this manifests as a dangerous sort of curiosity, which may result in a desire to investigate the camp.
> 
> A [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell, a [Remove Curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, or other magic that removes curses, can remove the corruption curse and end all its effects. Those that succeed the saving throw or have been cured are immune to the effects of decadent corruption until they finish a long rest. Leaving the corruption aura also ends the curse on the affected creature but does not grant immunity to the curse. A corrupted character won't voluntarily leave the area and if asked to do so, the character makes excuses for why it can't.
^decadent-corruption

The adventurers (four [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), three [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md), two [druids](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md), two [spies](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md), and a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) are oblivious to the many torments they've suffered. A dozen succubi, in the guise of friendly elves, work in the camp, enacting Gulgara's various torments.

Characters approaching the gates to the camp are welcomed by a pair of succubi, claiming to be adventurers. They invite the characters to partake in the festivities within the camp. They open the gates to reveal the grounds of the fort, which are occupied by numerous adventurers. There are also two large tents in the distance.

A succubus points out the activities that the characters might want to participate in:

- A half dozen adventurers are greedily eating from a vast table filled with delicacies from across the multiverse.  
- A pair of knights are sitting on cushioned seats in front of vast mirrors as their armor is shined by imps. There are several empty seats, and more [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) waiting to work.  
- A priest and a couple of spies are engaged in a rowdy game of dice.  

Each tent is guarded by a pair of [succubi](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md) that have taken the appearance of human knights and pretend to be adventurers. They allow entry only to those obviously under the influence of Gulgara's decadent corruption ability. If the characters attempt to force their way into a tent, all the camp's occupants attack the characters.

In the first tent, a mage is being tortured by a trio of [affliction devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/affliction-devil-kocrachon-coa.md) (see appendix B). The devils attack characters not under the influence of the decadent corruption ability. The other tent is where Gulgara can be found. She attacks characters not under the influence of the decadent corruption ability but emerges from the tent only if a fight breaks out between the characters and her servants.

The entire camp is under the influence of Gulgara's decadent corruption ability. The adventurers can be saved but each requires their decadent corruption be removed, as described in the sidebar. If a devil or succubus sees that an adventurer has been saved in this way, or any adventurer attempts to leave the camp, the remainder of the camp goes hostile. Adventurers that have been saved fight to assist the characters and, if they survive, continue to travel the Nine Hells with the characters.

^09e

This ragtag group of twelve [centaurs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) are dedicated to a good, but misguided, cause. After some discussion, the characters will learn that these centaurs are attempting to alleviate the suffering of some of the souls in the Nine Hells. In particular, they help individuals they deem non-deserving of their suffering. These [larvae](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/larva-dmg.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for this stat block), [lemures](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md) and [nupperibos](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nupperibo-mpmm.md) are in bone caged carts that some of the centaur band are yoked to. They willingly entered the Nine Hells decades ago at the behest of their chieftain. They originally numbered in the hundreds but have been reduced to just a dozen.

What they don't realize is that their quest is a trick. Their chieftain signed away their souls so that he could be granted great power. He convinced his greatest warriors that they needed to enter the Nine Hells and save the innocent souls that had been unfairly consigned to suffer there. He told them how to recognize such souls, but these were just lies. The signs he told them to look for include:

- Joyful facial expressions  
- Issuing curses against the gods  

If the characters are able to ascertain that the centaur's quest is a lie (through magic spells such as [Divination](Mechanics/spells/divination.md) or [Contact Other Plane](Mechanics/spells/contact-other-plane.md)), then they can try to convince the band of their findings. This requires a successful DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

If the characters are successful at convincing the centaurs of the fact that their quest is a lie, one of the nupperibos begins to giggle, then laugh, then cackle uncontrollably. After his death, the chieftain was consigned to the Nine Hells, as a nupperibo. The centaurs stumbled upon him a few years ago, without even realizing his identity, and he has been with them ever since.

### Bowl of Suffering

![Larvae try to escape the Bowl of Suffering.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/053-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Piteous screams can be heard from the shoreline. A huge bowl formed from smooth obsidian is surrounded by a half dozen devils that push back creatures trying to escape from it. Enormous elephant like devils stand impassively as guards.
^0a0

There are six [pain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pain-devil-excruciarch-coa.md) and two [maelephant nomads](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md) (for both, see appendix B) around the bowl. Only someone standing at the edge of the bowl can see that it is filled with [larvae](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/larva-dmg.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for this stat block), [lemures](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md), [nupperibos](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nupperibo-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse), and a few [dretches](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/dretch.md) captured during the Blood War. These dretches have honed their telepathy so that they can communicate in any language. The pain devils push down any of the pitiful creatures that manage to climb up the sides of the bowl.

The maelephants attack anyone who tries to interfere with the pain devils.

The dretches use their telepathy to make promises to any mortal they see, but all their promises are lies. One dretch claims to be an angelic creature trapped under the other infernal creatures. Another dretch claims that there is a suit of magic plate armor at the bottom. Anyone crawling into the bowl is swarmed by the piteous creatures and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. They take 21 (`6d6`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Magic within the bowl is corrupted so that any spell cast within it fails and triggers a wild magic surge. Determine the surge's effect by rolling on the sorcerer's [Wild Magic Surge](Mechanics/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "Player's Handbook".

### Forest of Pain

![Hellcats prowl the forest.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/054-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A forest grows on both sides of the River Styx. The trees are twisted and without any leaves. Among the trees lumber huge sloth like creatures.
^0a2

This forest is the home of one of Hell's larger herds of [oneirovores](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/oneirovore-coa.md) (see appendix B). These creatures, also known as dream eaters, are grazing on the branches of the trees. When they break off a branch it bleeds a luminescent sap that the oneirovores eagerly lap up. This sap is made up of the dreams of mortals.

Attacking the herd can quickly turn into a disaster. If any of the oneirovores is hurt, `2d4` [hellcats](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md) (see appendix B) immediately spring to their defense. An oneirovore that is injured cries mournfully and releases its stored phantasmagoria. Nearby oneirovores also release their phantasmagoria. Things quickly get worse when the herd's shepherd arrives. In `1d4` rounds a pack of a dozen [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md) will burst on to the scene. A round later the shepherd, a [war devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md) (see appendix B), arrives.

If the guardians of the flock are dealt with, then it isn't too difficult to coax some of the oneirovores on to a boat. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check convinces an oneirovore to follow along. However, it is very dangerous for anyone to rest while so close to a dream eater. Someone who finishes a long rest within 10 feet of an oneirovore must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The DC increases by 5 for each oneirovore beyond the first. A failed save results in disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. Only a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell can remove this effect.

### Canyons of Greed

![Nothing is left of the pro...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/055-0.webp#center "Nothing is left of the prospectors, except their greed.")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The River Styx cuts its way through a canyon larger than any in the mortal world. A sound like thunder can be heard from above as rocks begin to tumble down the canyon's sides towards your barge.
^0a4

Four [maelephant nomads](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md) (see appendix B) stand at the top of the canyon and push boulders toward any ship passing by. These boulders glisten with embedded gold nuggets and when they smash into their target or hit the side of the canyon they break apart, scattering `2d12` gold nuggets along the riverbank. Each throws three boulders (Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (`4d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage) before retiring out of sight. A spell such as [Gust of Wind](Mechanics/spells/gust-of-wind.md) pushes a ship out of range immediately.

Nearly a dozen prospectors emerge from caves in the sides of the canyon and huts built along the shore. They scramble to collect the gold nuggets, often wading into the river to pick up nuggets that land in the shallows. The memories of these prospectors have long ago been eroded. Now all they care about is finding gold nuggets in the river and hiding whatever they find in the small lair they've built for themselves. Each gold nugget is worth 100 gp, but the prospectors react violently to anyone who tries to take their gold. The prospectors have silently agreed to not touch the treasure hoard of another. Anyone doing so earns the wrath of all the prospectors. A variety of prospectors live here:

- 3 [fire giants](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md)  
- 1 dwarf [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)  
- 1 orc [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)  
- 1 elf [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)  
- 1 [young red dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md)  
- 2 [fomorians](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md)  

Each prospector has `1d100` gold nuggets in their lair.

### Ruin and Amusement

![Baalzebul's amusement park...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/056-0.webp#center "Baalzebul's amusement park isn't for the faint of heart.")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The River Styx flows through a stone canal that cuts through the heart of an infernal city. The sounds of laughter and joy can be heard from what looks to be an amusement park!
^0a6

The River Styx flows into a stone canal that has been built through the heart of one of Hell's many abandoned cities. The city is long dead, except for an amusement park at the city center.

This amusement park is another one of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s bizarre creations and is one of the few places in the Nine Hells where the non-infernal outnumber devils. Travelers from across the planes travel down the Styx to experience the famed rides.

> [!note] Location
> 
> If this encounter takes place in Malbolge or Cania, then it should do so on the borders of Maladomini.
^location

At the main entry, a [succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md) and an [incubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) hand out entrance tickets for 10 gp each. However, anyone sneaking in without paying doesn't need to fear reprisal. Once inside, visitors are free to try out any of the fun rides. Once they've tried out one or two, they are approached by a succubus or incubus who tries to persuade them to try out one of the devilish rides.

#### Fun Rides

These are rides that, while frightening, aren't dangerous.

##### Ferris Wheel

This huge wheel allows up to six Medium-sized creatures in each of its cages. Cleverly placed illusions create elaborate scenes, simulating a journey through the Nine Hells. A rider looking out from their cage begins their journey with a majestic view of Avernus and travels in a slow circle through each layer in turn, with the ride ending with a view of the deep canyons of Nessus. In total the ride takes no more than ten minutes but feels much longer than that.

##### Infernal Mansion

This mansion is filled with some of the most gruesome looking demons and devils. The devils are willingly scaring participants, while the demons are... not so willing. A [chain devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md) uses chains to disturb those who walk down an inky black corridor. A pair of [hellcats](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md) (see appendix B) terrorize people walking through an ancient torture chamber and a [displacer fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/displacer-fiend-coa.md) (see appendix B) reaches out with its tentacles from a cage just unable to reach participants. Finally, there are the exploding [manes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/manes.md) demons. They're released from multiple tiny doors and run gibbering at participants before exploding right before they reach them. This means that participants are always covered in demonic ichor. Luckily, this ichor doesn't behave as it does in the rest of the lower planes, but participants aren't told that.

##### Roller Coaster

The second most terrifying roller coaster in the multiverse. The twists, turns, spirals and upside-down tracks dissuade many from trying it out. Anyone riding it must succeed on a half dozen DC 15 Wisdom saving throws to stop from screaming during the ride.

#### Devilish Rides

Each ride costs 250 gp per rider and can be extremely dangerous. However, winning contestants earn powerful magical treasure. Winners of a ride earn a magic item from the "Dungeon Master's Guide". Winners can win only one prize. Any character under 10th level receives an uncommon magic item. Characters 10th level to 15th level receive a rare magic item (excluding weapons) and characters 16th level or higher receive a very rare magic item (excluding weapons).

##### Carousel

This carousel starts off spinning slowly, but quickly gains speed. Contestants must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to hold on during the first minute. Every subsequent minute the DC increases by 5 to a maximum of 30. The ride ends when there is only a single rider left or once the DC reaches 30. A rider who fails their check flies out and hits the barrier walls, taking 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every point of DC—to a maximum of 70 (`20d6`). The barrier needs to be cleaned of gore at the end of every night.

##### Doom Coaster

This is the deadliest and most terrifying roller coaster in the multiverse and carries riders through a series of dangerous features. With each terrifying event, a rider must survive not only the physical danger, but they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for the remainder of the ride. While [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in this way, a rider also has disadvantage on all saving throws.

The roller coaster begins by ascending a vast stretch of rickety track until it reaches 600 feet. It then travels through the features, visiting each once. After the final feature the roller coaster returns to the relative safety of ground level again. The features are presented in the order that riders encounter them:

- **Lady of Pain.** The roller coaster does a circle around an enormous head with huge blades sticking out of it. Each rider must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (`10d6`) slashing damage.  
- **Maw of the Dragon.** The roller coaster drops into the fiery maw of an artificial dragon and each rider must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (`8d6`) fire damage.  
- **Stygian Glaciers.** The roller coaster turns upside down so that its riders are immersed in a lake of frigid water filled with razor sharp icy shards, before the roller coaster ascends again. Each rider must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 17 (`5d6`) cold damage and 7 (`2d6`) slashing damage.  
- **Storm King's Thunder.** The roller coaster drops into the arms of a 100-foot-tall storm giant automaton. As the giant places the coaster on the new set of tracks, everything is electrified, and each rider must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (`10d6`) lightning damage.  
- **Great Green Devil.** The roller coaster rushes through the open mouth of a huge green devil face and each rider must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 42 (`12d6`) necrotic damage. Any rider reduced to 0 hit points is disintegrated.  

##### Bumper Cars

A variety of infernal war machines compete here in a massive arena. The drivers of the machines must destroy the other machines by smashing into them. Riders may select either a Large machine or a Huge machine (each machine can only have one occupant). These vehicles have fierce names, such as "Devil's Ride," "Tormentor," and "Scavenger". The character's goal is for their machine to survive 5 rounds—each rider that manages this feat, wins. Surviving each round requires a character to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid a collision with another machine. The DC if the character is piloting a Large machine is 15 but becomes 20 for those piloting a Huge vehicle. If the character fails the saving throw, their vehicle is destroyed if it is Large. A Huge machine can survive one impact, but a second impact destroys it. When a machine is destroyed, the rider takes 17 (`5d6`) bludgeoning damage. If a vehicle-less character starts their turn in the arena, they must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 35 (`10d6`) bludgeoning damage as they're run down by an infernal machine.

### Angelic Villa

A small group of angels live in a once beautiful palace, overgrown with the filth of the Nine Hells. Flies and wasps surround the palace, and worms writhe in the mud around it. These angels were companions of Triel, the fallen angel that became the archdevil [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md). They aren't evil, but they're no longer good either. They haven't committed to either the hierarchy of the Nine Hells or returned to their original home in the Seven Heavens. Their moral relativity has made them into sad figures with no purpose or hope.

The angel Samael flies above the Styx and attempts to contact any good characters it notices below. The angel uses telepathy to provide directions to a nearby palace where characters may rest and recover.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A palace is half-sunk in the mud and a great swarm of flies and wasps hovers over it like a nightmarish cloud. You look up at the façade of the building and see the remnants of beauty long gone. Intricate carvings in marble are covered in filth and crawling things. Mighty stone walls lie half crumbled away, revealing the rotting wood supports jutting out like shattered bones. There were tall windows once. Now there remain only gaping holes. Slits of impenetrable black, glaring down at you like soulless eyes.
^0b1

When the characters enter the palace, they find angels within. There are several devas led by a planetar named Uriel. These angels have lived together in this region of the Nine Hells for millennia. There were once dozens of them, but over time their number has been reduced as some have died in battle, others have fallen to complete corruption, and a few have redeemed themselves and returned to the Seven Heavens. Those that remain are:

- **Uriel.** He was a patron of the arts.  
- **Arariel.** He controlled the waters of the earth.  
- **Chamuel.** They represented serenity and devotion.  
- **Gadreel.** He was known as the watcher.  
- **Muriel.** She was a patron of travelers.  
- **Phanuel.** She offered hope and repentance.  
- **Samael.** He fetched the souls of the dead.  

Uriel wants the characters to join them for dinner. He wishes to hear tales of the characters' exploits. In return, he allows the characters to partake from his wine cellar, one of the most comprehensive in the multiverse.

If the characters turn him down, he is disappointed, but lets them know that they can return at any time to take him up on his offer. Any act of aggression by the characters results in the angels attacking with a level of coordination that befits a group that has been together for millennia.

![Uriel holds court over fallen angels.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/058-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The angel called Chamuel has brought a rose to dinner. They twirl the long-stemmed flower between their fingers and smile whenever they catch you looking. Something so delicate seems terribly out of place amidst the rot and horror of the Nine Hells and as Chamuel lifts the rose to brush against their lips, you notice how soft and red its petals are. To the angel Chamuel's left, at the head of the table, sits Uriel, your host, and on the other side of him is the angel called Phanuel. She sits stiffly in her chair and though her face is still and placid, her piercing eyes are full of storms. Uriel makes a gesture and the other angels file in, bringing with them plates of food and pitchers of drink. When everything has been laid out, they take their own seats. Uriel makes another gesture and the tall candles that line the long table all light up. "Well, then," Uriel says with a smile. "Shall we begin?"
^0b2

The dinner is fraught with potential danger. During each of the three courses, an angel asks a challenging question which requires a successful ability check to answer. Failing a check results in that angel challenging that character to a duel. If the character refuses the duel, then Uriel expels the character from the estate. If the character undertakes the duel and the angel reduces the character to 0 hit points, the angel chooses to incapacitate the character instead of landing a killing blow. If the character doesn't do the same if they win, then Uriel expels all of the characters from the estate.

In the first course, Chamuel selects the character with the highest Charisma score and questions their serenity or devotion. The character must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to avoid the duel. In the second course, Samael demands that the frailest character (the one with the lowest Constitution score) justifies how they've survived so far. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, made with disadvantage if the character is injured. In the final course, Phanuel, who has become exhausted from sustaining all her companions, now asks a character to step forward to convince her that hope still remains for these abandoned angels of the Nine Hells. That character must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

If the characters are not expelled, when they prepare to leave, Uriel allows each into his wine cellar. Some bottles of wine have magical properties that might be useful on their journeys. Each character can make an Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to select a good vintage. Any result above 15 allows them to roll once on the Magical Wines table. Above 20 and they roll twice, allowing them to select which of the two bottles they prefer to take.

### A Paladin in Hell

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A narrow path climbs the cliff wall beside the River Styx. On the path an armored warrior battles dozens of devils. His sword and armor are coated in the black blood of his enemies. He calls out for help.
^0b4

If [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is in command of the characters' ship, then he steers it to the riverbank and demands that the characters help the warrior. The warrior is a paladin serving Kelemvor named Sir Calenhad Strongheart (lawful neutral [death knight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) that is a Humanoid and doesn't have the Marshal Undead trait or Hellfire Orb action).

Calenhad battles against a dozen [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md), a pair of [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) and nine [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md). These creatures are led by a powerful [greater tyrant shadow](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/greater-tyrant-shadow-coa.md) (see appendix B). This tyrant shadow was spawned from the archdevil [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) millennia ago.

Calenhad has been tasked by the archdevil [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) with killing the tyrant shadow, for the creature has been subtly undermining his machinations. [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) convinced the paladin that the tyrant shadow was responsible for the death of his family and their souls will be consigned to the Nine Hells unless he kills the creature (all lies). To help Calenhad in his quest, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) granted him Infernal Plate Armor and a Sword of Retribution (see appendix D for details about both items.) These items have been slowly twisting the paladin.

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) asks the characters to subdue the paladin so he can remove the cursed items and heal him of infernal corruption. If they succeed in this, Calenhad stays below decks slowly recovering. If you want, he may come to the rescue of the characters at a key moment in the story.

## Asmodeus and the Nine Sins

It is important to remember that [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has lured the characters (and many others) into the Nine Hells to be corrupted. There are many instances in the adventure where [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) tempts the characters. It is entirely likely that characters won't give in to any of the temptations put before them, but it is important that they feel at least a little tempted during the adventure.

### Corruption

The temptations have real effect on the game, by modifying the amount of corruption for each character. The more corrupt a character, the more likely it is that they succumb to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s manipulations. Keep track of the individual characters corruption scores on the "Corruption Tracker" found in appendix E. All characters start with a Corruption of 0, but are modified by the following:

- Evil characters start with 1 corruption point.  
- Characters searching for their own damned soul gain an additional corruption point.  
- If the party aligns with the Deathstalker patron, each character gains an additional corruption point.  

When a character gives in to one of the temptations an additional 2 corruption points are awarded to them. At the final stage of the adventure, you can tally the scores for each character. Use the Corruption Score table found in appendix E to see if a character has been ensnared by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).

### Types of Player Goals

Any temptation must fit the goals of a player as it relates to their character. All temptations are grouped into one of the following categories:

- **Power.** These temptations provide magic items, spells, special abilities, and minions.  
- **Knowledge.** Discovering the location of fabled sites, the secrets of creation, the weakness of enemies, and the true thoughts of others are possible with these temptations.  
- **Privation.** Temptations of this kind involve relieving privation by means of restoring hit points, lost abilities, and providing protection from death.  
- **Roleplaying.** These temptations help achieve character-specific but non-power-related goals—the death of enemies, the benefit of friends, family, community or dependents in need, the altering of a political status quo, the location of some lost icon of cultural or family significance. Titles and status. These rely on the character's backstory having appropriate material, and the player being sufficiently invested in it.  

### The Temptations

Throughout the story [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) tries to tempt the characters. Each is optional, so feel free to skip a temptation, especially if another one has recently been triggered, or move them to another part of the Nine Hells. However, make sure that each character is tempted at least a few times throughout the adventure.

The benefits and drawbacks of temptations are described in detail on the following pages. Most of these temptations have been placed in specific locations within the various layers of the Nine Hells and the details of discovering them are explained in an appropriate sidebar in that layer. Not all the temptations have been directly placed, however. In some locations a prompt appears to select one from the Random Temptations table instead. When this occurs, roll on the table, or select the temptation most appropriately tantalizing to one of the characters.

## Let Me Tempt You

Each of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s temptations is designed to use one of the primary sins to ensnare its target. Whether one lusts for power, knowledge or riches [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has designed an appropriate temptation. The temptations are listed under their corresponding sin.

### Anger

> [!quote] A quote from [Bel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bel-coa.md)  
> 
> Anger is forged in the fires of the Nine Hells.

#### The Sentient Artifact (Power)

The characters find an ancient sentient artifact of the Blood War. It promises to give one of them great power in the form of rage. Once it has granted the power to one of the characters, the sentience of the artifact winks out and it becomes a nonmagical lump of metal. Whoever was granted the power gains the following feature. When taking damage, you may use a reaction to enter an infernal fury. Each time you activate this fury, you select one of the following features:

- When making a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +4 bonus to the damage roll. Also, when you take damage, you may use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against the creature that damaged you if they're in reach.  
- When making a spell attack, you gain a +4 bonus to the damage roll. Also, when you take damage, you may use your reaction to cast a cantrip, targeting the creature that damaged you.  

Your fury lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you have the [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You gain one level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) when the fury ends unless you damaged a non-evil creature while using this fury. You can't activate infernal fury again until after you finish a long rest.

#### The Cultists (Knowledge)

A group of ten fanatics (lawful neutral [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md)) marches down a road chanting a prayer. The prayer describes how they gain esteem in the eyes of their god through the righteous and holy action of destroying false knowledge. Their beliefs should conflict severely with the beliefs of at least one of the characters. It should be clear that if allowed to proceed they intend to travel to the Material Plane and destroy a magical academy, a church, or a druid grove, meaningful to a character. There is no reasoning with them. Stopping their threat now, with no witnesses, is a temptation that is hard to ignore.

#### Gauntlets of Rage (Privation)

A devil offers to sell one of the characters a powerful magic item known as the Gauntlets of Rage (see appendix D).

#### Vengeance Is Yours (Roleplaying)

A horned devil arrives on [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge. He offers, for the incredibly small price of 100 gp, vengeance on a dead enemy whose soul is in the Nine Hells. The devil insists there's no harm in it. After all, the soul is already being tortured anyway. If a character accepts, then the horned devil has the soul teleported to the barge away from the soul's current place of torment. The soul appears with all the statistics they had while alive, except they're restrained with infernal iron bonds. The character may inflict any punishment upon them that they desire but if slain, the soul vanishes, presumably returning to their former punishments.

### Betrayal

> 
> You can only understand good and evil if you have betrayed the former for the latter.

![Levistus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/061-0.webp#center)

#### Mixed Blessings (Power)

A [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) offers to grant one of the characters a blessing to help in their quest. The fiend claims to want to embarrass [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), but the character must accept the blessing without knowing what it does.

##### Blessing of Power

Your attacks ignore the damage resistance of any creature you damage. Unfortunately, your parents, siblings, and children become cursed. While cursed in this way, they each have the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until their curse is ended by a [Remove Curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic, or until the blessing is removed from you with a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell.

#### If I Could Read Your Mind (Knowledge)

A character is given the opportunity to be privy to the thoughts of a mentor, family member, liege or superior, sold to them on the basis that they will always be able to act in that character's best interests. The ability occurs at will but also sporadically without asking, and the information they receive verges into the embarrassing, humiliating and awkward, and their betrayal is one of invasion of privacy.

#### Nothing Can Touch Me (Privation)

The characters find a ring on the finger of a devil that they've slain. This magic item is the Ring of Treachery (see appendix D).

#### What Is Rightfully Mine (Roleplaying)

A character whose background is tied in with an organization, liege lord, or similar, is introduced to a devilish counterfeiter with 'evidence' proving their right to a superior title—throne, inheritance, office land or item—maybe something they've always believed they should have had. The 'evidence' has a blank where their name could go, but what's the harm in taking it? After all, if they don't, what if the seller offers the same to someone else? Once they have the evidence, they find they can't destroy or get rid of it—the item, increasingly incriminating, keeps appearing on their person or even nearby where anyone might stumble over it.

### Deceit

> [!quote] A quote from [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)  
> 
> Deceit allows those with less power and excellence to pretend otherwise.

![Baalzebul and Mammon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/062-0.webp#center)

#### The Liar (Power)

A [succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md) offers to give one of the characters the power of deception in exchange for a minor magic item or a single Soul Coin.

##### Power of Deception

You gain expertise in the Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) skill. However, anything said in good faith and sincerity comes out sounding false and unconvincing. To persuade people, you must couch everything as a chain of falsehoods. When speaking the truth, you have disadvantage on all Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks.

#### As Good an Answer (Knowledge)

One of the characters is given the chance to create the answer to a question that has vexed academics for an age. The truth of the matter is lost beyond even the most powerful divination or is known only to extremely close-mouthed gods. However, an [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse)—or another powerful devil—suggests that, given nobody knows, the character has the opportunity to use their own preferred answer, which the devil ensures is spread through the mortal planes and accepted as the definitive truth. Only the character will ever know that it's a lie...

#### Life After Death (Privation)

The characters find the Amulet of Duplicity (see appendix D) around the neck of a defeated enemy.

#### The Lookalike (Roleplaying)

A [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B) offers one of the characters the services of a [doppelganger](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md). The doppelganger will faithfully impersonate NPCs of the character's acquaintance and act in their stead, perhaps to help the character's family, community, or allies. A corrupt local official might suddenly step down from their post. A local judge or king might decide in the character's favor. An enemy warlord will suddenly lead their horde in a different direction. What good might not be accomplished with a little duplicity?

### Greed

> [!quote] A quote from [Mammon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mammon-coa.md)  
> 
> Greed makes you free, and accountable to no one.

#### Box of Treats (Power)

The characters find a transparent box that contains several powerful items. Select one rare or very rare item from the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for every two characters, rounded down. The box is invulnerable to all damage. It has no lock or lid. Inscribed in golden letters on top are instructions written in Infernal for opening it. Only with the blood of a good creature can the box be opened and only by the person who killed this creature. Once opened, the box vanishes, leaving only the items.

#### A Head for Knowledge (Knowledge)

The characters find a withered devil skull known as the Skull of Selfish Knowledge (see appendix D).

#### Save It for a Rainy Day (Privation)

The characters find the [Vial of Greed](Mechanics/items/vial-of-greed-coa.md) (see appendix D) in the hoard of one of their defeated enemies.

#### The Greedy Art Lover (Roleplaying)

The characters find a magic ring known as the [Ring of Collecting](Mechanics/items/ring-of-collecting-coa.md) (see appendix D) in the ice fields of Stygia.

### Harm

> [!quote] A quote from [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md)  
> 
> What further harm could I possibly bring to the wretchedness of mortals.

![Mephistopheles and Fierna](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/063-0.webp#center)

#### Non-Lethal Weapon (Power)

The characters discover a melee weapon of a kind that one of them is proficient with. This is the [Weapon of Agonizing Paralysis](Mechanics/items/weapon-of-agonizing-paralysis-coa.md) (see appendix D).

#### The Stuff of Nightmares (Knowledge)

The characters find an ancient tome that if read in its entirely grants the reader a magical power. Once a creature has been granted this power, the tome loses its magic.

##### Gift of Nightmares

You force a creature that has the [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition within 120 feet of you to have a terrifying experience. The creature begins to shriek from a vivid, pain-filled nightmare that lasts for 8 hours, or until they're forcibly awakened. You gain advantage on Intelligence saving throws, Intelligence checks, and are considered proficient when doing an Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History), [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation), [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check for 1 hour. If the tortured creature is woken during that time, these benefits immediately end. Once this ability is used it can't be used again until you finish a long rest.

#### Carved in Flesh (Privation)

The characters find a magic cutting knife known as the [Knife of Stolen Resistance](Mechanics/items/knife-of-stolen-resistance-coa.md) (see appendix D).

#### A Torturer in Hell (Roleplaying)

The characters come across a past enemy, or some ancestral foe, being tormented in the Nine Hell. The torturers offer them a chance to wield the lash, or they can suggest even worse punishments for the villain.

### Jealousy

> [!quote] A quote from [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md)  
> 
> The lord of these Nine Hells, who was the pinnacle of good, brought low by jealousy.

#### The Jealous Beauty (Power)

An archdevil or pit fiend offers to grant one of the characters a blessing to help in their quest. The Fiend claims to want to embarrass [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).

##### Blessing of Comeliness

If your Charisma score was less than 20, it becomes 20. Unfortunately, every time a creature with a Charisma score higher than you speaks to you, you must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. If you fail, you fly into a jealous rage and attack them. At the start of each of your turns you may attempt to make the saving throw again, ending the jealousy on a success.

#### Anything You Can Do (Knowledge)

The characters find the [Ring of the Copycat](Mechanics/items/ring-of-the-copycat-coa.md) (see appendix D).

#### With Friends Like These (Privation)

An [incubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) tries to sell an [Amulet of Betrayal](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-betrayal-coa.md) (see appendix D) to one of the characters.

#### Credit Where Credit Is Due (Roleplaying)

An [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) standing on the shore of the River Styx offers the characters a view of the mortal realms. A bard is singing the story of one character's greatest past exploits but tells it so that some other—a different character or some past NPC—is given the credit for their triumphs. The devil offers to ensure its servants in the mortal planes take the bard aside and explain the true version of events to them. After all, truth is a virtue, isn't it?

### Murder

> [!quote] A quote from [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)  
> 
> Behold Dis, where murder is always for sale.

![Belial and Dispater](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/064-0.webp#center)

#### Two Kills for One (Power)

The characters come across a powerful weapon wielded by an enemy that they must defeat. This weapon can be any rare or very rare weapon from the "Dungeon Master's Guide" and it gains the following property, which anyone wielding this weapon becomes aware of the moment they touch it.

##### Damnation

Each time this weapon strikes a killing blow, a random evil mortal on another plane dies and is sent to the Nine Hells, prematurely. Likely this victim would always have ended up the Nine Hells anyways, but you rob them of any chance to redeem themselves before dying.

#### The Heretic Priest (Knowledge)

The characters come across a crusading [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of an opposing faith. They overhear him bartering for diabolic aid with a [succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md). He is asking for help in finding a repository of lore. This hidden library contains many tomes that are sacred to a god that one of the characters worships. It becomes clear that the cleric intends to destroy the library on the basis that heresy is contained therein. The cleric is obviously easy prey, and the characters could kill him without any repercussion.

#### To Cheat Death (Privation)

A succubus offers to inscribe a magic tattoo on one of the characters that she claims guards against death.

##### Tattoo of Recovery

The first time you would take damage and drop to 0 hit points, you can choose instead to drop to 1 hit point and be transported to an extradimensional space. While in this space you regenerate 10 hit points at the start of each turn. You may leave the space at any time and reappear in the spot that you left or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.

However, the tattoo makes it clear that its power is drawn from prisoners held in a dungeon on the mortal planes, to be sacrificed as living batteries for tattoos such as this.

#### A View to a Kill (Roleplaying)

While [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge is docked at any port along the River Styx, a [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B) saunters on board and claims to be impressed by the deeds that the characters have accomplished over their careers. She lists some of their accomplishments, showing that she is indeed aware of them. She then claims to know of someone that has annoyed them in the past. You can choose an enemy from a previous adventure that is still alive or an NPC that is disliked. This person is a minion who has served the interests of the Nine Hells—helping them corrupt the very souls the characters are here to rescue—but their usefulness is at an end. She unveils a mirror that shows the NPC either asleep, eating, traveling, or performing some other mundane activity. Behind them, unsuspected but visible to the characters, is an assassin. At the word of any of the characters the assassin strikes and slays the target.

### Oppression

> [!quote] A quote from [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md)  
> 
> The most beautiful music is the silence of the good over the suffering of the oppressed.

![Glasya and Asmodeus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/065-0.webp#center)

#### The Angry Djinni (Power)

An [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) comes aboard [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge and makes an offer to the characters. It will bind a [djinni](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) into their service for the small price of 500 gp. The characters later learn that the djinni can't be freed because it would immediately take its revenge. If the characters don't take the djinni along to help in the adventure, it causes problems for [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) and the barge. Each time it is left on the barge, the djinni causes damage that requires `1d4` days of repair before it can resume its journey along the River Styx.

#### Painful Knowledge (Knowledge)

The characters find a magic iron mirror known as the [Sage's Mirror](Mechanics/items/sages-mirror-coa.md) (see appendix D).

#### No Pain No Gain (Privation)

A suit of magic plate armor is discovered by the characters, either the [Armor of Invulnerability](Mechanics/items/armor-of-invulnerability.md) or [Plate Armor of Etherealness](Mechanics/items/plate-armor-of-etherealness.md).

However, the magic comes from the souls of the living, and every time the wearer is hit for damage, the bound souls shriek in agony.

#### A Palace Fit for a King (Roleplaying)

The characters encounter a powerful devil ([pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md), archdevil, or similar) who offers to build them a great fortress, temple, or other coveted structure in the mortal realm for when they return. The devil returns within a week or two to show how far construction is coming along. The devil opens a window to view the construction taking place in their world. They see that the labor is being done by a legion of bound workers who are being worked mercilessly and without cease until the project is complete.

### Pride

> [!quote] A quote from [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)  
> 
> You mortals should take pride in how you can make a Hell out of any Heaven.

#### Gaining the Advantage (Power)

A devil offers to etch a magic clover-shaped tattoo into a character's skin.

##### Clover Tattoo

This tattoo has 3 charges and regains expended charges at dusk. As an action you may expend 1 charge to gain advantage on your next ability check. However, if you fail that ability check this item loses all charges and you have disadvantage on all ability checks until dusk.

#### You Must Speak Up (Knowledge)

A devil offers to etch a magic tattoo into a character's skin.

##### Tattoo of Knowledge

The tattoo gives you access to knowledge you normally would not have. As an action you may cast either of the following spells. Once one of them is cast, neither can be cast again until you finish a long rest. The spells are:

- [Contact Other Plane](Mechanics/spells/contact-other-plane.md)  
- [Scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) (the target's spell save DC is always 20)  

However, if you ever fail an Intelligence or Wisdom ability check, you have disadvantage on all further Intelligence or Wisdom ability checks until you finish a long rest.

#### A Thing of Beauty (Privation)

The characters find the [Amulet of Appearance](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-appearance-coa.md) (see appendix D), which ensures that whoever wears it always appears immaculate.

#### Taking Pride in Your Work (Roleplaying)

Nothing is more important than your good name. A devil offers a bargain appropriate to the character, that bestows the character a special power. Every time the character kills or hurts a non-evil creature that didn't start hostilities, they gain a Pride Point. If the character finishes a long rest without having spent a single Pride Point since their last long rest, they lose all remaining Pride Points. They can spend a Pride Point to gain advantage on a single Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

## The Dukes

On the River Styx, the deadliest threat the characters may encounter arises from two menacing infernal vessels: one is a warship led by the archdevil brothers, Adramalech and Morax, the other, a submersible commanded by [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), an archdevil in the service of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md). More information on these infernal ships can be found in chapter 11, "Hunted by the Dukes."

These archdevils come after the characters once they've completed one of their group patron's objectives. Once this happens, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) realizes that the characters might be more tenacious than he anticipated and so sends the brothers to take them captive. On the other hand, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) wants vengeance on [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) and the characters for summoning him to the mortal plane, thus he sends [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) to hunt them down.

![Abigor is always ready for battle.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/066-0.webp#center)

## Life in the Nine Hells

Surviving in the Nine Hells is entirely dictated by one's ability to follow mindless legal codes and a self-preservation instinct that has no qualms about backstabbing. New arrivals find that, unless they offer a uniquely powerful skillset, they're the lowest of the low, used only as cannon fodder in the Blood War. Moving through the ranks requires either manipulating the strict laws of the realm, betraying comrades, or commanders—or sometimes both. Devils that find themselves higher in the hierarchy tend to lead relatively comfortable lives, so long as they obey their superiors and maintain a steady stream of souls. For the battle-hungry, the Blood War always longs for more combatants, and proving oneself on the battlefield is a surefire way to a quick promotion. As for the various non-devil inhabitants, existence remains possible so long as it doesn't interfere with devilish schemes. For mortals? Just try not to die.

## Features of the Nine Hells

In the Nine Hells, everything is subject to corruption, from spells to magic items to the very map you use as a guide.

### Telepathic Spells

The archdevils of the Nine Hells rule their realms with an iron fist. The devils that make up their ranks are heavily monitored and strictly controlled. All communication received in or sent from the Nine Hells can therefore be overheard. If they want to, the archdevils can eavesdrop on communication spells such as [Message](Mechanics/spells/message.md) and [Sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md). Even when magic items (like [Sending Stones](Mechanics/items/sending-stones.md) or a [Helm of Telepathy](Mechanics/items/helm-of-telepathy.md)) are used to communicate, the archdevils can listen in.

In the Nine Hells, it is safe to assume that someone is always listening. This has left the occupants of the Nine Hells in a constant state of paranoia. Anyone who tries to communicate telepathically here, has the unnerving feeling of an infernal presence listening in. There is only one exception: [Rings of Mind Shielding](Mechanics/items/ring-of-mind-shielding.md). Even in the Nine Hells, these rings shield telepathic communications from being overheard. These items are therefore highly sought after by those denizens of the Nine Hells who wish to keep their thoughts private from their lords.

### Teleportation Spells

Many teleportation spells have altered effects when cast in the Nine Hells, including spells cast from magic items or artifacts, and class abilities that duplicate the effects of spells.

**Effects of the Nine Hells on Teleportation**

| Spells | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| [Gate](Mechanics/spells/gate.md), [Plane Shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) or similar magic | These spells can only be used to travel to layers of the Nine Hells above the one that the caster is currently on. |
| [Teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md), [Teleportation Circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) or similar magic | Each layer of the Nine Hells is considered its own plane of existence. Thus, it isn't possible to teleport between the layers. |
| [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) | A [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell can be used to transport the caster and companions to a deeper layer of the Nine Hells, provided the caster succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails and has no effect. |
| [Word of Recall](Mechanics/spells/word-of-recall.md) | This spell fails if it would take the caster to a layer of the Nine Hells lower than the one they're currently on. |
^effects-of-the-nine-hells-on-teleportation

### Devilish Distances

The Nine Hells is in constant flux, with the landscape warping to the whims of the devils, and at times, the Nine Hells itself. The distance between locations—and the time required to travel—is up to the DM. A trek towards an infernal tower might take only two hours, but the return journey could last weeks. And locations that the characters were certain were in a particular location one day may relocate themselves to another area of the Nine Hells on their next visit.

> [!note] Tiax to the Rescue
> 
> If the characters ever become separated from [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge, have [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) show up after `1d4` days and complain to them about how hard it was to track them down. He casts [Teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md) to return them to the barge.
^tiax-to-the-rescue

### Using an Infernal Map

As the characters explore the Nine Hells, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) sometimes provides an infernal map when they enter one of the adventure regions. Whenever a character attempts to travel to a location marked on one of these maps, they must match what they see with what is drawn on the map. To do this, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. If they're being helped by a native of the region, then they make this check with advantage.

Success means that they arrive at the location they're traveling to. However, depending on the adventure, they may still encounter something unexpected along the way.

Failure means they become lost. They wander for hours to the point of exhaustion. Unless they make camp for a short or long rest, each character gains a level of exhaustion. Failure might have additional effects depending on the adventure.

### The River Styx

In the mortal world, springs bring water to the surface, trickling lines of liquid coming together, forming streams of ever-increasing size until they feed into great rivers. The River Styx is different, like the Ouroboros, it feeds in on itself. Smaller branches circle around, and, on an adjacent layer of the Nine Hells, feed back into the river. This is of great use to ferry pilots who are familiar with the river as they can use its branches as shortcuts to the upper layers of the Nine Hells and the important locations that can be found there.

The waters of the River Styx aren't just dangerous to navigate. Unless immune to the river's effects, a creature that drinks from the Styx or enters the river is targeted by a [Feeblemind](Mechanics/spells/feeblemind.md) spell (save DC 20). A creature must repeat the saving throw whenever it starts its turn in the river, until it fails the save. A feebleminded creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional deleterious effects.

If a creature fails its saving throw and remains under the spell's effect for 30 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent (no save) and the creature loses all its memories, becoming a near-mindless shell of its former self. At that point, nothing short of a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention can undo the effect.

Water taken from the River Styx loses its potency after 24 hours, becoming a harmless, foul-tasting liquid. However, arcanaloths, night hags, and other fell creatures might know rituals that can prolong the water's potency.
