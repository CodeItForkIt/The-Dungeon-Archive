## Archdevil Lair Actions

Though each archdevil is unique and harnesses a range of capabilities in which they alone are specialized, they also share some common features, especially as they pertain to defending their lairs. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an archdevil can take a lair action to trigger the unique lair action described on their statistic block. They may instead select an action from the following, Archdevil Lair Action list. Regardless of the type of lair action selected, archdevils can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row.

### Archdevil Lair Action List

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](Mechanics/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The Summoned Underlings table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](Mechanics/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
