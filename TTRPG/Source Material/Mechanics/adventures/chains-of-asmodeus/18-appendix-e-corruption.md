# Appendix E: Corruption
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 278* 

The information in this appendix helps you keep track of each character's overall corruption. It shows you the possible endings available to the characters once they reach the final stages of the adventure.

## Corruption Tracker

Use the "Corruption Tracker" to keep track of the number of times the characters have encountered one of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s temptations. Every time they give in to temptation, they're awarded 2 corruption points.

## Corruption Score

Once the characters reach Nessus tally their scores on the "Corruption Tracker" and use the Corruption Score table to determine if they're indeed corrupted.

**Corruption Score**

| Number of Temptations | Max. Number of Corruption Points | Points Needed for Corruption |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2 | 4 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 | 4 |
| 4 | 8 | 5 |
| 5 | 10 | 6 |
| 6 | 12 | 7 |
| 7 | 14 | 8 |
| 8 | 16 | 9 |

## Final Outcomes

Use the Final Outcomes table to determine the path available to each character. The outcomes inform you on how to run the different encounters in Nessus.
