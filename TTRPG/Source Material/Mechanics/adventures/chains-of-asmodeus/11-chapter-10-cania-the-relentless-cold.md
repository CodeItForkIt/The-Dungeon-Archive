# Chapter 10: Cania, the Relentless Cold
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 163* 

![Trapped in the ice, the An...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/162-0.webp#center "Trapped in the ice, the Anakim's brains are harvested to make wine.")

With freezing temperatures and constant blizzards of snow and ice, Cania is the least habitable layer of the Nine Hells. Unlike Stygia, which is a sheet of ice sitting atop a frozen sea, Cania is a massive glacier hundreds of miles deep. Its cold is magical in strength, completely ignoring all protection and sources of warmth that aren't magical themselves, and capable of freezing a mortal to death in only a few hours. Nobody knows what Cania's sky looks like, as it hides behind a white sheet of clouds created by freezing weather.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Cania Overview" section. It provides you with the necessary information as the characters come close to ending their journey down the River Styx. [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) may have a special role in this chapter, so review the "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s Betrayal" section later in this chapter. Ultimately, if the characters have completed their main objectives, the "A Thankful Patron" event occurs, setting the stage for the resolution to the adventure in chapter 12.

### Encounters

This is the last layer of the Nine Hells in which the characters can use [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge. Their final journey takes them through the frozen landscape, diverting down a tributary of the Styx to the Sorrow Mine. Roll at least once on the Random Encounters in Cania table, near the massive waterfalls or after they divert towards the Sorrow Mine.

**Random Encounters in Cania**

`dice: [](11-chapter-10-cania-the-relentless-cold.md#^random-encounters-in-cania)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Sudden winds whip fallen ice into a veritable blizzard. Making matters worse, a nearby iceberg gets sheared, causing pieces to fall to the ground. Each creature within the blizzard must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 2 | A pack of three [vorvolakas](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/vorvolaka-coa.md) (see appendix B) circle in the skies above the icy surface, searching for mortal blood. Canian devils call them "ice vultures." Once they find a victim, they stalk and wait for the temperature to make things easier, staying in the air and just out of range until their prey weakens. |
| 3 | A young [Styx dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/styx-dragon-coa.md) (see appendix B), cut off from the river by falling ice, sought shelter in a nearby ice cave. Without intervention, it will likely die of starvation or frostbite in a few days. It is both defensive and hungry, but it recognizes the position it is in. |
| 4 | [Halogs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/halog-coa.md) (see appendix B) are known to resist the fires of Phlegethos, and as a swarm of four of them runs by, it becomes apparent they can also survive the freezing temperatures in Cania. They could provide a good source of food—if not for the characters, then for the devils native to this layer. |
| 5 | Scouting out the ever-shifting landscape of the layer is a small group of three [ice devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md). Who they work for—themselves, Cania's leader, or some other power—remains a mystery. Depending on their employer and their attitude, they could see mortals as worthy of a fight. |
| 6 | The frozen ground cracks and howls, opening up a ravine in preparation for a coming iceberg. Each creature in a 20-foot-wide line, a mile long, must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or stumble into the opening ravine, falling 200 feet and taking 70 (`20d6`) bludgeoning damage. The ravine could lead anywhere—a subterranean system, ruins frozen in time, or just an empty gap. If this encounter occurs while aboard [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s vessel, part of the River Styx begins to flow into the chasm and he's hardpressed to steer past safely. |

### Locations

The characters must journey to the Sorrow Mine, once they've learned of its existence from either [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) or more magical means. The "Key Locations in Cania" section provides the necessary information for you to guide the characters' exploration.

### Koh Tam and Tiax

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) suggests avoiding being noticed by [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md), fearing the archdevil's unwanted attention. Unfortunately, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is less familiar with Cania. If [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is still with the party, he speaks up, for he has heard of the famed Sorrow Wine extracted from the Sorrow Mine. He suggests traveling there. He wants to accompany them everywhere but behaves oddly–at each new location he should be grumpy and insulting, but then promptly apologize when called out on his behavior.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your player's objectives and lead them to the appropriate areas so they may complete their goals.

The following objectives can be attained in Cania:

**Objectives in Cania**

| Objective | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Phylactery of the merciless | Sorrow Mine: The Mining Town |
| Phylactery of the student | Sorrow Mine: The Mines |
| [Staff of the Magi](Mechanics/items/staff-of-the-magi.md) | Sorrow Mine: The Mines |
^objectives-in-cania

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Cania. You can of course have them encounter more if you want. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

> [!note] Guiding the Characters
> 
> Remember, the characters need to use all their various spells and means of obtaining information to track down the items and phylacteries they require on their quest. Especially if [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is no longer with them and can't provide them with clues. You can also help the players by disturbing their characters' rest–perhaps resurfacing some of the nightmares described in the introduction–as they approach layers of the Nine Hells where objects they need to obtain are to be found. An interrupted rest is a small price to pay to find what they're after.

## Cania Overview

> [!gallery]
> ![Cania, the Eighth Hell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/164-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/164-0.webp#gallery)

The transition between Maladomini and Cania on the Styx is confusing and magical. One moment the river is sloping downwards through a cave system, and the next it emerges onto an icy glacier. While it cuts through the glacier towards its last stop, even the Styx can't avoid the temperatures of the layer. Icebergs and ice floes drift within the river, and its current slows significantly. Along its banks lie the remains of less-prepared boats, frozen over and forever abandoned. A sheer drop at the edge of Cania marks the end of the Styx, where it turns into frozen falls covering an ancient being on its way to Nessus.

In addition to the ice creating the layer, sheer mountains pierce the skies of Cania. Their faces are jagged and unforgiving, and the cascade of avalanches is almost constant. Partnering the mountains are the mobile glaciers and icebergs that carve the landscape. Seemingly with a life of their own, these massive ice structures meander through the realm, occasionally crashing into each other or the mountains in a spectacular explosion of ice and snow. They leave fissures and cracks miles deep in their wake, which are quickly covered by snowbanks, awaiting unknowing victims who then fall to their deaths.

Because of the freezing temperatures and hostile environment, almost no creature calls Cania its home. [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) himself, ruler of the realm, spends most of his time in a heated fortress, protected from the elements. His steward, Adonides, is the only archdevil native to Cania, and he regards it fondly despite the elements. Aside from Adonides, only ice devils (gelugons) live in the icy wasteland. [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) cultivates the devils, employing them as his standing army, spy hunters, and defense throughout the realm.

## Leaving Cania

If the rumors are to be believed, a heavily guarded portal beneath the city of Mephistar is one of only two methods of entering Nessus. The other entrance lies with the Styx and is equally as dangerous. Only by navigating the Styx from its first entrance into Cania can a captain find the exit—otherwise, some form of magic keeps the edge of Cania hidden and the river goes on indefinitely. Where the Styx reaches the edge, it pours over into a massive frozen waterfall, which solidifies around the body of a gargantuan ancient being. Reaching Nessus requires climbing down the frozen creature, a perilous path plagued with deathly falls, dangerous creatures, and twisting paths. Should one survive the trek, they arrive at the entrance to Nessus.

The end of this climb is described in the "Climbing down into Nessus" section in chapter 12.

### Features

Colder even than Stygia, all creatures on Cania face a constant battle with hypothermia. Each time a mortal finishes a long rest, they must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

[Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) keeps a tight watch on any visitors to the realm to ensure no information is leaked. As part of his influence, any Divination spell cast while within Cania has a 50 percent chance to fail. When a spell fails, its materials and spell slots are consumed, but the spell has no effect. Creatures designated by [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) are immune to this effect.

## Key Locations in Cania

![Cania's glaciers hide ancient evils.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/165-0.webp#center)

Some of the major locations found in Cania are described below.

### Kintyre

Hidden inside some glaciers and bergs are strange beings and massive constructions, alien to the Nine Hells. Some of the more powerful archdevils have learned to harness the glaciers and control their movements, constructing cities atop the most stable. Others have carved caverns into their faces, where some claim [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) hides laboratories and libraries of ancient knowledge. Largest among these structures is the ancient city of Kintyre, which taunts explorers with its hidden wealth.

> [!note] Temptation of Deceit
> 
> ***"As Good an Answer"***
> 
> If the characters make their way to the city of Kintyre, they find a community of prospecting devils. They're obsessed with finding [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md)' libraries and want to gain the knowledge found within. Camps have sprung up in and around the city, from where these devils venture out on their expeditions. Enterprising devils have set up shop here, selling maps they claim mark locations of possible troves of knowledge, amulets that protect against the harsh climate, and other wares that would attract this particular clientele.
> 
> The characters are approached by a devil, who is willing to fabricate false evidence within Kintyre to answer a question of great importance. Run the appropriate temptation event from chapter 2.
^temptation-of-deceit

#### Mephistar

Largest of the glaciers is Nargus, with the equally massive city of Mephistar constructed atop. [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) rules the realm from his heated citadel and from here he or his steward, Adonides, control Nargus. [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) has a legion of gelugons guarding the Pit, a shaft rumored to hold a portal to Nessus. It is roughly 500 feet across and several miles deep. A frozen lake lies at the bottom, 1,001 fathoms beneath which lies the portal.

> [!note] Temptation of Murder
> 
> ***"To Cheat Death"***
> 
> If the characters explore Mephistar they risk drawing attention from Adonides or [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md). But if they enter the city nonetheless, a [succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md) calls to them from a shop inset into the wall of the glacier-city. She offers to inscribe a magic tattoo and suggests it protects against death. She charges only 250 gp and has ink for only one such tattoo. Run the appropriate temptation event from chapter 2 if one of the characters gets tattooed by her.
^temptation-of-murder

### The Lake of Wael

Another icy lake resides near the Falls of the Frozen Titan. The characters are directed there to discover items to help protect themselves when they travel to Nessus. Yet something terrible lingers under its surface and the characters must confront it to claim their prize.

### Falls of the Frozen Titan

Once the characters are ready to leave Cania, the most obvious option is climbing down the Falls of the Frozen Titan. If the characters are contemplating using The Pit in Mephistar, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) urges them against it. He offers instead to steer the barge along the River Styx towards the edge of Cania where the Styx plummets over the edge. There they can climb down the frozen river into Nessus. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) docks the barge at the banks of the river, a little way from where the characters must start their climb. Proceed to the "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s Betrayal" section.

### The Sorrow Mine

When the characters first enter Cania, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) gives them the following information. If [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has been disposed of, adjust the text as needed when [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) delivers the information instead:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) braces himself against the skin shredding cold and proclaims, "You ask mighty [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) about Cania? Well of course, you do, for [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) knows all! And he tells you this: not even devils are fools enough to linger long in this wind-blasted and land-locked plane. That is, save the gelugons and their liege, [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md). But they know a thing, they do, the same thing that [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) knows, but you fools don't know the thing that [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) knows, do you?"
> 
> He smiles smugly as if he has provided some great insight. Then he wipes away the ice accumulating upon his formidable brow and continues, "There's a place. Full of big, sad, moody giants trapped in glacial ice. Dead they are, which is good for the devils, not so much for the giants. So, listen to [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) when he tells you this: it's the only place that matters in all of Cania. Devils might call it the Heights of Anakim, but [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) named it the Sorrow Mine. And what you seek? [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) shall find it for you there."
^283

For his own furtive reasons, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) encourages the characters to travel to the Sorrow Mine.

## Adventure: The Sorrow Mine

When visitors are finally able to take it in and understand what they're looking at, the Heights of Anakim are one of the most awe-inspiring and appalling of all the sights in the Nine Hells.

There was, at some point in the shrouded past, a bloodline of true giants, the sort that build worlds for gods. Beings of the earliest creation, when the many planes of the universe were still coming together, possessed of a might and craft no longer seen. As the greatest of giants often will, they fell into a dispute with the elder gods of the time. A war followed, fit to tear the firmament down and sunder the planes. And, in the end, they lost and were hunted across creation by the vengeful gods. In the height of their desperation, the giants made a foolish deal with the lords of the lower planes. Perhaps they were offered eternal sanctuary and preservation against the annihilation the gods were bringing. Whatever the details of the bargain, they were tricked. And yet they were preserved, for in Cania they still remain.

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s (or [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s) advice to the characters is as follows:

- He suggests the characters make their way to the Sorrow Mines, as he believes it is their best bet to find the last items they seek.  
- He warns them to make haste and limit the time they spend here as Cania's cold is dangerous even for the devils of the Nine Hells.  

### Arriving at the Cliffs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You approach a vast glacier face, reaching three miles from the frozen plain, its upper reaches whipped by streamers of cloud constantly pushed past by Cania's eternal wind. The ice is shadowed and discolored. You seem to see shapes in it, perhaps a chance natural pattern of light. Except this effect is no trick of the light. Here are the giants of Anakim, set in the ice. They're the cliffs of the glacier. Packed shoulder to shoulder, toe to heel, wearing rags, their colossal frames emaciated from their long flight from divine retribution. Clutching tattered bundles that might be belongings or might be children. Hundreds of gigantic frozen figures, receding back into the ice until they're just shadows.
^287

Those who get to the upper reaches of the glacier see the faces of the giants. The expressions of semi-divine entities who understood, at the very last, that they had been deceived—and that they were doomed to this frozen, eternal end.

### Sorrow Wine

The mere fact and sight of the Heights of Anakim is enough to bring mortals to their knees, but it gets worse. Whilst devils aren't averse to the idea of just leaving things to be tormented forever, they found a use for the giants. So it is that the sharp-eyed visitor scanning the upper reaches of that appalling cliff finds scaffolding and gantries and excavation. Tunnels and quarries that carve into the literal faces of the giants to get at the treasure within.

Long after the powers of the Nine Hells had tricked the Anakim, [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) discovered the trapped giants contained a unique resource valuable to the rest of the Nine Hells and beyond. A combination of their semidivine nature, the ancient age they were preserved from and their own vast horror at being betrayed means the minds of the giants are a source of the most concentrated misery to be found anywhere in the planes.

The labyrinthine brains of the Anakim contain blue-silver seams of the stuff, that can be quarried out, rendered down, and condensed into vials and barrels of pure corrosive suffering that the devils jovially refer to as 'sorrow wine'. To mortals, the substance is pure vitriol. Concentrated, it causes wounds that strong magic can't heal, and that burn with fresh agony forever. Diluted into a potion it imposes a burden of existential unhappiness that drives the drinkers to empty hedonism and sin as their lives become hollow and meaningless. To devils, the sorrow wine is a potent beverage, a unique vintage of misery fit for the tables of [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md) and [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) themselves. In the Giant Mine, Cania's ruler has a commodity not to be found anywhere else that he uses for bribery, reward, and leverage across the lower planes. His only challenge is reliably extracting it.

> [!note] The Sorrow of Sorrow Wine

> If sorrow wine is consumed by a creature that is not a Fiend, that creature takes 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage. This damage can be healed only with a short or long rest.

### The Sorrow Mine Locations

> ![The Sorrow Mine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/169-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/169-0.webp#gallery)

Locations relevant to this part of the adventure are described below.

#### T1: The Mining Town

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead of you, at the base of those giant sorrowful figures, there are the tell-tale signs of settlement: a glimmer of lantern light and the shadow of smoke blown thin across the gray sky by the icy wind. As you approach, you make out the shape of buildings. A sad collection of crude huts carved from ice and arranged around the only structure that looks like it was built with any care. This building is vast and tall, and even from a distance, you hear the sounds of machinery and harried workers within.
> 
> An odd assortment of creatures use the paths leading from town to mine: carrying empty baskets on their way up and heavier loads on their way down.
^28c

At the foot (literally) of the Heights of Anakim there is a town of sorts. A huddle of buildings, mostly carved from ice, built around one vast hall raised from iron interlayered with the hides of long-extinct monsters, where the raw giant-stuff is rendered down into sorrow wine. Beyond, the cliff face itself is cut and carved with multiple zig-zagging paths up to the heights, along with winches and lifts to take miners up, and bring the yield down. In the town dwells a variety of devils seldom seen elsewhere in Cania who deal with the administration of the mining efforts, the constant infernal accountancy of supply and demand and a modicum of trading with visitors.

> [!note] Tiax Takes a Moment
> 
> The first time the characters enter the town with [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) accompanying them, he hurries to the back of one of the buildings. "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has a mighty burden to discard! I'll just be a moment." If the characters follow him, they catch a glimpse of [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) handing something to an imp that vanishes promptly. If confronted, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) lies and says he was just repaying an old debt. In fact, he is preparing an ambush, to occur when the characters depart Cania. See "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s Betrayal" at the end of this chapter for more details.
^tiax-takes-a-moment

#### T2: Baron Klendisk's Fort

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> While most of the buildings in this town have been carved from the ice itself and squat low to the ground, as if huddling for warmth from the merciless cold, this stone and metal manor has a tall tower rising skyward. This is certainly the home of someone important.
^28f

The town itself is overseen by the gelugons—who shun such menial work—and commanded by one Baron Klendisk ([ice devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) with 250 hit points), who reports directly to [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md). The baron is an ice devil of twice the usual size, emaciated and hunched almost double, usually to be seen squatting on a spider-legged throne formed from an enslaved ice Elemental. Klendisk's public face is that of a monstrous tyrant, cruel in his discipline towards other gelugons and doubly so to any other devil breeds. Behind closed doors, he is a devil with a problem, because mining the giants and producing the sorrow wine is difficult and his own master brooks no excuses. Hence, while a terror to other devils, Klendisk is known to at least give a hearing to outsiders with a solution.

The difficulty is in the very nature of the stuff they mine. The raw seams of misery in the brains of the giants are powerfully destructive. Whilst Klendisk has no compunction about destroying souls or mortal prisoners, the cold of Cania and the corrosive nature of the misery destroys such tools before they can be of much use. Infernal labor has other problems. Contact with the giant-stuff makes them drunk: boisterous and leery with the heady misery of ages. A fiendish workforce would fall to squabbling, brawling and unacceptable indiscipline, even the icy gelugons themselves. It is a pitiful devil that needs to go beg outside help but that is the situation that Klendisk often finds himself in.

Though these mines would seem to be a good place to avoid, mortal travelers do visit. It helps that Cania has few other locales to recommend it, and the town at the foot of the Heights does at least have shelter and goods for trade. Sometimes mortals are sent there by other Fiends, seeking to abstract some of the processed sorrow wine for their own delectation or trade. Klendisk's ice devils keep a compound eye out for strangers, though, and anyone who comes to their attention without a good excuse or permits signed in triplicate find themselves introduced to the mines or the vats in swift order, or else claimed by Klendisk for a little informal torment. Assignment to the Heights is short on entertainment.

Usually, visitors simply stay long enough to turn a profit and then leave. Others hang on too long or try to claw too much from Klendisk. When his temper breaks, he loses all perspective and has them destroyed or cast out into Cania's killing cold.

##### Contractors

Currently there are two major contractors working at the face, and one more running the rendering shed. Both mining contractors, Kargan and Cornelius, have a constant need of specialist materials—necromantic or machine components—and anyone bringing in fresh stocks will find favor with one (and attract the ire of the other). Alternatively, particularly wicked mortals with a solution to Klendisk's labor problems are always assured a hearing. The mines can always use a new contractor. For the price of 300 gp per day, Klendisk is willing to grant a dispensation to the characters so that they may attempt to work the mines.

##### The Prison

In the Sorrow Mines most of the workforce is either Undead or made of metal. However, there are still plenty of devils roaming about, many of them are under the influence of the sorrow wine. Imbibing too much doesn't always end well for the devil in question. The prison at the edge of Klendisk's Fort houses those unfortunate devils whose liquid bravado provoked Klendisk's wrath. It is run by chain devils with several prisoners of little importance currently housed in the cells.

##### Phylactery of the Merciless

The prison is where the soul of the merciless can be found. Upon entering the village at the foot of the mines, the character searching for this soul, feels a strange pull towards this location. When the characters enter, they must evade a patrol of three [chain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md). If they're discovered, they're attacked, and at initiative count 20 of round 5, and every 5 rounds thereafter while combat continues, another chain devil arrives to help. While being attacked in this way, the characters can't easily investigate the cells—they need to eliminate the devils and go back to hiding first.

Finding their way is easy, as the character in question recognizes the voices coming from one of the cells. Inside two figures are torturing a flesh golem that resembles a haggard and emaciated version of the character. The torturers look and sound exactly like the character's true love but are actually [chain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md). If the character slays the devils without exposing their true form first, another chain devil appears in the doorway. They immediately transform into the form of the character's true love before entering the cell and attacking. During these battles the devils constantly taunt and mock the character in the voice of their loved one.

A successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check can help the characters understand that they need to remove the devils' disguises before slaying them. They can use [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) or any other similar means to help them break the magical disguise. Once the devils are wearing their own faces, and then slain, the flesh golem vanishes, leaving the phylactery in its place.

As the characters retreat, they must evade another patrol on their way out, as described earlier.

##### T3: Kargan Skul's Home

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large mass of blue-green ice, comprised primarily of sharp angles, appears to be someone's home. All the windows are frozen over and so thick as to obscure any spying from the outside. Only the massive double doors at the front appear free of such frozen constraints.
^294

This is the home of the most long-standing mine baron, Kargan Skul, and even she, a frost giant, bundles herself in fur, against the uncanny cold of the plane. She spends most of her time at the mines (area T6), tending to the Undead workforce she maintains. If the characters enter her home without permission, they're attacked by Kargan's butler (archmage but their creature type is Undead), and the household staff which consists of ten ogre zombies. An [Alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md) spell alerts the frost giant to the intrusion and if Kargan is encountered later in the mines, she attacks the characters without hesitation.

##### Treasure

There's a [Soul Coin](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md), 10 diamonds (each worth 1,000 gp) and 4,500 gp that can be recovered by pilfering Kargan Skul's home.

#### T4: Cornelius Brassgrave's House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You realize that this is a home-within-a-home when you step through the ice-lodge's door and encounter wood paneling, fine (if scuffed) tile flooring, and a blazing fireplace on the far wall. Near the fire, a gnome sits in an over-sized chair that appears to have been assembled from various cogs, levers, and bits of leather. "It's all insulated," he says, his voice deeper than you expected. "Keeps the outer walls from melting. It is a simple principle, you see, one that involves thermo... well... wait... Ah. Now I see. The giant, she's finally sent you to kill me, has she?"
^297

Cornelius Brassgrave (neutral evil [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) is a gnome artificer driven from a dozen separate haunts in the mortal planes, a creature of pure reason and no morality whose industrious experiments have poisoned seas and turned the living earth into a metal-tasting wasteland. He has made a number of large claims to Klendisk about how his machinery will revolutionize the mining at the Heights and is now finding that even golems and automata can be ground down by the weight of misery. Cornelius is less suited to Cania than most of the inhabitants of this mining town, so he tends to spend most of his time here, in his very warm home. His Constructs keep him informed and alert him to any problems in production.

Another reason that he's sticking to this haven is that Kargan Skul has been in a foul mood, believing him to be responsible for disrupting her supply lines. He isn't responsible, however, and just as confused about it as she is. If he is attacked, pieces of [furniture animate](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/animated-furniture-coa.md) (two [stone golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) with immunity to cold and fire damage) and come to his defense. If the characters slay Kargan Skul, thus raising Cornelius' value to Baron Klendisk, or they deal with the rogue modron in the mines, Cornelius rewards each character with brass armbands, engraved with the gnome's name and family crest (each is worth 600 gp but have no special properties).

#### T5: The Rendering Sheds

![Baron Klendisk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/171-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air inside the rendering sheds is thick with the cloying scent of fermenting drink. Beneath this ugly, sour-sweet smell there hangs a heavy sense of misery, pushing down like an overbearing hand. But, somehow, the modrons that work the sheds have not collapsed beneath that weight. The short, geometrical creatures rush around, checking on machinery and inspecting vast vats of dark liquid.
^299

The rendering sheds themselves are run under a quite different arrangement, one that has persisted for as long as any denizens of the Heights can recall, and which Klendisk himself is powerfully uncertain about. The [Regular Orthoclath](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/regular-orthoclath-coa.md) (lawful neutral [iron golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) with Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores of 16) is a thing of facets, eyes and geometrical shapes from the lawful planes of Nirvana, here with an apparently endless workforce of modrons. They work the vats and stills tirelessly, producing sorrow wine so long as the mines yield raw materials, and never complain or ask for payment. They usually work in teams of a dozen [tridrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/tridrone.md) modrons overseen by a [pentadrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/pentadrone.md) modron. [Quadrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md) modrons are used by the [Regular Orthoclath](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/regular-orthoclath-coa.md) to send messages to teams.

The modron's involvement predates Klendisk's appointment and the devil exhausts himself trying to discover the actual terms of their employment. In the absence of certainty, infernal rumor is that either these are, in some way, bad modrons who are being punished for crimes against lawfulness meaningless to others—or else the whole business is some grand experiment into the enduring nature of law. Certainly, individual workers eventually become corrupted by the work, sad little pieces of geometry infected with emotion, grinding to a halt as they're consumed by misery. At which point the Orthoclath casts them out, and the devils are free to devour or toy with them, not that the creatures give any real sport. There are always, apparently, more modrons ready to troop down from the lawful planes and give themselves to the work.

#### T6: The Mines

Once the characters reach the mine entrance at the top of the glacier, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You notice the eyes first. Each of them is enormous, in proportion to the colossal faces they're set in. Most are blown wide in horror, in pure, undisguised terror. These eyes rest above faces full of pain, with mouths drawn tight in grief or frozen open, midscream. But more haunting than the eyes of fear and rage are the eyes that contain nothing at all. No emotion. Just dull acceptance. There are shapes just above the eyes of some of these giants. As you draw closer, you think they might be caves and then you see the workers that scramble in and out of them and you realize that they're tunnels. Mines. Dug straight through the frozen heads of the dead.
^29b

![The mining of sorrow brings its own challenges.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/172-0.webp#center)

There are more treasures than mere misery frozen in the glacier. The giants were artisans to the gods before they rebelled. They clutch in their colossal frozen arms treasures from elder ages, secrets on great withered scrolls, the raw stuff of creation stolen from divine workshops. An intrepid team of mortals might steal up the cliffs and into the mines where untold treasures wait to be unearthed deep in the heart of the ice. Even the spoil-heaps of the mines themselves glitter with discarded wonders, if only one can get to them. For while the devils care only for the misery and the wine they make from it, punishing errant thieves remains one of their few pleasures and they always look forward to the next visitors—mortals or devils—to try it.

The items of value these giants crafted aren't easily transported. If an entire day is spent excavating, the characters recover a 100-pound statue made of gold and gems (and worth `d12 x 500` gp). However, this excavation draws the attention–and wrath–of the devils unless the baron has granted the characters a dispensation. A similar statue can be recovered with each day's effort, until `3d4` have been unearthed.

> While in the Sorrow Mine, any creature that isn't a Fiend that fails a saving throw, now has disadvantage on all saving throws, including death saving throws, until they leave the Sorrow Mine and finish a long rest.
^the-sorrow-mine

##### The Miners

Most of the workers in the mines are either automatons, under the control of Cornelius Brassgrave, or the Undead created by Kargan Skul (lawful evil, Huge-sized [lich](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich.md) but she isn't Undead, her creature type is Giant). Cornelius is at his home in the town below, but Kargan is almost always in the mine. She is a necromancer of considerable power and her solution to efficiently mining has been to use mindless Undead to do the brute work. She is constantly importing bones and cadavers from elsewhere in the planes, preferring to create ogre zombies and minotaur skeletons for the mining operation. The misery erodes even these, but so long as she can get the raw material, she can keep up productivity.

##### Conclave (Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard)–Staff of the Magi

Kargan Skul wields the [Staff of the Magi](Mechanics/items/staff-of-the-magi.md) (40 charges), carries it with her everywhere, and is quick to use it if threatened. She will generally not relinquish the staff without a fight. However, if the characters deal with the rogue modron sabotaging her Undead workers, she is willing to sell the staff to them, for the sum of 10,000 gp.

##### Trouble in the Mines

There is a steady stream of Constructs and Undead, harvesting the raw material of sorrow wine, and carrying it to the mining town below. The two factions seem to ignore—or not even notice—one another. However, Kargan's workforce has deteriorated faster than usual, with fewer of her zombie and skeletons making the return trek to town. She has attracted Klendisk's ire by falling behind, and believes that her chief competitor Cornelius is sabotaging her supply lines.

Only if the characters are investigating Kargan Skul's claims of sabotage, do they discover the truth. A lowly modron (chaotic neutral [quadrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md) with 50 hit points) has been corrupted by the overwhelming grief permeating the mines. It has gone rogue and skulks the shadows of the mines, pushing miners off scaffolding, or narrow rock bridges when it can. Unfortunately, the Undead tend to be easier to shove than the golems, so many more of Kargan's minions have been lost to the mines, than Cornelius' golems.

After an hour of investigation, the characters come upon the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There's a loud swoosh and you see a strange, blockish figure with wings fly out from the shadows and slam into an iron golem carrying a large satchel of ore. The golem doesn't even register the attack, and continues marching forward, while the winged creature shakes its head a moment before flapping its wings and flying back into the shadows.
^2a0

If the characters pursue the modron, it tries to stay in the air 60-80 feet away from them and fires arrows. It can't be reasoned with. If it is badly damaged, it charges the weakest looking character and tries to grapple them. If successful, it uses its movement to jump into the abyss of the mine with its victim (maximum fall damage).

The characters can use this information as they see fit—if either Kargan or Cornelius learn of the rogue modron, hostility between their two factions decreases a bit. Klendisk, if told, won't reveal the truth to Kargan. He, of course, is more than happy to have Brassgrave and Kargan constantly sniping at each other. He has no interest in his underlings uniting and ending up in a position where they could make demands of him.

If the modron's body is returned to the [Regular Orthoclath](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/regular-orthoclath-coa.md) (area T5), it is taken away to be repurposed.

##### Phylactery of the Student

A character looking for the phylactery of the student, notices a gnome that is dashing between the feet of the zombie workers. The gnome is holding a bucket above her head. In truth the gnome is a shell that is used to torture the student. The soul is linked to the body of a long-deceased female gnome and has been imprisoned here in the mines, enduring the agonizing pain and despair that comes from contact with the sorrow. The student is driven to work harder and harder by the brutish overseers.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gnome sprints past you carrying, over her head, a bucket filled to the edges, the sorrow sloshing out of it as she runs. As it hits her face and hands, she lets out an agonizing wail. Fresh wounds appear where the oozing liquid touches her skin. Her knees buckle underneath her, and she falls to the floor sobbing. An overseer stomps over and starts chastising the gnome, forcing her to crawl back up. With a despondent sigh, she picks up the now empty bucket and turns back to fill the bucket anew.
^2a2

If the characters follow the gnome into the workshop, they are attacked by four ogre zombies. Once three of the brutes have died, Kargan joins the fight to defend her workforce. After Kargan is defeated the body of the imp collapses lifeless on the floor, dissolving and leaving the phylactery in its place. Once the character takes possession of the phylactery of the student, they gain the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

## A Thankful Patron

When the characters are ready to meet with their group patron after completing all of the required objectives, they may ask [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) to sail them to the agreed upon location in Cania. This location should probably be close to the Lake of Wael to encourage the characters to travel there after this meeting.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sailing through the icy Styx is a ponderous affair, as the vessel glides past erratic ice floes and evades larger icebergs that seem to rise from the waters with disheartening frequency. Eventually the barge slides down yet another ice-crusted tributary and crests a bend in the waters. A pavilion-style tent waits along the shore, several feet back of the waters. A banner rises above the tent, apparently frozen in mid-motion despite these gusting winds of Cania.
^2a4

The banner is a deep red with electrum-colored striping if the group patron is the Conclave of Halruaa. If the characters allied instead with the Deathstalkers, the banner is a velvety black, speckled with white frost. The Hellrider's banner is a bright silver, on it their coat of arms is depicted in radiant gold.

### The Hellriders

It is assumed that the characters have used the Hellrider's Salvation ability to safely return the Celestials they've rescued to the Material Plane. If they're still with the group for some reason, adjust the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) turns from a table cluttered with maps and papers, to look at you. His smile is reserved, but it is a smile, nonetheless. "I have received word. You rescued the three from their dire predicaments and fulfilled your end of our arrangement. You have the thanks—and gratitude—of the Hellriders. I know your next steps shall take you into that final layer, where not even we dare to tread. Be yourself prepared before that time—without magical concealment [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) shall surely catch you in his trap before you have even drawn your first breath of the foul air of Nessus."
^2a6

### The Conclave

It is up to the characters whether they recover all the class-based powerful magic items the Conclave helped them locate. Their group patron objective is considered complete once they've dealt with the Unmaker.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tent is empty when you enter, and in fact snow has blown in from the open flaps, accumulating into a low ridge near the entrance. But as you step foot inside, a semi-transparent image of [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) appears before you. He extends his arm, as if intending to grasp yours. He smiles. "My duties call me elsewhere, but I wanted to offer you our thanks. Our alliance has been fruitful and though that business with the Unmaker was unpleasant... you dealt with it like the professionals you are. I—we—wish you much luck in your final endeavors. I believe [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) has advice to offer you, regarding a way to hide yourself from [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). I strongly suggest you heed his words. The Lord of the Nine isn't to be trifled with. I shall linger here a while; in case you need to talk more."
^2a8

[Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) bows his head a brief moment and then moves about the tent, though it is clear he is actually elsewhere. If the characters have not destroyed the Unmaker's soul, they're asked to place the coin in which they've captured the soul inside the Halruaan Ethereal Vessel. The Halruaans dispose of it now.

### The Deathstalkers

The Deathstalker quest is considered completed if the characters have recovered at least 2 of the items—enough to weaken [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s allies and make the archdevil think twice about swindling the Deathstalkers.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rattle of armor alerts you to a warrior's presence beyond the tent, but before you're able to enter, [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) himself strides from the interior to confront you on the snowy shoreline of Cania. Behind him several warriors in dark armor stand at attention, but the tent flaps fall back, concealing the interior.
> 
> "It is done then." [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) says. "Your intent shall take you into Nessus, next, if I am not mistaken. And when you set foot there, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), he shall see you. This, I know. You lack the power needed to hide yourselves from him and I can offer you no help with that. But I do demand one of the artifacts I helped you find. At least, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), shall not be able to recover that from your smoldering corpses, and I will maintain the leverage I require on him. He shall honor his debts without none of his devils' trickery."
^2aa

Once the characters select one of the artifacts, [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) grasps it, nods his head curtly, and enters the tent.

### Parting Ways

The characters, unless they decide otherwise, are still considered as working for their chosen patron, but they no longer have an active mission with them. The characters have fulfilled their obligations, and the patron, by helping them throughout the adventure, has fulfilled theirs. The characters are encouraged to make final purchases from their contacts. The patron remains at this location until the characters return to the barge and sail away.

If spoken to again, the patron encourages the characters to climb down into Nessus, after acquiring appropriate magical protection from [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s watchful gaze. They're also cautioned to stay focused once they're in Nessus—they should obtain what they need from that place and return swiftly.

> [!note] Final Gifts
> 
> This is an opportunity for the group patron to assist the characters. If they require a couple [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) or a small measure of gold, the patron might be convinced to give this to them at this juncture.
^final-gifts

## Before Leaving Cania

When the characters appear to consider travel into Nessus, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) becomes concerned. Before entering Nessus, the characters must find the means of avoiding the watchful eye of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). Magic items such as [Amulets of Proof Against Detection and Location](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md) can do this, but the characters would need one for every member of the group. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) knows of an ill-fated expedition to Nessus that ended in the Lake of Wael. He knows that each one of them possessed an [Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md) since he was the one who transported the group.

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is insistent that the characters would be apprehended the moment they set foot in Nessus, without protection. He strongly urges them to seek out the failed expedition to recover the amulets and offers to guide them towards "The Lake of Wael." Only after some sort of protection has been obtained, should the characters climb the frozen falls of the Styx into Nessus itself. Once they reach the falls however, "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s Betrayal" occurs.

### The Lake of Wael

![What lies beneath the Lake of Wael?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/176-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sailing the Styx through Cania requires the fortitude to endure the constant cold, but also [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s ability to navigate the jagged chicane of ice that the river's surface is plagued with. Visibility is practically nil, with icebergs looming from the frozen fog like great murderous ghosts. And then, when you least expect it, the banks widen until they're lost in the mist and the waters become a rolling chaos of waves, as though you were on the open sea.
^2af

Some interaction of the Styx's unnatural water and Cania's unnatural ice has created a great flooded bowl, a lake whose surface has become a drifting maze of frozen islands. And sometimes there is a voice.

Whilst crossing the icy lake is still a formidable task, the lack of a rushing current allows the sailors something of a respite, as they pole their way through the creaking ice. However, the lake is the domain of something quite other, and has been for centuries. [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) (see accompanying stat block) is a water Elemental of immense size and age. Exactly how it came to the Nine Hells in the first place is lost to time—brought by some infernal collector or slipping through a temporary portal between planes. It found its way to the Styx, losing all recollection of its own past and nature but not simply dissipating. Eventually it reached the bowl of the lake in Cania and settled there, slowly growing as it incorporated the substance of the malign river into its nature until now it is the lake, and the Styx passes through it on its constant course down.

[Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) is obsessed with memory. Although it attempts to sequester its own experiences from the Styx, they slowly leach away into oblivion. Whenever new ships arrive to navigate its icy labyrinth, [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) sees them as a vital source of new experience. It doesn't care what experience. It just seeks to fill the constantly leaking void within itself.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rising out of the water are many figures that, from a distance, look like living beings. As you draw closer you see that they're elaborate sculptures of ice. Fiends, mortals, and unknown creatures are all displayed in the throes of motion. The first few sculptures are impressively detailed, but the next set have vaguer features, smoother faces, and fewer accessories. The more sculptures you inspect the less detailed they become, until all that is left are half-formed mannequins with indistinct limbs and blank, smooth faces.
^2b0

[Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) interacts with travelers by manifesting shapes out of water and ice—the forms of those Fiends and mortals that it has previously taken within itself, that become steadily less and less detailed as it forgets their features, until all it is left with are blank-faced mannequins. Alternatively, if anyone has been foolish enough to look down into the water, [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) captures their reflection and creates an [icy simulacrum](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/icy-simulacrum-coa.md) of them. These creations ([doppelgangers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) with immunity to cold damage) crawl onto the ship and seek to ambush individual sailors and throw them overboard into [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md)'s clutches, or else try to wreck the entire ship against the ice. Anyone ending up in the water faces the effects of a Styx controlled by a hungry Elemental entity. Anyone who drowns in the water here becomes part of [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md)'s library of memories, at least until the Styx abrades them away.

It is possible to bargain with the Elemental for safe passage and/or for the [Amulets of Proof Against Detection and Location](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md) that were lost here years ago. Fiendish ships often carry sacrifices to throw overboard to sate [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md)'s hunger, but it also accepts items of great sentimental value from which it gnaws some mental sustenance.

If the characters don't bargain, then they must fight against a manifestation of the lake. If they defeat it, then [Waeloquay](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/waeloquay-coa.md) quickly moves them to the end of the lake and throws eight amulets into the barge, along with the skeletons still wearing them.

## Tiax's Betrayal

When the characters journey to the Falls of the Frozen Titan and, just prior to descending into Nessus, this event occurs. [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has determined that he must now eliminate [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md). He approaches the characters, alongside the other 2 crew members who have helped [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) and [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) manage the ship. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) follows some distance behind. If the characters are primarily evil, read the following (but skip past it, if the characters aren't evil).

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has a strange look on his face, a gleam to his eye as he clasps his hands together and stares out at the icy expanse of Cania. He lets out his breath. "Now is the time! What time, you ask, oh great [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) the all-knowing? Time for the right and the left hands of the ever-prepared [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) to strangle the very breath from the lungs of pitiful [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md). Kelemvor shall not win this day, this time. [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) the mighty shall not allow it! Dying always teaches the best kind of lesson, do you not agree?"
^2b2

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) presents his deal very quickly. If the characters help him slay [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), he promises to give them the barge, the 20 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) he carries, and swears to Cyric that he will help them complete their quests in the Nine Hells.

Otherwise, if the characters are good-aligned, or don't immediately agree to join [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md), he springs his ambush on them and [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) at this moment instead.

### The Attack Against Koh Tam

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has previously cast [Mage Armor](Mechanics/spells/mage-armor.md) on himself. Regardless of the characters' affiliation, he approaches [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) in a friendly manner but casts [Contagion](Mechanics/spells/contagion.md) (using the mindfire effect). The attack roll required for this spell automatically succeeds against the unaware [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) unless the characters are able to warn him. Depending on past character decisions, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) may have allies or additional opponents as described below:

- [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) has bribed one of the crew members (use the [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block) and they assist [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) in this battle.  
- Additionally, if Grinken Eyre (neutral evil Medium-sized [empyrean](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md)) was encountered in Minauros and not slain by the party, he has masqueraded as the other crew member since then and allied with [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md). He assists [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) in this fight. Grinken Eyre's presence makes the battle considerably more difficult if he is fighting the characters, so feel free to omit him.  
- If the characters have previously met Sir Calenhad Strongheart in the "A Paladin In Hell" encounter, he may have joined them on the barge. If so, he sides with [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) in this battle and comes to the characters aid if the characters do so as well. Calenhad is a lawful neutral [death knight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) that doesn't have the Marshal Undead trait or the Hellfire Orb action.  
- If Grinken Eyre isn't present, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) previously called in a favor owed him by an [ice devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md), who shows up at initiative count 10 of the second round of combat. The other crew member (also a [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) fights to defend [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), in this situation.  

The characters can choose to side with [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) or [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md). If they ally with [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md), it is very likely [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) will perish here and [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) will serve his role for the remainder of the plot. On the other hand, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is very fond of being alive and if reduced to less than half of his hit points (or otherwise feeling like the battle is going against him) casts [Dimension Door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) in an attempt to retreat.

#### Treasure

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) carries 10 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) (he lied earlier about the amount) and so if the characters allied with him he promises to pay them the rest later. If the heroes defend [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) successfully, he rewards them with 1 [Soul Coin](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) each.

## Leaving Cania

The characters are nearing the end of their ordeal through the Nine Hells. Before entering Nessus however, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) offers the following advice. If [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is dead, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) offers it instead, though perhaps not as truthfully as [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) would.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The hard end of the Nine Hells, Nessus; when you've descended as low as you can possibly go. Hearing of it, one might think it isn't actually so bad. Not actively on fire, not frozen, not a deadly morass or a blasted mountainside. Just a regular kind of wasteland, dry and cracked, and finite, past which lies the infinite crimson void."
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) rubs his hands together, to warm them. "In a sense, Nessus is the Nine Hells condensed. All the devils are there, as the saying goes. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) does not brook trespass. The towers of the great city of Malsheem rise from the city's chasm to the highest reaches of the plane, and from them [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) sees all. Once he receives the faintest whisper of an outsider loose in his domain, his eye will find them. You cannot hide from [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), only hope that he has something of greater import to devote his attention to. Mortals venturing here find no respite. Except...
> 
> There is a place. Word of it seeps out into the upper layers of the Nine Hells, and the rest of the planes. Even in the domain of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) himself there is a place of sanctuary—if you can reach it. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) is an archfiend of intellect. He prides himself on his learning as well as his power. It is an offence to his pride that there are gaps in his knowledge. So it is that there is one place that the wise might come to and be safe from infernal retribution. Some are called, and others follow that chain of rumors. All of these come, eventually, to the Oasis of the Lethe."
^2b7

Proceed to the "Climbing down into Nessus" section in chapter 12 if the characters have finished their adventures in Cania and are undertaking the climb. The characters are given an infernal map for the Oasis of the Lethe and cautioned to hang onto it until they need it.
