# Chapter 7: Stygia, the Frozen Sea
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 123* 

![No one finds the Chasm of ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/122-0.webp#center "No one finds the Chasm of Found Things. It finds you.")

Stygia is a vast frozen sea, decorated with ice and snow. Unlike the other layers of the Nine Hells, Stygia doesn't have a capital city, nor a place from which its archdevil rules. Even with a saltwater body underneath the ice, the only permanent open water in the realm is the Styx, which lazily meanders through the entire realm. A constant twilight, accompanied by atmospheric lightning storms, makes the realm appear harsh and bleak—not an inaccurate assessment. Few devils call the layer their home, though that doesn't mean Stygia lacks inhabitants.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Stygia Overview" section. It provides you with everything you need to guide your players through this wasteland.

### Encounters

The isolated stretches of ice that the characters venture across bring with them their own unique challenges. The creatures that can be encountered on this layer of the Nine Hells are well equipped to deal with the frigid temperatures. Roll on the Random Encounters in Stygia table to see which of them the characters encounter.

**Random Encounters in Stygia**

`dice: [](08-chapter-7-stygia-the-frozen-sea.md#^random-encounters-in-stygia)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | One [ice devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) travels through the icy hellscape. |
| 2 | Breaking through the ice to hunt for food, a [kraken](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md) with immunity to cold damage thrashes about. If it spots any prey, such as mortals visiting the Nine Hells, it attacks. |
| 3 | `2d6` [white abishai](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/white-abishai-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) stalk the blizzards, looking for treasure to bring back to their lair. When they spot the characters, they threaten and extort hoping for loot. |
| 4 | A mismatched pack of animals, starved nearly to death, attacks the characters out of desperation. The pack is led by an ancient [mammoth](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md), but also includes `3d6` [polar bears](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/polar-bear.md). |
| 5 | Shouts and sounds of combat can be heard from nearby. A pair of [frost giants](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) are locked in a heated battle with a [remorhaz](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md). It is a den mother, and each of the `2d4` eggs in its hive, are worth 500 gp. |
| 6 | A pocket of intense cold erupts in a 60-footradius sphere around one of the characters. Each creature within the area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 42 (`12d6`) cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. |

### Locations

Most devils aren't foolish enough to make Stygia their home. The characters find no large cities on its surface. However, in tougher climes tougher creatures thrive. There are many caves that lie underneath the surface of Stygia. Here some of the most dangerous denizens of the Nine Hells can be found. The characters need to make their way to The Chasm of Found Things, a vast cavern system that houses a colony of kuo-toa. They live there and worship the terrifying horrors that make their home under the ice. Before they venture there the characters may want to explore other parts of Stygia. The "Key Locations in Stygia" section provides you with the information you need to guide their excursions.

### Koh Tam

Have [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) give directions to the characters before they disembark. He can give information about the sights they may want to visit, but insists they search the Chasm as he has heard rumor of the treasures at its bottom.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your player's objectives and lead them to the corresponding areas to ensure they can complete their goals.

The following objectives can be attained in Stygia:

**Objectives in Stygia**

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Stygia. You can of course have them encounter more if you want. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

## Stygia Overview

On its fiery spiral through Phlegethos, the Styx slowly cools until it reaches the roof of Stygia. From there, it corkscrews downwards, with a frozen bed made from the river itself creating a beautiful sculpture. As it reaches the ground, its temperature and composition etch a pathway out of the ice and the saltwater below. It runs unimpeded through the layer, though the endeavor causes it to have sharp turns, dangerous rapids, and deadly ice tunnels. Concluding its journey at a yawning pit near the edge of Stygia, the Styx turns into a waterfall, falling thousands of feet onto Malbolge below.

Many creatures call the frozen surface of Stygia home, most of which aren't native to the Nine Hells. Small pockets of warmer temperature dot the sea, creating arctic swamps of plants and lichen. Animals such as [mammoths](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md), [wolves](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/wolf.md), and [polar bears](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/polar-bear.md) flock to the swamps for warmth and sustenance. In the region of Stygia known as Sheyruushk, enormous sharks the size of whales swim below the frozen surface.

The frozen prince, [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md), is the archdevil in charge of Stygia. When he was first frozen for his crimes, Geryon took his place, but he has since been deposed by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md) spends much of his time observing other planes and hatching plans, choosing to leave his layer a wilderness.

Although no capital of Stygia exists, there remain smaller cities constructed on particularly large ice floes. They're usually near the Styx and are the most lawless places found in the Nine Hells. Because no archdevil rules the layer, it has become a haven for devils shirking their duties or looking to escape. Hunting parties supply the inhabitants with food and experience, and travelers along the Styx occasionally bring trade or souls. The inhabitants know that, should [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md) demand their attention, they would have to serve their master. For this reason, even in their lawlessness, they continue to respect his rule. One exception to the dens of Stygia exists: the city of Tantlin. It remains independent from archdevil rule but follows a strict set of rules and regulations.

![Stygia's glaciers hide many secrets.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/124-0.webp#center)

### Leaving Stygia

Including the interdimensional portals directly connected to the Styx, traveling between layers in Stygia is simple and concise. Entering and exiting the realm is done via the River Styx. Creatures with flying capabilities could fly up into Phlegethos where the Styx enters, or down into Malbolge, but both routes are extremely dangerous. Going up requires navigating the lightning storm, which is powerful and chaotic enough that few make it out alive. Likewise, the pit leading to Malbolge is plagued by falling rocks and sudden shifts in wind pattern, making the descent more luck than skill.

### Features

The cold of Stygia chills to the bone, leaving creatures fighting for survival. Each time a creature finishes a long rest, they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold automatically succeed on the save.

As a haven for devils shirking their duties or contracts, this layer encourages chaotic thinking and rebellion. Non-lawful creatures visiting the plane experience a constant urge to rebel and shirk cooperation.

## Key Locations in Stygia

Some of the major locations found in Stygia are described below.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/125-0.webp#gallery)

### Tantlin

Constructed along a bank of the Styx, Tantlin overlooks a unique branch in the river. Many portals connecting to other planes of existence are tied to the distributaries, and travelers from all over arrive and depart on the Styx. This makes Tantlin a unique trading city in the Nine Hells, with its focus on commerce completely disconnected from the soul trade. While they welcome travelers of all kinds, mortals find the temperature extremely dangerous, and demons are slain on sight by an elite hunting party-turned-police force.

### Glacier of Levistus

This glacier contains the frozen prince, [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md). Trapped in the ice by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) he is unable to remove himself from his predicament. After Geryon was stripped from his mantle, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) reinstated [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md) as ruler of Stygia. However, he opted not to release him from his icy prison. It most likely amuses [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to frustrate [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md) so. Reinstated in name only, the archdevil lies in wait, observing and scheming for the day he is released from his prison. He intends to make it a day to remember...

> [!gallery]
> ![The Chasm of Found Things](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/126-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/126-0.webp#gallery)

Those who dare travel to the tomb of [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md) may spot him through the ice. The frustration emanating from the archdevil is almost tangible in places. The tomb is guarded by a large detail of ice devils, their numbers enough to convince the characters not to linger here.

### Sheyruushk

Near the city of Tantlin a crack between two icebergs gives access to Sheyruushk. Here the sharklike sahuagin are found, sea devils that have made their home in the waters underneath the ice. The sahuagin roam the waters of Sheyruushk. In those places where the ice is thin enough, they can be glimpsed, riding massive sharks, and gliding through the water underneath. However, travelers would be wise to resist the urge to go and see this sight. If the ice is thin enough to allow a glimpse of the sahuagin, it is also thin enough for these fierce aquatic warriors to breach it for an attack. If the characters don't want to be dragged underneath the ice, they best not visit here.

If asked to take them here, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) refuses. He explains that the sahuagin are known to sink ships that venture into their domain.

> [!note] Temptation of Greed
> 
> ***"The Greedy Art Lover"***
> 
> If the characters spend an hour or more exploring this area before returning to a safer location, they find a devilish arm extruding from the ice. It takes half an hour to excavate the corpse and when they do so they observe that the dead creature is holding a ring in its hand, its frozen eyes staring at it in rapture. The characters must break the corpse's hand to take the Ring of Collecting (see appendix D).

### Chasm of Found Things

Those traveling across the frozen wastes of Stygia, looking for a place to rest may be unlucky enough to wander into the Chasm of Found Things. They may believe themselves fortunate, thinking they've found shelter from the icy cold. But they're mistaken. No one finds the Chasm, it finds you. And once it has tricked you into exploring its labyrinthian caverns, it won't let go without a fight. And yet, this is where our characters must venture to search its hidden depths for the things that were lost to them.

## Adventure: The Chasm of Found Things

The Chasm of Found Things is a mile deep rift in the glaciers of Stygia. Ancient and powerful entities dwell in its depths and lure both devil and mortal alike to their doom.

When the characters first enter Stygia, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) has the following to say:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Stygia: the least or the most hospitable of all the Nine Hells, depending on your standing with the infernal hosts
> 
> A place run fallow—if a blasted frozen waste atop a fathomless sea can earn the term—under the hand of an absentee duke. Everything starves in Stygia. The elements make no contracts. Truant mortals come here to evade infernal scrutiny. The wilderness, while harsh, offers a fairer fight for survival than other layers. But Stygia has its own traps and surprises. Devils are cruel, but they can be bargained with. Other fates are less open to negotiation." [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) shudders and draws his cloak closer around himself.
> 
> "Still, you must venture out there, into the cold. Allow yourself to get lost." [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) gestures at the frozen wastes. "Sometimes those lost within the blizzards of Stygia find signs: mortal tracks through the snow, set down recently. Carvings in the ice claiming a place of safety and shelter. Mortals are drawn across the wilderness until they reach the mouth of a great ice cave that descends into the frozen substrate. The Caves of Rest. Except, of course, this is the Nine Hells and there is no rest. What weary travelers have reached is the Chasm of Found Things, from which few have ever returned. It is here that your search must continue."
^1eb

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) suggests that they wander into the heart of Stygia if they're to find the Chasm of Found Things and has the following advice:

- They can't look for the Chasm, they must let it find them. The Chasm only allows itself to be found by those who are lost and exhausted of all hope. The characters must do this by traveling without resting.  
- They should be prepared for the extreme weather, and he suggests they acquire appropriate equipment, magic items, and spells to ward against the cold.  

Once each character has gained a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), they hear whispers and see strange apparitions in the blowing snow, and eventually find themselves near the Chasm of Found Things, drawn to the entrance (area C1).

### Chasm of Found Things Locations

Wandering the frozen wastes endlessly, the characters grow convinced that their search is futile. Exhausted and frostbitten they collapse in the snow. The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score finds a cave entrance nearby.

#### C1: The Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mouth of the cave is a curious piece of theatre. Mortal hands have certainly touched the place. The ice is carved into dwellings—huts and chambers laboriously scoured from its freezing substance. Elsewhere, materials have been hauled in to build huts and lean-tos. There are the ashes of old fires. Mortals have dwelled here, and recently.
^1ef

It is enough to give a living traveler hope and drive devils to a rage. In either case, the idea is to draw the traveler inwards and downwards. From the depths of the cave can be heard faint sounds: the echo of voices, confused and distorted. The caves are occupied; the dwellers at the threshold have retreated deeper into the ice to escape Stygia's harsh climate. And the caves truly are warmer, a little. Enough that meltwater is constantly flowing into them, carving runnels on the floor and trickling inwards so that all the caves resound to the music of it, further confusing the suggestion of life and voices from below. The keen-eyed visitor might feel that signs of habitation at the cave-mouth seem oddly shallow and staged but by then it may be too late. Every visitor drawn to the cave mouth feels a powerful fascination with the depths, a need to know what is down there, the certainty that what they seek can be found below. Those equipped with divinatory magic may discover that the ubiquitous infernal taint of the Nine Hells really is weaker here, and perhaps mistake that for virtue. In truth there is only ever a choice of evils.

#### C2: Congregation of Gjaaki

Progressing downwards from the abandoned structures at the cave mouth the visitor finds a maze of twisting ice tunnels, slippery with the constant run of meltwater, and from this point they're observed. The heedless or weary visitor will just stumble deeper and deeper, but more careful explorers find upward-sloping spurs to the caves that lead to larger spaces clawed out from the ice. Here dwell the first of the Chasm's inhabitants, the Congregation of Gjaaki.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ice around you creaks and groans and the sound echoes frightfully in the cold, still darkness of the caves. There is no cutting blizzard wind, but the chill of the caves is a heavy thing. The cold pushes down until your throat aches and your bones feel stiff and strange. If you hold your breath and listen, you think you might hear movement in the shadows.
^1f1

How kuo-toa even reached the Nine Hells is unknown to scholars, but they dwell here in some numbers, farming albino fish in shallow pools and constructing for themselves a truly byzantine mythology. The Congregation are pallid, eyeless, and stealthy, stealing about the upper passages of the Chasm and sporadically descending on visitors, mortal and devil alike, to claim sacrifices for their complex pantheon of gods. Their theology is entirely unique, quite separate from their usual deities. They worship that which lies deeper within the caves and have constructed a whole idiolectic myth-cycle to account for their presence in the Chasm, which they see as the center of a cold and uncaring universe. They make pilgrimages into the depths, sacrifice each other or those that fall into their hands, and conduct meaningless rituals according to nonsensical texts carved into the ice. Sometimes their artisans venture to the cave mouth and create another fake ice dwelling to add to the lure of the caves.

The Congregation is deranged and murderous, but luckier visitors might happen upon them when their bloodlust has been sated, or when their ritual calendar prescribes periods of contemplation. In times like these their philosophers are only too happy to talk about their beliefs for hours and hours, to the degrading sanity of their listeners.

The Congregation consists of three dozen [kuo-toa monitors](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-monitor.md) and a trio of [kuo-toa archpriests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-archpriest.md). The kuo-toa are in a period of contemplation and therefore peaceful, if not attacked. However, they're so deranged that they provide scarce information and the characters would need to spend considerable time moving between the various tunnels to encounter all of them. If a kuo-toa is attacked here, it summons all its brethren to defend it. If the entire kuo-toa populace in this area is slain, the characters recover 8,000 gp worth of various gems and other valuables.

> [!note] The Blind Believers
> 
> The kuo-toa living in the chasm have [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) out to a range of 60 feet and resistance to cold damage.
^the-blind-believers

> [!note] Random Temptations
> 
> If the characters attack the kuo-toa and then spend considerable time searching or exploring this part of the cave system, roll on the Random Temptations table from chapter 2.
^random-temptations

#### C3: The Echoes

Below, the tunnels twine and corkscrew downwards. In these reaches, travelers might encounter Congregation pilgrims trekking towards their ultimate religious experience, or sometimes fugitive devils—[ice devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) and [pain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pain-devil-excruciarch-coa.md) (see appendix B)—drawn into the caves seeking mortals to torment or escaping more powerful devils. Most common, though, are the Echoes. Read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ice itself contains movement, even as the air carries phantom sounds. There are flickers of motion, ahead, below, to either side. Figures you can never catch up with, the faces of lost friends and family, treasures, beckoning hands. The very ice of the walls is shot through with an ephemeral life that, like the water, is constantly heading further down.
^1f5

Each time a character attempts to move past an Echo (a location marked as C3 on the map), in the direction of the surface of Stygia, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If they fail the saving throw, they gain a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) and fall (they now have the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition). They may repeat the saving throw each hour.

##### Phylactery of the Oathbreaker

The oathbreaker finds their soul imprisoned among the Echoes in the ice when they, and any companions, see a pre-adolescent reflection of themself begging for mercy. Other reflections, devils in the guise of four children, are tormenting the character's soul relentlessly. To save the soul, characters must break through the ice and enter the Echo. This requires an action and, when the first character is inside, they find themselves in a 60-foot diameter chamber, surrounded by ice. The bullies transform into four [chain devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md) surrounding the child (a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). The devils attack the characters.

Whenever a character starts their turn inside the Echo, they take 5 (`1d10`) cold damage. Additionally, at initiative count 20 of round 4, any surviving devils seemingly transform back into children (but they retain all their devil statistics). If a devil in child's form is slain, it vanishes and reappears at the start of the next round, fully healed. At initiative count 20 of round 5, the enemies transform back into devils and this process repeats every 4 rounds.

During this combat, if the oathbreaker's soul is slain, it reappears at the start of the oathbreaker's next turn, but an [affliction devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/affliction-devil-kocrachon-coa.md) (see appendix B) appears next to the oathbreaker, to assist the other devils in battle. These devils can be permanently slain only while they wear their own form. Once all the devils are defeated the echo of the oathbreaker's younger self vanishes and leaves the phylactery in its place.

Now in possession of their soul, the character must escape the ice. However, the longer the characters were inside the Echo, the thicker the ice around them has grown. Every time a devil transformed into a child, the ice-chamber was pulled deeper into the Echo, and another 10 feet of ice grew between the chamber and the original entrance into the Echo. Each 10-foot section must be destroyed as if it were created by the [Wall of Ice](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-ice.md) spell.

#### C4: Angel of the Ice

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cave is large, with a floor that has been worn smooth. There is faint light here, and it illuminates a wide wall of ice covered in complex and disturbing diagrams. Before the mural on the wall stands a manyeyed being of bizarre form, as pale and cold as the ice. Its voice is like the grinding sound of an iceberg shattering. Loud. Violent. Powerful. All around it sit kuotoa, chattering their teeth and slapping the ground, their eyeless faces warped with fanatic adoration for what their Angel of Ice preaches.
^1f8

Like any religion, the Congregation has heretics to persecute. Separate caves hold a smaller community of dissidents led by the Angel of the Ice (lawful evil [deva](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md)). This fallen Celestial claims to have been sent to the Chasm to reclaim it from the Nine Hells and build a gateway to the higher realms, preparatory to ushering in a vast army to cleanse all the lower planes. It is just as deluded as the Congregation, dwelling before a mirror-like wall of ice on which it has scratched out a vastly complex diagram that it says holds the secret to the movements and future of the planes.

##### Defenders of the Faith

The Angel is attended by a cult of kuo-toa that it has attempted to reshape into something more holy, resulting in a curious admixture of aasimar-like qualities into its brood. There are a dozen of these heretics ([kuo-toa monitors](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kuo-toa-monitor.md) that can change the damage type of their attacks to radiant damage). Each heretic carries `2d20` gp.

![A statue of the Angel of the Ice.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/130-0.webp#center)

If the ice wall, or the [Holy Avenger](Mechanics/items/holy-avenger.md) within it, is disturbed for any reason, the following occurs:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Immediately all activity and sound ceases in the iceshrouded cavern and, as if of one mind, the Angel and their cult of kuo-toa, turn towards you. There is no more chattering, no more grinding. Just a silence colder than the frigid air swirling about you. The Angel points their finger at you, shakes their head, and then resumes their strange oration.
^1fa

This was a warning. Any further attempts to desecrate the temple turns the entire group hostile to the characters and they attack.

##### Conclave (Paladin)–Holy Avenger

The Angel of Ice eventually found themselves incapable of wielding their [Holy Avenger](Mechanics/items/holy-avenger.md) and so they ensconced it in the ice. Just the hilt sticks out now and anyone examining the diagram on the wall easily notices it. It requires two successful consecutive DC 18 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to pull the sword from the ice. Each check requires an action.

##### Phylactery of the Business Partner

The business partners' greed in life knew no bounds, as the character searching for his soul knows only too well. The business partner desired riches and he did not want to share them with anyone. The character looking for their former business partner's phylactery finds it here with the Angel of the Ice.

If the character examines the mural closely, they soon realize its importance when they recognize a tiny figure trapped inside. The business partner is wandering the Celestial's mazelike diagram. Their torture is one of endless frustration, believing that within they can find riches grander than any they ever possessed in life. They're consumed by the desperate need to attain them. However, every corner they turn leads to a dead end and is populated with a new horror that will gladly consume their flesh. Once consumed they pop up again at another point on the mural.

The characters must destroy the mural (AC 12, 100 hit points) but the Angel and its cult attack them, as described earlier. Once the mural has been destroyed the phylactery of the business partner appears on the floor. The character takes possession of the phylactery and gains the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

#### C5: The Aboleth

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a dripping sound in the cold tunnels. The space around you feels emptier, the walls have pulled away and the caves that lie ahead are vast and full of lakes of ink-dark water. The dripping sound comes from droplets of meltwater rolling off the distant ice-ceiling and striking the liquid depths below. You occasionally see ripples break the glass-still surface, as though something very large were moving beneath it.
^1fe

At last, the caves begin to open out. A network of interconnected lakes collects the meltwater, each lake vast and lightless. Here dwell the aboleth, each the master of its own circumscribed domain, each a minor deity in the Congregation's tangled pantheon. Chuul servitors act as guards and food in times of need, and the lake bottoms are a sifting morass of bones and forgotten treasures brought by devils and mortals alike who got no further. But even this is merely a station on the way down. For each hour the characters search they have a 75 percent chance of finding an aboleth clutch (one [aboleth](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) and `2d6` [chuul](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) protectors). This chance is reduced by 25 percent for each clutch found.

##### Treasure

Once a clutch is dealt with, the characters find `6d4 x 100` gp and two uncommon magic items from the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

##### Conclave (Artificer)—Manual of Golems (Iron)

A character searching for the [Manual of Golems (iron)](Mechanics/items/manual-of-iron-golems.md) discovers it in the clutches of the first aboleth they encounter.

#### C6: Keeper of Found Things

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Below you stretches the greatest gulf, the Chasm itself, with a craggy icicled ceiling above and only the waters below. To either side a ledge extends, overlooking the subterranean sea and running to the very end of the Chasm. Echoes in the walls beckon for you to continue down the ledge. A whisper inside your head tells you that the Keeper of Found Things has been expecting you.
^202

What is the Keeper of Found Things? Not a devil, certainly. Something ancient that has dwelled in the Chasm and tended its collection for longer than infernal records have been kept. A thing of the shadows that even the keenest eyes can never quite make out in detail or gain a complete picture of. Rambling accounts speak of too many arms, long-fingered hands, a twisted wedge of a head with a vertical mouth bristling with needle teeth. And a voice. A quiet, reasonable (so very reasonable) voice that speaks to mortals about salvation, rest, and peace—all the promises that lured them down into the caves past all those other tribulations. To forlorn devils, the Keeper instead whispers of a great and endless order, a perfect moment of torment perpetually prolonged. The Keeper has only terrible things to say, and yet it is hideously persuasive. Every moment of the journey through the caves goes to prepare its visitors to accept its blandishments. The Congregation's nonsense theology, the Echoes, the tentacled monsters thrashing blindly in the depths, all plant the seeds of surrender in the mind.

Within the icy walls of the Chasm everything that has filtered down to the Keeper over the long years is buried. There are treasures that have washed down with the meltwater or that have been brought by great heroes and devils. There are monsters, trapped forever—dimly glimpsed against the strange flat light that emanates from every direction. And there are the mortals and devils, hundreds of them, who came this far and no farther. Who couldn't resist the soft entreaties of the Keeper. Here is rest and peace and an endless perfect cruelty. Over time the ice draws its captives deeper, to become the most recent prizes the Keeper claims. Anyone who travels to the end of the Chasm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature that fails the save begins to be enveloped by the ice and has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. The [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming encased in ice on a failed save or pulling free on a successful one. Anyone encased in ice takes 19 (`3d12`) cold damage at the start of each of their turns. They can be freed by destroying the surrounding ice, which has AC 13, 40 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

For those of stronger will, the ice itself reaches for them. The Keeper reshapes the very stuff of the Chasm to entrap less compliant victims by drawing forth frozen golems, gleaming facets flickering with echoes drawn from their victims' past. The luckiest might find their way back to the caves, to struggle against the slope and the water, braving all the perils they've already passed for the dubious safety of Stygia's surface. Others, in desperation, might fly or climb upwards out of the reach of the Keeper's influence, or plunge into the waters of the freezing sea below.

##### Treasure

For each hour spent at this location excavating valuables, select a very rare magic item from the "Dungeon Master's Guide" (excluding weapons). However, all characters participating must repeat the earlier Constitution saving throw, or suffer the negative effects described earlier. Additionally, for each character failing their saving throw, a [frozen golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/frozen-golem-coa.md) (iron golem with immunity to cold) emerges and attacks.

##### Deathstalkers—True-Ice Shards

A character searching for one of the [True-Ice Shards](Mechanics/items/true-ice-shards-coa.md) sees it lodged in the ice at the end of the chasm. If they touch the shard while still encased in the ice, they take 17 (`5d6`) cold damage and must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they can't let go of the object and the ice starts enveloping them. The character takes 17 (`5d6`) cold damage at the start of each turn that they're still holding the shard, but doesn't repeat the saving throw.

They can only dislodge the shard with fire damage, any cold damage makes the ice enveloping the shard grow thicker. Once 50 fire damage is applied the shard comes free.

#### C7: The Awful Fisher

> The ceiling is full of deep crevices and covered in sharp, reaching icicles. You can almost make a game of following the patterns of creeping shadows they cast. They seem nearly alive, the shadows, slinking over the jagged surface as the light below moves. Sometimes it seems the shadows shift out of time with the light. Yes. It's strange. Near the ceiling, you notice one of the shadows, a large one, is moving very quickly. Much quicker than the rest around it. The shadow is coming right at you. You can hear it now. Many legs, clicking over the ice and the terrible snapping sound of giant, hungry claws.

The ceiling offers the most mundane of fates. It has one inhabitant, that has scavenged from the Keeper's leavings since time immemorial. It is known to the kuo-toa as the [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md) (see accompanying stat block). Those who fly or scramble upwards from the Keeper's grotesque collection find a great many-legged thing watching them, letting fly with a long, sticky thread. Nothing more than a preternaturally large cave fisher, in fact; those crablike creatures that bedevil the mortal Underdark. The [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md) has grown vast and cunning on a diet of infernal flesh over the ages, though, given most of those who fly into its reach are devils. It is eternally hungry, malevolent, and armored beyond the bite of most blades. After the [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md) dies, it falls to area C6 and the corpse begins to freeze over as described in that section.

##### Treasure

Once slain, the contents of the [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md)'s stomach may contain some treasures. If searched, select two uncommon magic items from the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

##### Conclave (Cleric)—Rod of Resurrection

A character searching for the [Rod of Resurrection](Mechanics/items/rod-of-resurrection.md) discovers it in the belly of the [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md). During the battle with it, the bizarre creature accidentally triggers the Heal property of the rod the first time it falls under 100 hit points. Any nearby cleric feels a rush of divine power emanating from within the Monstrosity when this occurs. A successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check allows a character to locate the [Awful Fisher](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awful-fisher-coa.md)'s corpse, and the rod, before the creature becomes completely encased in ice.

#### C8: Gjaaki

And the waters? Nobody has ever returned from the waters. The kuo-toa Congregation's greatest deity, Gjaaki, resides there, a being of utter negation, an anti-creator. They say that all things that it becomes aware of cease to be and fade from the memory of the universe. Their myths speak of heroes who never were, offered up in proof of the power of this god. Of course, the Congregation are utterly divorced from reality and nothing they say can be taken seriously. But something is down there that even the Keeper and the aboleths don't speak about, beyond the knowledge of devils and the powers of the Nine Hells.
