# Introduction: Welcome to the Nine Hells
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 4* 

This story takes place in the Nine Hells and sees the characters confront its ruler, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). They venture into the Nine Hells to save the souls of their loved ones (or their own) and are aided by a powerful faction. This faction has its own reasons for wanting revenge on [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). With the help of the characters, the faction believes it can deal a devastating blow to him. In return for a favor, the faction provides characters with access to the Nine Hells and a means of traversing the different layers. The characters travel by barge down the River Styx, also known as the River of Blood, a cross-planar river that links the layers of the Nine Hells. Those who touch or drink from its waters risk forgetting their past lives permanently.

The characters try to avoid [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s attention, believing themselves unwanted infiltrators who are there to undermine the Lord of the Nine Hells. Little do they know, they're here by his design. They're integral to one of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s plots, and he aims to recruit them. But to get them under his control, he needs to corrupt them. It took years of careful planning, and now, finally, he has the characters exactly where he wants them. They will be tested, with temptations and traps set which only the pure of heart can resist. Each time a character gives in to sin, a link is added to the chains that bind them to the Nine Hells, to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). Can they save their loved ones without losing themselves in the process?

## The Nine Hells

The Nine Hells is the ultimate plane of evil and the epitome of premeditated cruelty. The devils of the Nine Hells are bound to obey the laws of their superiors, and at the very top of the hierarchy is [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). The Nine Hells has nine layers. The first eight are ruled by archdevils who answer to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.

### The River Styx

This river bubbles with foul water, and along its banks are the remains of thousands of battles. There are captains who are skilled enough to command a ship through the unpredictable currents of the river. For a price, these pilots are willing to carry passengers into the lower depths of the Nine Hells. They're the only ones who know how to avoid the dangers of the River Styx, including the warships that patrol it.

These warships are built from infernal iron (bristling with spikes, blades, and chains) and can travel the waters of the River Styx. Weapons used by the infernal warships include flamethrowers, acid spewed from bronze tubes, and launchers that fire a dozen ballista bolts at once.

## Sins

Sin must be at the core of any story that takes place in the Nine Hells. These Hells are based on Dante's Inferno, the famed 14th-century poem which depicted Hell as nine concentric circles of torment. Each circle of Hell tormented a different class of sinner, from the unbelievers of the 1st circle down to the great betrayers of the 9th circle.

The poem focused on describing the acknowledgement and rejection of sin. In this story, good people have committed grievous sins that will have consequences. Some of these people might be the player characters.

## What Are the Sins?

Each layer of the Nine Hells embodies a particular sin, as described in the sections that follow. Feel free to add other sins, but be careful when you do. Some classical interpretations of sins shouldn't be used in any adventure. Others, such as lust or gluttony, should be handled very carefully.

### Sins to the Self

- **Anger.** The sin of anger fuels wrath, vengeance, and inner turmoil. It takes root in Avernus, the domain of the archdevil [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md).  
- **Greed.** This sin leads to a life of accumulating wealth and sharing very littleâ€”a sin nurtured in Minauros, the domain of the archdevil [Mammon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mammon-coa.md).  
- **Jealousy.** The jealous are never satisfied with what they have. Phlegethos, the domain of the archdevils [Belial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belial-coa.md) and [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md), is where jealousy thrives.  
- **Pride.** Some say that this is the original sin which led to all other sins and is the sin that led to the fall of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and thus is his domain.  

### Sins to the Other

- **Betrayal.** Betraying a loved one, a god, or a sovereign can damn one's soul to Stygia, the domain of the archdevil [Levistus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/levistus-coa.md).  
- **Deceit.** Lying that leads to harm is, like Maladomini, the domain of the archdevil [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md).  
- **Harm.** Mutilating or torturing an enemy is wicked work that warms the ice-cold heart of [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md), the archdevil who presides over Cania.  
- **Murder.** Killing an innocent or family member is evil business that comes home to roost in Dis, the domain of the archdevil [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md).  
- **Oppression.** Unjustly imprisoning enemies and denying their freedom is the devil's work and reflective of Malbolge, the domain of the archdevil [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md).  

More details on the different archdevils, including their stat blocks, can be found in appendix A, "Lords of the Nine."

> [!note] An Unjust Universe
> 
> Some players may be uncomfortable if a soul is consigned to the Nine Hells for a sin when the person so condemned lived a good life in aggregate. However, all the souls consigned to the Nine Hells in this adventure were deceived by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). While they committed sins, that wasn't the reason they were consigned to the Nine Hells. However, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) ensures that the soul is punished as if the sin was the one that defined it.

## Running the Adventure

To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition rulebooks: "Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", "Monster Manual", and "Monsters of the Multiverse". Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus would also be a good source; Chains of Asmodeus can be run as a continuation of that story.

The stat blocks for most creatures in this adventure can be found in the "Monster Manual". When a creature's name appears in bold type, that is a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the "Monster Manual", unless the adventure's text refers you to appendix B (for monsters), appendix C (for NPCs), or "Monsters of the Multiverse".

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook". Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide", unless the text directs you to an item's description in appendix D of this book.

### Character Advancement

The adventure is meant for characters of 11th level, and the story sees them rise to 20th. Creating characters of this level requires a little more preparation compared to 1st-level characters. If you and your players previously played Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus, your players may choose to continue with their characters from that adventure. Or, if your players have other premade characters of the appropriate level, they can decide to embody those characters once again. Players with preexisting characters must still choose the soul that their character is dedicated to saving.

The "Great Heroes" section helps you and your players get started with either creating a new character or with the choices that need to be made for preexisting characters.

### Consider Your Players

Playing *Dungeons & Dragons* is about having fun with your friends and exploring new worlds together. Before venturing out onto the River Styx, discuss the nature of the story with your players.

You will be guiding them on a journey through the Nine Hells and introducing them to the various devils that make this infernal domain their home. The story contains references to the suffering and torture of those souls who are damned to an eternity of torment because of their sins. Make sure that you're aware of any boundaries that may exist, as you don't wish to make the experience uncomfortable for your players. The characters might be on a perilous quest through the Nine Hells themselves, but their players should enjoy the experience. You may need to adjust the story to accommodate all players.

> [!note] Previous Adventures in Avernus
> 
> An adventure that is the perfect prequel to this one is Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus. If you and your players have been on this adventure before our story begins, you may be familiar with some of the setting, and the players' characters should be at the appropriate level. However, depending on the outcomes of your earlier encounters within the Nine Hells, you may need to adjust some parts of the story.

### Agency and Replayability

This adventure has been designed so that each time it is played it can have entirely different objectives and outcomes. It does this mainly through the following ways:

- **Souls.** Each player must choose a soul to save. It might be the soul of a loved one or their own soul. The soul, and the sins associated with it, determine where [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has hidden it away to be tormented.  
- **Group Patron.** The players must decide upon a group patron before the start of the adventure. There are three group patrons, one for good, one for evil, and one for neutrality. Each has their own objective.  
- **The River Styx.** The river passes dozens of dangerous locations, but the characters visit only some of them.  
- **Temptations and Corruptions.** [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) tries to lure the characters into his grasp. Each time the characters go back to the Nine Hells they may find different temptations. Some may be easy to resist, others not so much. Giving in to temptation corrupts them.  

## Story Overview

The Lord of the Nine Hells, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), is known to have countless plots, some that take centuries to come to fruition, while others he conceives of and executes within a few years. This is a story about one of the latter.

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) desires to corrupt and dominate some of the most powerful mortals in a generation. To further his designs, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) wants to convert these powerful mortals to his cause. To this end, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has made pacts with many of the powerful and influential of the Forgotten Realms. This includes kings, queens, high priests, and powerful adventurers. The player characters are among those that he has targeted. When not able to convince such august personages, he has gone after their spouses, children, or friends. He comes to them when they're in need, providing a service with the understanding that if they die before they can return the favor, their soul is forfeit.

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) never intended to allow these infernal contracts to be fulfilled by their mortal signatories. Instead, he has given a list of names to the most skilled killers in the world.

These killers embark on a murder spree to kill all the people on the list, thus consigning their souls to the Nine Hells and to the corrupting influence of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and his court of devils. Among the victims when the adventure begins are the spouses, children, or friends of the characters. One or more characters may also be among those who are murdered.

### Important Characters

These are the important characters in the story:

- **Aeshma (the Unmaker).** A lost soul that the Conclave of Halruaa needs destroyed to stop a dangerous threat. Nobody knows the Unmaker's true identity.  
- **Asmodeus.** The Lord of the Nine Hells, and this adventure's primary antagonist.  
- **Barachiel.** A Hellrider and one of the friends that [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) seeks.  
- **Koh Tam.** A priest serving the God of the Dead.  
- **Ramius.** A contact for the Hellriders of Elturel group patron.  
- **Sarevok.** High priest of Bhaal, and the contact for the Deathstalkers of Bhaal group patron.  
- **Tiax.** [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s sidekick and comedy relief.  
- **Zythan.** High Diviner of Halruaa, and a contact for the Conclave of Halruaa group patron.  

### Prologue

The characters are approached by a representative of one of three group patrons, representing either good, neutrality, or evil. This representative acts as the quest giver and has their own motivation for wanting the characters to go into the Nine Hells. The three patrons are as follows:

- **Ramius, Hellrider of Elturel (Good).** [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) has a deep hatred for [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) because of what the archdevil did to his home city and its patron angel. [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md)' lifelong friend was a victim of the recent murder spree. The paladin wants the characters to enter the Nine Hells to rescue his friend and other Celestials who have fallen victim to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) and the Hellriders know the location of these beings trapped within the Nine Hells.  
- **Zythan, High Diviner of the Conclave of Halruaa (Neutral).** [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) has foreseen a dreadful consequence of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s plan. A dangerous soul known as the Unmaker has emerged and must be dealt with. [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) and the mages of Halruaa have divined the location of powerful magic items that can help the characters in this quest. He wants the characters to gather these, to defeat the threat he has foreseen. These include some of the most famed items in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".  
- **Sarevok, High Priest of the Deathstalkers of Bhaal (Evil).** The Deathstalkers of Bhaal feel uneasy about their alliance with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). They fear he will betray Bhaal and that the divine power promised him will never be given. [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) will help the characters navigate the River Styx and rescue the souls of their loved ones, but only if they help Bhaal gain leverage against [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) by stealing some of the most infamous and powerful artifacts of the Nine Hells. He aims to keep one, the others are for the characters to decide what to do with.  

More information on the patrons can be found in the "Group Patron" section of this chapter.

![The shores of the River St...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/009-0.webp#center "The shores of the River Styx are littered with grotesque landmarks.")

### Koh Tam

The group patron puts the characters in contact with [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) (see chapter 1), a priest serving the God of the Dead. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is an expert on the Nine Hells and knows how to navigate the River Styx. But first, he must learn where the souls that the characters seek might be found. To that end, he summons [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) and invites the archdevil to possess him. The characters must deal with the devil to learn the location of the souls. Afterwards, they must exorcise [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) of the devil's spirit.

### Through the Nine Hells

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) knows how to navigate the River Styx and offers to guide the characters through the Nine Hells to help them find the souls they seek. He opens a portal to the first layer of the Nine Hells, Avernus.

The characters must descend through the layers of the Nine Hells along the treacherous River Styx. It is possible to move against the flow of the River Styx, but it is difficult. However, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge has a magical addition that allows him to use the [Plane Shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) spell to travel to a layer of the Nine Hells above the current one.

The characters have two objectives if they're to save the souls of their loved ones or their own:

- **Finding the Lost Souls.** The main objective of the characters is to find the souls that have been trapped by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).  
- **Dealing with Asmodeus.** Once the characters have found their lost loved ones, they must convince [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to allow them to be freed. They can do this by gaining leverage over him, by performing a service for him, or signing an infernal contract. Characters who are able to resist temptation within the Nine Hells might even find a loophole allowing them to escape, successfully avoiding all of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s snares.  

### Finale: Asmodeus

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) is a lawful evil deity who is genuinely one of the most powerful creatures in the universe. He likes to appear respectful and well-mannered when speaking with others, and he hates being wrong. In fact, sometimes he even pretends to know more than he does, or that he can predict what actions creatures will take before they take them, even though he can't. He enjoys making contracts with others, especially when their end of the bargain is their soul.

At the climax of the adventure, the characters may need to make a contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to release the souls of their loved ones. The characters need as much leverage as possible when going into the contract. Without enough leverage, they may have to promise to do services for [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).

## Great Heroes

This adventure is for high-level play. Players start with characters who are 11th level and are considered Masters of the Realm. Over the course of play, they go beyond 17th level to become Masters of the World. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more details on these tiers of play. There are three steps that players must complete before the start of the adventure:

- Create a new character, or choose an existing one.  
- Choose a soul to be saved.  
- Choose a group patron.  

Players need to create a new high-level character unless they have a preexisting one they want to use. Any player who creates a new high-level character must go through the character creation process and choose a soul that their hero is dedicated to saving. A player with a preexisting character must still choose a soul that their character is dedicated to saving.

When choosing a soul to save, a player has the option of saving the soul of a loved one (detailed in the "Lost Souls" section) or saving their own soul (detailed in the "Souls of the Damned" section). While the lost souls option was designed to work with existing characters and the souls of the damned option was designed to work with newly created high-level characters, the DM can allow players to choose from either. A group can be made up of lost souls and souls of the damned. However, to promote group unity, a DM can insist upon one or the other.

After players have created their characters, they must choose a group patron. These group patrons are designed for three types of play that coincide with good, neutral, and evil alignments.

## New Characters

Creating an 11th-level character uses the same character creation steps outlined in the "Player's Handbook". The process will take longer than usual, as a player must select spells, feats, abilities, and other aspects that a 1st-level character wouldn't have to. A new character starts with 7,500 gp, the standard equipment associated with their background, and magic items as described next.

### Magical Equipment

Each new high-level character should be allowed to pick either 1 very rare magic item and 1 uncommon magic item or 2 rare magic items. These items should be selected from the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Saving Souls

The following sections describe the souls available for each player to pick from. The chosen soul is the soul their character seeks to save. The player can either choose a lost soul, a loved one whose soul is trapped in the Nine Hells, or they can decide it's their character's soul that is damned. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) keeps these souls in phylacteries scattered around the Nine Hells. Phylacteries don't need to be in the layer associated with their sin, but usually are. When characters locate such a phylactery, they must bring it with them for the remainder of the adventure.

Only [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) can break the infernal contract that binds a soul to its phylactery. To convince him to do this, characters must gain leverage over him, as described in later sections.

![Demons, ancient gods, and ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/011-0.webp#center "Demons, ancient gods, and titans... All beings find their way into the Nine Hells.")

## Lost Souls

These lost souls belong to the character's loved ones who have signed infernal contracts. When their phylactery is recovered, the lost soul can communicate with the character, providing advice, guidance, commentary, and even criticism. This type of phylactery also provides characters with a statistical or gameplay bonus.

The section that follows provides examples of lost souls that a player can choose.

### Brother (Anger)

From the day he was born, your brother was a problem childâ€”impulsive, aggressive and violent, though never toward you. He was constantly getting into fightsâ€”most of which he startedâ€”and you were constantly coming to his rescue and cleaning up his messes. But despite his flaws, you always knew he had your back. His temper grew worse as he grew older, and his fights often resulted in people getting hurt. He fell in with an unsavory crew, and you drifted apart. Now you've learned he was foolish enough to sign an infernal contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), and his soul is trapped in the Nine Hells. You can't deny your brother deserves his fate... but he's still your brother, and you're not going to turn your back on him.

- **Phylactery Location.** The War-Slough on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** While you possess your brother's phylactery, you can channel your brother's rage. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.  

### Bounty (Murder)

Someone of your reputation and talent is always in high demand. If the price is right, you'll take on any job... but you don't work cheap. Still, this is the strangest adventure you've ever been hired for. The ruthless matron of a powerful noble family has disappeared, and you've been hired to find her. Your first assumption was that she'd either been kidnapped for ransom, murdered by a rival family, or killed by one of her own ambitious kin. But during your investigations, you discovered the shocking truth: decades ago, she signed an infernal contract to help advance her family's fortunes, and [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) came to collect his payment. Tracking her soul through the Nine Hells wasn't part of the original deal, but the reward for bringing her back is too high to pass up, and you never leave a job unfinished.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Agora of Floating Knives on Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** While you possess your bounty's phylactery, you're more adroit at killing. When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to hit instead. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.  

![Brother (Anger) and Bounty (Murder)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/012-0.webp#center)

### Business Partner (Betrayal)

For years, you and your business partner shared the fruits of your adventures in a mutually beneficial arrangement. Sure, they were always trying to squeeze a few extra drops from your cut on every mission, but you never thought they'd actually betray you. On your last adventure, however, they double-crossed you, stealing a rare and powerful magic item you'd spent years questing for. They disappeared with your treasure, leaving you high and dry. You searched for the precious item in vain, only to discover that your old partner's soul is trapped in the Nine Hells because of an infernal contract they signed with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). The only way you'll ever get back what is rightfully yours is to track them down and bring them back to life so they can tell you where the treasure is hidden.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Chasm of Found Things on Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** While you possess your business partner's phylactery, you have advantage on saving throws against illusion spells and effects that would make you have the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition.  

### Childhood Friend (Sinless)

Growing up, you never seemed to fit in. You were always differentâ€”perhaps that's why you became an adventurer. Your childhood was lonely until you met your childhood friend. Like you, they were completely ignored by other children on the good days, ruthlessly bullied on the bad. But in each other you found a kindred soul. You formed a powerful bond of friendship that allowed you to rise above the taunts and torments of the other kids. Together, you found the strength to survive and flourish. You became a successful adventurer. Your friend chose a different path, one of domestic bliss with a family and a quiet, fulfilling life. Years would pass between seeing them, but you still remained closeâ€”united by your childhood bond. But when your friend's youngest child became ill, they didn't turn to you for help. Instead, they signed a contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), condemning themselves to an eternity in the Nine Hells.

### Father (Greed)

You loved your father. He helped shape you into the hero you're now. He supported your ambitions, gave you advice when you needed it, and was there for you when things looked darkest. Your mother loved him even more, for he was personable, funny, and kind. But everyone has a flaw, and your father's flaw was gambling. The risk-taking behavior that you inherited from him made you into a hero, but he didn't have your outlet. Instead, he took risks with money. His debts grew, as did his shame, but you never knew. Your mother didn't tell you about it until it was too late. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) used his shame to convince him to sign an infernal contract.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Ineffable Trove on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** Possessing your father's phylactery grants you extra luck. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can roll an additional `d20`. You can choose to use this benefit after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.  

### Mentor (Oppression)

You learned your craft at the feet of a true master. Recognizing your raw talent and potential, your mentor took you under their wing and trained you. Your mentor was a difficult master and demanded complete obedience. Over the years, they taught you everything you needed to know about adventuring and life, shaping you into the hero you're today. They shared all their secrets with you... except for one. Long ago, your mentor signed an infernal contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). Now your mentor has been whisked away to the Nine Hells, and it's time to use everything they taught you to save them from an eternity of torment and suffering.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Sign of the Hag's Arms on Malbolge, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** Possessing your mentor's phylactery grants you protection. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.  

![Father (Greed) and Mentor (Oppression)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/014-0.webp#center)

### Mother (Pride)

Your mother was kind and loving, but also strong and independent. She raised you on her own, supporting you by telling fortunes and performing tarot readings for the locals in the town where you grew up. Once you began your adventuring career, her reputation grew quickly. Officials and nobility of ever-increasing rank and importance began to come to your mother for insight into their futures, amazed at the accuracy of her predictions. What you didn't know was that her rapid rise in stature was due to her signing an infernal contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to enhance her gifts.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Sign of the Hag's Arms on Malbolge, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** Possessing your mother's phylactery grants you foresight. When you finish a long rest, roll a `d20` and record the number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with this foretelling roll. You must choose to do so before the roll. This roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose an unused foretelling roll.  

### Sister (Jealousy)

Your sister was fearless. There was no challenge she wouldn't tackle, no dare she wouldn't take. She became an adventurer, living a life filled with thrills and excitement. She even inspired your own career, pushing you to ever greater accolades. But over the years, her risk-taking became a compulsion she couldn't control. She became more and more reckless, embarking on foolhardy quests and what seemed like suicide missions. What you didn't realize was that it was your sister's envy of your accomplishments that drove her recklessness. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) exploited her need to be your equal, convincing her to sign an infernal contract in exchange for the ultimate adventure.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Elemental Preserve on Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** While you possess your sister's phylactery, any effect that applies the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition on one or more targets has no effect on you.  

![Mother (Pride) and Sister (Jealousy)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/015-0.webp#center)

### Spouse/True Love (Deceit)

True love is realâ€”you know this because you were lucky enough to find yours. In a world too often filled with darkness and danger, you were blessed to find someone to stand by you through thick and thin. They supported you when you needed it most, helping you to reach your full potential. Together, you made a life for yourself: a wonderful, perfect life. But now you have learned that your love kept a secret from you: they made an infernal contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to help keep you safe during your adventures. They made the ultimate sacrifice to protect you, and now they're paying the ultimate price.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Eye Market on Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** Possessing your true love's phylactery grants you advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  

### Student (Harm)

You started at the bottom and clawed your way to the top, forging your reputation over the years. As your legend grew, others came to you seeking guidance, but you always turned them away. One day, you discovered a student who was different than the others. Although the student was willful and prone to violence, you still saw a spark in them that reminded you of your own humble beginnings, so you took them under your wing. You helped them reach their full potential, growing skills until their ability and reputation rivaled your own. But despite all you taught them, your student still made a tragic mistake. They signed an infernal contract with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), foolishly convinced they could get out of it before it came due. Now it's up to you to help them one last time.

- **Phylactery Location.** The Sorrow Mine on Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells  
- **Phylactery Benefit.** While you possess your student's phylactery, you can use a bonus action to heal a number of hit points equal to twice your level. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Souls of the Damned

This option is for any player who wants a more personal reason for their character to explore the Nine Hells: to recover their own lost soul. The character begins the adventure having been raised from the dead by one of the group patrons presented later in this book. This group has brought the character back using an ancient ritual, but it is only temporary. The character must complete the adventure to save their soul, or they will return to the Nine Hells as a lemure.

The DM might decide that all the characters have had their souls consigned to the Nine Hells. The advantages and disadvantages of not having a soul are explained in the "Not Having a Soul" sidebar.

### Choosing a Sin

First, each player must decide if their character has harmed themself or another, then choose which sin caused their soul to be consigned to the Nine Hells. Sins to the other represent possible harm a character has done to others, whilst sins to the self represent possible strong detrimental character flaws. The Categories of Sin table outlines the choices a player may make.

**Categories of Sin**

| Sin | Harm or Flaw |
|-----|--------------|
| *Sins to the Other* |  |
| Betrayal | The Oathbreaker |
| Deceit | The Great Con |
| Harm | The Merciless |
| Murder | Patricide |
| Oppression | The Heartless Master |
| *Sins to the Self* |  |
| Anger | The Furnace |
| Greed | The Infinite Treasure |
| Jealousy | The Queen |
| Pride | The Chosen One |
^categories-of-sin

> [!note] Not Having a Soul
> 
> When a character whose soul is trapped in the Nine Hells dies, resurrection magic can return that character to life no matter how much time has passed. For example, a [Revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md) spell works on the character even if a week has passed since the character died. However, if the character's body is completely destroyed, not even a Wish or [True Resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell can bring the character back.

#### The Chosen One (Pride)

![The Chosen One (Pride)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/017-0.webp#center)

You always knew you were special. Even from a young age, it became clear that you were better than everyone else. Because of this, you thought nothing of using, manipulating, or exploiting others for your own benefit. Stepping on the insignificant as you climbed your way to the top was simply the natural order. The fame and glory you achieved in your life only proved you were right all along... though looking back, maybe you pushed things too far. After all, you did end up in the Nine Hells.

- **Character Punishment.** Your greatest fear in life was being inadequate. Now you're haunted by a recurring nightmare in which you compete in trials of skill against other heroes but find yourself weak, overmatched, and helpless.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Agora of Floating Knives, on Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is forced to compete in a series of events showcasing strength, skill, and intelligence. But their soul is merely a weakened shell of what it once was, and they're constantly overmatched by their fellow competitors. With each loss, they're humiliated, mocked, and made to suffer painful punishments for their failure. To free their soul, the character must take their place in these events; they must compete and win.  

#### The Furnace (Anger)

There has always been a fire inside you, a dangerous fury, just waiting to be unleashed upon the world in a storm of violence. The rage gave you strength and power. It helped you defeat your enemies and forge your legend... but there was a cost to your anger. Those around you quickly learned not to try your temper, but over the years it was inevitable that something would set you off from time to time. When it was unleashed, your wrath was terrifying to behold... but it also led you to do things you'd later regret. People suffered. People died. Some deserved it, but many did not. Given what you've doneâ€”what your anger made you doâ€”you've known for a long time where you were going to end up when you died.

- **Character Punishment.** The color of your sleep is red: blood, fire, burning rage. You don't dreamâ€”not in the normal sense. When you close your eyes, all you see is red. You wake bathed in sweat, with your heart pounding, but you can't remember any details beyond that single color. Red.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Elemental Preserve, Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is forced to shovel coal into a massive furnace, whipped to greater and greater efforts by several efreet with flaming scourges. No matter how much fuel is thrown into the furnace, the roaring flames instantly devour it in a burst of searing heat. To free this character's soul, the characters must defeat the efreet and then find a way to quench the magical fires of the furnace.  

#### The Great Con (Deceit)

You've always been a grifter, using your wits to trick and manipulate others for your own advantage. But when you unknowingly made a deal with one of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s agents, you learned that even you can be conned. Before you could fulfill the seemingly simple terms of the deal, you were murdered by the Avatar of Bhaal, consigning you to the Nine Hells. On the one hand, you admire the devil's cunning trickery... but on the other, you want payback for how you were played.

- **Character Punishment.** You were once a master of deceit, but in your dreams you're trapped in a labyrinth of your own lies, forced to run through the maze while being hunted by shadowy enemies and never able to find a way out.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Eye Market in the territory of Memnoriac, on Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is pursued by the pit fiend's gang of devils through the very streets Memnoriac designed. The route is littered with illusions and convoluted traps. Deadly spiked pits appear as normal floors or seemingly safe doorways lead into rooms filled with deadly fire. As the soul flees the devils, it constantly "dies," forcing it to begin again. To free this character's soul, the characters must fight their way through the narrow streets, defeating the monsters and avoiding the tricks and traps.  

![The Furnace (Anger) and The Great Con (Deceit)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/018-0.webp#center)

#### The Heartless Master (Oppression)

You were used to the finer things in life; due to your fame and fortune, you surrounded yourself with servants to answer every need and fulfill every desire. You paid them well, but in exchange you demanded flawless perfection. Unbeknownst to you, the head of your household achieved this impossible standard through brutal training and punishments for any servant that failed even the smallest task. Despite your ignorance, you were ultimately responsible for the well-being of those under your charge... a responsibility you blissfully abdicated.

- **Character Punishment.** Your sins weigh heavily on you. At night, you're plagued by disturbing dreams. In them, you're a servant under control of a cruel master who makes impossible demands. When you inevitably fail at your tasks, you're brutally punished over and over.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Sign of the Hag's Arms, on Malbolge, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is a servant ordered to perform a series of impossible tasks: cleaning out entire stables in a single day; serving a perfectly cooked meal despite a fire that won't stay lit; delivering a message across deadly terrain without weapons or armor. With each failure, the character's overseerâ€”a ruthless hagâ€”subjects the character's soul to a series of brutal tortures to "teach" them the error of their ways. To save their soul, the character must find a way to complete these impossible tasks, then defeat the overseer.  

#### The Infinite Treasure (Greed)

You were never afraid to take what was yoursâ€”or what was anyone else's, for that matter. You lusted after material wealth in all its formsâ€”money, possessions, magic items. During your life, you accumulated a vast hoard of treasures, but you couldn't take it with you when you died. In the end, the only thing your avarice got you was a one-way ticket to the Nine Hells.

- **Character Punishment.** Your dreams are filled with the endless counting of gold coinsâ€”hundreds, thousands, millions, all piled in an enormous chamber. Each one must be counted by hand, and you can't stop until you're done... but the mountain of coins just continues to grow and grow. Worst of all, you know in your heart they aren't even yours; you're just counting them for someone else.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Ineffable Trove, on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is forced to count a massive mountain of gold coins one by one. This task is overseen by a powerful red dragonâ€”the true owner of the coins. At the end of each day, the mountain of coins shifts and topples, crushing the character under the coins' weight. It takes all night for the character to claw their way out, only to begin the count again. To free this character's soul, the characters must defeat the dragon and leave the coins. (Taking even one causes the dragon to come back to life.)  

![The Heartless Master (Oppr...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/019-0.webp#center "The Heartless Master (Oppression) and The Infinite Treasure (Greed)")

#### The Merciless (Harm)

Throughout your adventuring career, your one true love was always with you, fighting by your side. You looked forward to a long and happy life together after your adventuring days were done, but that future was ripped away. Your partner was killed in a surprise attack by servants of an enemy from your past, their body disintegrated so they couldn't be raised. You hunted down the one responsible. But in your grief, it wasn't enough to merely defeat or kill them. You spent days torturing your enemy, making them feel as much pain as possible in the hopes it would soothe your own tormented heart. In the end, it didn't help... but your cruelty was such that upon your death your soul was consigned to the Nine Hells.

- **Character Punishment.** The brutal revenge against your enemies brought you no solace. Instead, it only twisted and corrupted the memories you have of your true love. Now when you sleep, you dream of them not as your companion, but as your sadistic tormentor, torturing you in a prison cell from which there is no escape.  
- **Phylactery Location.** Imprisoned in the mining town at the foot of the Sorrow Mine, on Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is imprisoned by devils with the face and form of their one true love. In the prison, the soul is relentlessly tortured over and over by these doppelgangers. To free this character's soul, the characters must break into the heavily guarded cells, find a way to reveal the true forms of the guards, then defeat them and escape the prison.  

#### The Oathbreaker (Betrayal)

In the early days of your adventuring career, you swore an oath of loyalty to a patron. It was only much later you discovered you served a monster. When you were ordered to slaughter a political rival's children, you refused. Despite your good intentions, you broke your solemn vow to serve, condemning your soul to the Nine Hells on a technicality when the patron's hired assassins killed you.

- **Character Punishment.** Every night, you're haunted by a recurring nightmare in which you're trapped in a room with strange, feral children. They cry and beg for mercy, even as they attack you over and over.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Chasm of Found Things, on Stygia, the fifth layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul is imprisoned in a room filled with polymorphing devils. These creatures alternate between two forms: devils that attack the character's unarmed soul relentlessly and crying children begging for mercy. To free this character's soul, the characters must defeat all the devils before they transform back into children.  

![The Merciless (Harm) and T...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/020-0.webp#center "The Merciless (Harm) and The Oathbreaker (Betrayal)")

#### Patricide (Murder)

You murdered your father. It wasn't premeditated, and you loved your father. But an argument escalated to the point where violence was involved. It was an accident that you will forever regret. Before you could use your considerable influence to have a priest raise him from the dead, you were imprisoned for your crime and then hanged.

- **Character Punishment.** Your dreams are haunted by the screams of your suffering soul. Each dream is the sameâ€”a replay of your fatal argument with your father. Instead of killing your father, he overpowers you and then whips you relentlessly with a spiked belt. You know that you must end this cycle of violence.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The Agora of Floating Knives, on Dis, the second layer of the Nine Hells. The character's soul has been imprisoned in a flesh golem that has the character's face. It is constantly whipped with a spiked belt by a devil bearing the face of the character's father. Both the flesh golem and devil must be defeated to free the character's soul and reclaim it.  

#### The Queen (Jealousy)

Nobody said life was fair... but why was it always unfair against you? You were talented and skilled. You worked hard. But even with all you accomplished, there was always somebody more richly rewarded than you. More fame. More wealth. More attention. An easier life. It left a bitter taste in your mouth; it soured everything you had, diminishing you and your accomplishments. It seemed like the world was always against you. And then you ended up in the Nine Hells, proving death was against you too.

- **Character Punishment.** You have strange dreams not connected to your life. In them, you're a lowly servant... yet somehow your sister is the Queen, and she is beloved. Other servants, guards, diplomats, members of the courtâ€”they all go on and on about how smart she is, how beautiful, how perfect, while you toil in the shadows, forgotten and ignored.  
- **Phylactery Location.** The War-Slough, on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Each day, the character's soul must go from room to room in a castle, clad in soiled rags, and clean the opulent chambers under the watchful eye of the Queen and her followers. They constantly deride and chastise the soul for the poor job they're doing. Often, they abuse the character, beating them with sticks and switches to spur them to work harder. To free their soul, characters must defeat the Queen... but even if she is slain, she simply reappears on her throne, completely unharmed. The only way to truly defeat the Queen is to first destroy her throne.  

![Patricide (Murder) and The Queen (Jealousy)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/021-0.webp#center)

## Group Patrons

Group patrons help player characters work together toward a common goal. They're powerful backers who give adventurers a clear purpose. They also provide rare resources such as magic items, contacts, and other hard to find things.

This section describes three group patrons. Characters in search of a good-aligned patron should choose the Hellriders of Elturel, while those who prefer a neutral patron should choose the Conclave of Halruaa. Evil characters may be drawn to the third patron option, the Deathstalkers of Bhaal.

Group patrons have the following facets:

- **Quest.** Each group patron has an overarching goal that its members seek to accomplish by giving the characters a quest, which you'll find in the patron's description. As they pursue this quest, characters might receive other missions from their primary contact in their group patron.  
- **Perks.** Group patrons offer access to resources not readily available to most people. These include magical equipment, secret information, and training. Each group patron gives a different set of perks. Most group patrons also give access to magic items for purchase or recipes on how to craft them.  
- **Contacts.** Each group patron has one or two primary contacts that interact with the player characters.  

> [!note] Resolving Group Patron Objectives
> 
> The characters can stay in contact with their group patron throughout the adventure. Once the characters complete the quest given to them by their group patron, they'll have a final meeting with their group patron's representative in Cania. See "A Thankful Patron" in chapter 10 for details.

## Hellriders of Elturel

- **Alignment.** Good  

The Hellriders are an elite cavalry unit whose members act as the primary armed force of the city of Elturel. They're one of the most renowned and well-regarded military forces in the Realms. It is said that a company of Hellriders once rode into Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells, and from this story, the Hellriders were named.

This story is true, for a century ago a gateway to the Nine Hells opened in the Fields of the Dead north of the city of Elturel. The skilled knights of Elturel fought a losing battle against the Fiends that poured from this gate. The High Rider of Elturel implored his people to pray to the gods for help. Their prayers were answered when the angel [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md) arrived in Elturel with a small host of allies. She rallied and trained an army of thousands and then led them into the gateway to the Nine Hells. While she was successful at destroying the gate, [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md) herself was captured by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and corrupted into the archdevil who now rules over Avernus. The knights of Elturel were renamed to the Hellriders in dedication to [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md) and the warriors who followed her into the Nine Hells.

The Hellriders have learned that some of [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md)'s allies are still alive in the Nine Hells. They remain uncorrupted but suffer horrific tortures. The Hellriders feel duty bound to rescue them.

### Hellrider Quest

The Hellriders know the location of Celestial beings who are trapped within the Nine Hells. If rescued, these beings grant the characters powers that should help them in their own personal quests:

- **Anagwendol.** She is kept prisoner in Phlegethos at the Elemental Preserve.  
- **Barachiel.** He is a prisoner of the Brothers Adramlech and Morax and can be found on their infernal warship prowling the River Styx.  
- **Jenevere.** She is kept prisoner in Maladomini at the Eye Market.  

Each time the characters rescue one of these Celestial beings, the being bestows a supernatural gift as a reward. Each character may choose one of the charms described in the "Supernatural Gifts" section of the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

### Hellrider Perks

If the characters choose the Hellriders as their group patron, each receives the following benefits.

#### Hellrider's Blessing

The Hellriders know better than most the evils found in the Nine Hells and would never send anyone there without protection. After spending the entirety of a long rest in the Nine Hells, you gain the benefit of a [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell.

#### Celestial Cavalry

While much of the journey through the Nine Hells follows the River Styx, it is likely that you will occasionally leave on excursions or scouting missions. While you remain in the Nine Hells, you may cast the [Phantom Steed](Mechanics/spells/phantom-steed.md) spell at will, as a ritual.

#### Hellrider's Salvation

You're taught a ritual to help save missing Celestials. The ritual requires 1 minute to complete and targets all Celestials within 100 feet. Once the ritual is complete, if the Celestial is willing, they're transported to a location on the Material Plane of their choosing.

### Hellrider Contact: Ramius

![Ramius Dangremond](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/023-0.webp#center)

[Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) Dangremond is the commander of the Hellriders of Elturel. He never wanted the position, but because of the many deaths within the ranks of the order, he had to step up. His friend and fellow Hellrider, [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md), was the main reason he was able to grow into a capable commander. The loss of his friend saddens [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md), and the news of his imprisonment within the Nine Hells gnaws at his soul.

[Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) is a natural horseman and a gifted athlete. The soldiers he leads often say that there isn't anything that [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) can't mount or ride. He's ridden horses, mammoths, and machines into battle. Loyalty, honor, and duty are virtues that [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) upholds. He fears nothing other than losing those he cares for.

#### Ramius as a Contact

[Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) doesn't have the personal ability to cast [Plane Shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md)â€”instead, he has been given a magic item that allows him to visit with the party every few days. When he arrives, he brings general supplies such as food and water, and treats any wounds, curses, or diseases the party has (to the best of his ability). Afterwards, he offers a selection of useful magic items for purchase, or, if the party already has excess magic items, he offers to purchase them for keeping or disposal.

- **Alignment.** Neutral  

Halruaa is a land of magic, renowned for the fact that a significant portion of its ruling elite are archmages. Created by archwizards foreseeing the fall of Netheril, Halruaa combines peace and harmony with the magic powers of their ancestors, but without the taint of their ambitions.

The Conclave is a secret society within Halruaa that enforces the laws regarding the use, abuse, and research of magic in Halruaa.

The membership of the Conclave is a mystery to everyone outside their ranks. Others within Halruaa know of the Conclave's existence, but not the identities of its members.

Whenever the experiments, practices, or other actions of a spellcaster endanger the future of Halruaa, the Conclave intervenes. This intervention is usually a warning, but a spellcaster who ignores the warning is eliminated or simply made to disappear.

The Conclave has become interested in the events put into motion by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) because their diviners have foreseen that the archdevil's scheme will result in a dangerous soul being unleashed.

### Conclave Quest

The Conclave wants the characters to track down a soul they refer to as the Unmaker. They're to use a ritual to destroy the soul. To help with this task and with finding the other souls that the characters seek, the Conclave offers to use their diviners to uncover the location of powerful magic items. The Nine Hells is the graveyard for thousands of heroes and the magic items that they brought with them. Some of these include the most famed items in the multiverse.

The Unmaker is a prisoner of the archdevil [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) and can be found on his infernal submersible. The Conclave provides a Conclave Coin, effectively a special Soul Coin that can contain the soul of the Unmaker. The characters must slay the Unmaker, trap the Unmaker's soul in the coin, and return the coin to the Conclave so it and the soul inside it can be destroyed.

Each character is told the location of a powerful magic item. This magic item is based off the class in which they have the highest level:

- **Artificer.** The [Manual of Golems (iron)](Mechanics/items/manual-of-iron-golems.md), which can be found in Stygia at the Chasm of Found Things.  
- **Barbarian.** [Belt of Giant Strength (storm)](Mechanics/items/belt-of-storm-giant-strength.md), which can be found in Minauros at the Ineffable Trove.  
- **Bard.** [Instrument of the Bards (Ollamh Harp)](Mechanics/items/instrument-of-the-bards-ollamh-harp.md), which can be found in Dis at the Agora of Floating Knives.  
- **Cleric.** [Rod of Resurrection](Mechanics/items/rod-of-resurrection.md), which can be found in Stygia at the Chasm of Found Things.  
- **Druid.** [Staff of the Woodlands](Mechanics/items/staff-of-the-woodlands.md), which can be found in Maladomini at the Eye Market  
- **Fighter.** [Belt of Giant Strength (storm)](Mechanics/items/belt-of-storm-giant-strength.md) which can be found in Minauros at the Ineffable Trove.  
- **Monk/Rogue.** [Cloak of Invisibility](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-invisibility.md), which can be found in Dis at the Agora of Floating Knives.  
- **Paladin.** [Holy Avenger](Mechanics/items/holy-avenger.md), which can be found in Stygia at the Chasm of Found Things.  
- **Ranger.** [Iron Horn of Valhalla](Mechanics/items/horn-of-valhalla-iron.md), which can be found in Dis at the Agora of Floating Knives.  
- **Sorcerer/Warlock/Wizard.** [Staff of the Magi](Mechanics/items/staff-of-the-magi.md), which can be found in Cania at the Sorrow Mine.  

### Conclave Perks

If the characters choose the Conclave as their group patron, each receives the following benefits.

#### Arcane Communication

The Conclave of Halruaa gives you a Sending Stone and a Halruaan Ethereal Vessel. The Sending Stone can be used to communicate with a member of the Conclave who has the matching stone.

The Halruaan Ethereal Vessel is a magic item that allows two people to attune to it. You and a member of the Conclave are attuned to the vessel. The vessel is a transparent case that can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). When not in use, it exists on the Ethereal Plane. While the vessel remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and recall it (as can the Conclave member also attuned to it). It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You send the vessel back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action.

#### Arcane Quartermasters

The Conclave has amassed a collection of useful magic items and material spell components. You can use your Sending Stone to request one of the items on the Conclave Items table. You must then pay the cost of the item, placing the payment in your Halruaan Ethereal Vessel and returning the vessel to the Ethereal Plane. The money is then removed by the Conclave member attuned to the vessel and replaced with the requested item, which you can then retrieve from the vessel.

### Halruaan Contact: Zythan Avhoste

![Zythan Avhoste](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/027-0.webp#center)

[Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md), like many other Halruaans, spent his early years studying the arcane arts. His talent in Divination magic made him particularly useful to the Conclave, and they quickly sought him out. Under their tutelage, his skill flourished, and he became a powerful mage. Those that know him personally recount his matter-of-fact personality, his green hair, and his third eye that seems to open when he performs magic. He rarely speaks of himself, however, choosing instead to focus his attention on the future.

When he first received an official position within the Conclave, [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) wanted to prove himself. He spent countless hours peering into the future and examining potential outcomes. One fateful night, he just barely caught sight of a forbidden ritual being preparedâ€”a ritual that could cost the lives of many Halruaans. Because of his sight, the Conclave was able to intervene in time, and he was quickly promoted and showered with praise.

For the past few months, [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) has felt like something was off: at first, he suspected another ritual within Halruaa. He requisitioned the help of the other diviners, as well as a powerful Crystal Ball, and together they were able to piece together a vision. The dark lord of the Nine Hells, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), will unleash a great evil very soon. Though the Conclave often stays out of non-Halruaan affairs, they had no choice but to act. It is for this reason that the adventurers were called to Halruaa.

[Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md)'s (see the accompanying stat block) skill in arcane magic, while particularly focused on Divination, extends to every school. While he lacks proficiency in martial combat, he can wield both offensive and defensive magic effectively. Outside of his magical talent, he is also known to be highly intelligent, though his social skills could use work. Much of his time is spent viewing alternate futures and preparing for potential dangers, leaving little for himself. He often goes without meals until he starts to feel weak, and if he had friends, they might be concerned about how much time he spends working.

#### Zythan as a Contact

Using his Divination magic, [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) keeps tabs on the party, occasionally checking in when he deems appropriate. When he checks in, he can provide access to some magic items. He will also purchase any excess Spell Scrolls or spellbooks found by the party, and can, upon request, attempt to hunt down specific magic items. If successful, he brings the desired magic items on his next visit.

## Deathstalkers of Bhaal

- **Alignment.** Evil  

Bhaal, also known as the Lord of Murder, is the god of assassins, killers, and murder.

During the Time of Troubles, most gods, including Bhaal, were forced to walk the world as mortals and lost all their godly powers. During this period, Bhaal was slain by the then-mortal Cyric. Bhaal, having foreseen his own death, sired many children, each of whom carried a piece of his divine essence within them. These children are referred to as the children of Bhaal, or Bhaalspawn, and were created to ensure Bhaal's resurrection. This did not come to pass until more than a century after the Time of Troubles. Even though Bhaal was reborn, he was a shadow of his former self and tied to the Material Plane.

During the time that he was dead, Bhaal had many scattered cults, the most infamous being the Deathstalkers of Bhaal, who were dedicated to bringing him back to life. With Bhaal now returned, the Deathstalkers are now focused on finding a way to return Bhaal to being a fully divine being. They've discovered a way by making a deal with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). However, they believe the Lord of the Nine Hells intends to deceive them and now they seek a way to make sure [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) holds up to his end of the bargain.

> [!note] Uncomfortable Allies
> 
> The Deathstalkers of Bhaal are responsible for the murders that doomed the characters (or their loved ones) to the Nine Hells. The characters don't have much reason to want anything to do with them let alone align themselves with these murderers. However, the Deathstalkers are a powerful ally. Having begun to doubt their alliance with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), they now attempt to gain the cooperation of the characters. [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md), the Deathstalker that contacts the heroes, is quite convincing. And scary...
^uncomfortable-allies

### Deathstalker Quest

To force [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to make good on his word, the Deathstalkers of Bhaal want to gain leverage. For this they need a powerful artifact. They ask the characters to steal some of the most infamous and powerful artifacts of the Nine Hells. They need only one, leaving any other artifacts for the characters to decide what to do with. For a detailed description of these artifacts, see the section "Infernal Artifacts" in appendix D.

### Deathstalker Perks

If the characters choose the Deathstalkers as their group patron, each receives the following benefits.

#### Death Token

Each member of your party is given a Token of Bhaal. For its magic to work, the token must be in your possession. The first time you fail a death saving throw that doesn't kill you outright, the token magically transports you, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, to a demiplane that resembles an empty chamber with no exits. Any ally within 30 feet of you is also transported to the demiplane, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, if the ally has 0 hit points and is either stable or dying when the token activates. Each creature that appears in the demiplane regains 10 hit points. Any creature that starts its turn in the demiplane is transported back to the space it left, or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space. The token can be used only once, after which it turns to dust.

#### Deathstalker's Blessing

Your party receives the blessing of Bhaal. This manifests by making you deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat yet. In addition, any creature that hasn't taken a turn in combat has disadvantage on saving throws against your spells. The blessing applies only while in the Nine Hells.

#### Soul Coin Market

Much like the archdevils of the Nine Hells, Bhaal desires souls. Specifically, he desires Soul Coins (see "[Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md)" in appendix D). When you're in possession of one or more Soul Coins, you can whisper to the coin what it is that you desire from the Deathstalker Items table. If you have the requisite number of coins, the Soul Coins vanish from your possession, and the item that you asked for appears within 5 feet of you.

### Deathstalker Contact: Sarevok

![Sarevok Anchev](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/031-0.webp#center)

[Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) Anchev is a powerful Deathstalker. He is also one of the Bhaalspawn, the mortal offspring of the dead god Bhaal. [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) attempted to reclaim the divine seat of the Lord of Murder vacated by his immortal father's demise, but his plans were thwarted when he was slain by his half-brother, Abdel Adrian, who rejected his heritage and fought against his Bhaalspawn siblings.

[Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md)'s spirit was sent to the Abyss as punishment. There he eventually crossed paths with Abdel a second time when his noble-hearted brother ventured into the lower realms on a dangerous quest to stop another Bhaalspawn named Melissan. [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) agreed to help Abdel kill Melissan, on the condition that Abdel helped him escape the eternal torments of the Abyss.

Abdel agreed, and [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) was reborn into the mortal world. After his rebirth, [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) was true to his word, and the two brothers fought side by side against their half-sister. Ultimately Melissan was defeated, and [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) was granted a second chance at life.

With his prodigious strength, his legendary skill in battle, and the Sword of Chaosâ€”a life-stealing, enchanted bladeâ€”[Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) became a famous (and feared) mercenary. Yet his many accomplishments brought him no joy. He felt no thrill at victory in battle, no delight in the routing of his enemies. The power he accumulated was bitter as ashes on his tongue, and he became a man haunted by his former life. The realization that no earthly achievements could ever compare to what he once almost hadâ€”immortality and godhoodâ€”left him broken and empty.

[Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) plunged into a deep despair. To numb his pain, he indulged in every vice imaginable, squandering his wealth and health on alcohol, drugs, and fleeting comforts. While his divine heritage slowed his aging, it did not stop it entirely, and after decades of self-abuse he was eventually reduced to an old man begging in the streets of Baldur's Gate.

This was how his fatherâ€”Bhaal, the reborn god of murderâ€”found him. Bhaal recognized his own divine spark in the pathetic old man, and he sensed [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) still had potential. Bhaal recruited him to become the high priest of his fledgling clergy, giving [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) new purpose... and another chance to become an agent of death and destruction.

#### Sarevok as a Contact

Though he lacks Divination magic, [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) keeps tabs on the party's progress and checks in whenever he feels like it. During his check-ins, he will offer a small assortment of magic items, as well as a large variety of potions. He also has a vast treasury and is willing to purchase Soul Coins for 1,000 gp per coin. In addition, for the price of 10,000 gp, he grants one character a blessing (see "Supernatural Gifts" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide") that allows them to become a host for his god, Bhaal.

##### Unholy Blessing of Bhaal

You may use an action to transform yourself into the Slayer. This works exactly as the [Polymorph](Mechanics/spells/polymorph.md) spell, except the form chosen uses the accompanying Slayer stat block. After you use this blessing, you can't use it again until you have finished a long rest.
