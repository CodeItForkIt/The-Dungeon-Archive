[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), through his many travels along the River Styx, has tried to learn as much as possible about the Nine Hells.

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) considers a couple of the maps that have fallen into his possession more worthy of trust. These he has annotated himself with quick descriptions of important locations.
