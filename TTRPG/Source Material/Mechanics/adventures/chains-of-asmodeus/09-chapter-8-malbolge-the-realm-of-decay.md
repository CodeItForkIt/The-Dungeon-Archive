# Chapter 8: Malbolge, the Realm of Decay
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 135* 

![The Sign of the Hag's Arms...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/134-0.webp#center "The Sign of the Hag's Arms offers little respite to weary travelers from outside the Nine Hells.")

Practically infinite mountain slopes and falling boulders make up Malbolge, the sixth layer of the Nine Hells. It was once ruled by Malagard, the Hag Countess, who has since been replaced by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s daughter [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md). Prior to her rule, the layer was almost entirely stone, with very little distinguishing features. However, due to a curse placed upon Malagard, her body grew to a grotesque size and imploded when [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) took over. Now Malbolge is decorated with pieces of her corpse, a marriage between a rotting carcass and a cliff-face. What little pockets of devil civilization remain do so in caves carved from the mountain or inside fortresses supported by indestructible pillars.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Malbolge Overview" section. It provides you with everything you need to guide your players across this bloated and decaying landscape. Use the information provided to set the scene during their travels through Malbolge.

### Encounters

The denizens of Malbolge are divided in their loyalties but united in their fear and disarray over the changed landscape. If the characters are wandering far and wide, roll on the Random Encounters in Malbolge table to determine what they might encounter.

**Random Encounters in Malbolge**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-malbolge-the-realm-of-decay.md#^random-encounters-in-malbolge)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | There is a terrible shaking as the earth nearby splits apart and a broad-faced beast, as large as a dragon but wingless, erupts, a mouthful of rocks and gems falling from its mouth. It is a [miasmorne](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/miasmorne-coa.md) (see appendix B) burrowing through the Nine Hells, in search of metal and magic to devour. |
| 2 | Inside a small, fortified structure is a [corruption devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/corruption-devil-paeliryon-coa.md) (see appendix B). It hates [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md)'s rule and believes it can revive the Hag Countess. |
| 3 | A [maelephant nomad](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md) (see appendix B), driven slightly insane by its extended lifespan, searches the ruins for something to guard. When it sees the characters, there is a 50 percent chance it goes into a frenzy and attacks. |
| 4 | A patrol of six [erinyes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) search for any remaining influence from the Hag Countess. They reward anyone with information relevant to their search with 2,500 gp, and attack hags and their allies on sight. |
| 5 | An [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) [orthon](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/orthon-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) has been stalking the characters for some time. There is a 75 percent chance it attacks them now. Otherwise, it moves on, searching for its quarry. |
| 6 | Massive tremors shake the earth, causing an avalanche of rocks to plummet down. Each creature in the path of the rocks must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 35 (`10d6`) bludgeoning damage. |

### Locations

The characters must seek out The Sign of the Hag's Arms, an inn and tavern, but no safe haven for mortals. There they may discover some of what they seek. The "Key Locations in Malbolge" section provides additional details about other locations in this layer.

### Koh Tam

Ensure that [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is urgent in directing the characters to The Sign of the Hag's Arms. He can also provide useful information about some of the other locations herein, though he doesn't believe what the characters seek can be found anywhere other than the inn.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your player's objectives and lead them to the corresponding areas to ensure they can complete their goals.

These objectives can be attained in Malbolge:

**Objectives in Malbolge**

| Objective | Location |

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Malbolge. You can of course have them encounter more if you want. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

## Malbolge Overview

Malbolge is considered the most dangerous stretch of the River Styx. Due to rockslides and erosion, boulders and rock formations sit within the river, changing in shape and location each day. Parts of the river mix with acid and blood from Malagard's remains, creating a toxic soup that dissolves the hulls of unprepared boats and devours anything thrown overboard in seconds. Should a captain survive all these hazards, they must navigate through a claustrophobic canyon with steep walls, where the incline eventually levels out and empties into Maladomini.

The surface of Malbolge is nightmarishâ€”an already treacherous landscape is made more dangerous by the remains of the hag queen. Throughout the layer exist forests where the trees resemble hairs of a gargantuan beast, and caustic lakes of strange substances. Her sometimes-slippery sometimes-sticky blood covers large swathes of Malbolge. Massive bones, some shattered and some intact, create artificial structures across the land, with pieces of teeth and cartilage sticking out like grotesque obelisks.

Hoping to survive the trials of the layer more easily, devils constructed an intricate labyrinth of tunnels connecting the cities together. Much of the realm's inhabitants navigate the tunnels, expanding and creating new pathways and connections. Some believe [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) plans to construct entire cities underground, though such plans would take centuries to complete.

Before the Hag Countess ruled, Moloch claimed ownership of the realm. When [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) grew tired of his tricks, he appointed Malagard, and in so doing cursed her with an insatiable hunger. She ate devils and the souls of the damned; her body grew over decades, but her position as Malbolge's ruler kept her alive. When [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) was appointed ruler of Malbolge, the blessing expired, and Malagard's mountainous bulk exploded in a shower of flesh and gore that covered much of the layer. Many of the hags that called Malbolge home left, leaving [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md)'s subjects small in number.

### Leaving Malbolge

Like Avernus, Malbolge contains a few exits to the layer below, though none are easy. While the Styx is an option, only the most experienced captains can navigate the dangerous rapids. Devils native to the layer claim the labyrinth of tunnels has a passage leading to Maladomini, though without a guide such a passage would be difficult to traverse. Even so, with the dangers of the Styx, many opt for the caverns.

### Features

The remains of the Hag Countess poison the entire layer, including visitors. Good-aligned creatures have vulnerability to poison damage while in Malbolge, even if they would normally have resistance or immunity. Non-good creatures have their resistance and immunity removed, but don't suffer vulnerability.

In addition to the poisoned air of the layer, creatures also feel drained the longer they stay in the realm. Each time a creature that isn't a Celestial or Fiend finishes a long rest, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they have disadvantage on all saving throws until they leave Malbolge.

## Key Locations in Malbolge

While the characters are making their way to The Sign of the Hag's Arms, they may want to take a small detour through the other locations found in Malbolge.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/137-0.webp#gallery)

### Ossiea

Above ground, a few locations were built upon the grotesque remnants of Malagard's body, the parts that survived the cataclysm. These pieces of her enormous, bloated body are still relatively intact and serve as gruesome landmarks. Among these, the characters may choose to visit Ossiea. This fortress is found near the Hair Forest and built into the skull of Malagard, her empty unseeing eye sockets covered by tall sheets of red glass. Ossiea is the capital of the realm and current home of [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) and her subordinates. [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) is obsessed with beauty, and the city around her reflects this. The shops the characters visit here are stacked with magical cosmetics, intricate jewelry, and beautiful garments.

> [!note] Temptation of Pride
> 
> ***"A Thing of Beauty"***
> 
> Whilst rummaging the stalls around the city, the character with the lowest Charisma is approached by a devil who offers to sell them an amulet of great power for 600 gp. This is an Amulet of Appearance (see appendix D) and if the character initially declines the purchase, the charming devil insists the character tries it on before deciding. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check reveals it to be a magic amulet but not that it is cursed. If the character tries the amulet on, they transform. Any blemishes and imperfections vanish, they've never looked better. Audible gasps of approval can be heard from onlookers who see the transformation take place.
^temptation-of-pride

### Maggoth Thyg

Near the bottom of the layer also lies Maggoth Thyg, a mysterious cavern from which no creature ever returns. Even the devils native to Malbolge fear Maggoth Thyg, claiming it has existed far longer than the Nine Hells. The characters should know to be wary of a location that even the denizens of the Nine Hells are fearful of.

> [!note] Random Temptations
> 
> If the characters decide to go in search of Maggoth Thyg despite the obvious perils, have them venture for four hours towards a cavern system at the bottom of Malbolge. When they get close to the area where they expect to find the cave, the ground is scattered with corpses. If they insist on venturing at least another hour further, roll on the Random Temptations table from chapter 2.
^random-temptations

### The Sign of the Hag's Arms

Another landmark utilizing Malagard's remains in its construction is the Sign of the Hag's Arms. This multi-leveled structure rises out from the ground near a place where many tunnels and thoroughfares cross paths. One of the hag's dismembered arms serves as a gruesome marker for this location, which [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) deems the most likely to house what the characters seek.

## Adventure: The Sign of the Hag's Arms

The Hag's Arms is run by hags, of course, the entrepreneurs of the lower planes. There are three of them, as is traditional, each with her own specialty, each a powerful magician beyond the regular dreams of her kind. Irabella runs the inn and kitchen, the night hag Malacki tinkers on hideous creations in her underground workshops, and [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) the Angelmaker is the coven's undisputed leader.

When the characters first enter Malbolge, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) or [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) impart the following knowledge about the layer to them:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) explains the windswept and endless slopes of this new layer of the Nine Hells, "In Malbolge there is no level ground, but always the strength-sapping slog of up or down, and the going is riven with crevasses and the colossal, eternal remains of Malagard, the former ruler of this layer, constantly festering but never decaying away."
> 
> "There are tunnels, lairs for such fauna as calls Malbolge home: the insects and spiders with their kin, in swarms and of huge size. Some say they were spawned from the corruption of Malagard's vast fleshy diaspora. The things have adapted their natural weapons and strategy to prey on fiends, though they will take mortals gladly."
> 
> He toes a clump of profane soil, releasing numerous scuttling insects that flee into the dirt below and then continues, "But those, devil, or mortal, who lament the cheerless character of the plane should dampen their enthusiasm when the Sign of the Hag's Arms comes into sight. Hospitality is to be had there, it's true, but not every guest who enters its doors has the luxury of checking out again."
^21b

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s advice to the characters is as follows:

- They should visit The Sign of the Hag's Arms, where they might start looking for answers. But he warns them: the hags are powerful adversaries.  
- They should avoid going to Maggoth Thyg, he has heard many stories about those caves and none of them ended well.  

### The Sign of the Hag's Arms Locations

Some of the major locations found in and around the inn are described below.

> [!gallery]
> ![The Sign of the Hag's Arms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/139-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/139-0.webp#gallery)

#### S1: The Swarm

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You stand upon the lower slopes of a great uprising of earth. A well-worn path curves upwards but a fetid mist hangs low, allowing only the murky outline of a building crouching upon the hilltop above. Closer to you there appear to be numerous, less-worn paths, leading into various crevices and small canyons.
^21f

The inn sits at a confluence of chasm and tunnel thoroughfares between infernal fortresses, in a particularly perilous region of the plane. Perilous more for Fiends than for travelers from outside the lower planes. From long feeding on the toxic flesh of Malagardâ€”perhaps helped along by the tinkering of the inn's proprietorsâ€”the local life has developed some potent weapons to deploy against devils. In place of the regular poisons that Fiends are immune to, many species of [giant scorpions](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md) and [giant spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) inject acid with their stingers and fangs, or even more bizarre fluids that sear like the radiant touch of angels, rendering down fiendish flesh into a readily ingestible soup.

The tumultuous air above isn't safe either, as flights of [ayperobo swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ayperobo-swarm-coa.md) (see appendix B) issue from their crevice nests, eager to devour prey. Those devils tasked to take messages and goods through the region of the inn always hurry to take shelter there, no matter the risks, and mortal travelers would be advised to do the same.

##### Ekengarik's Swarms

Approaching travelers are set upon by `2d6` [giant scorpions](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md) and `2d6` [giant spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) that crawl out from the various crevices around them. If the characters take to the air, an [ayperobo swarm](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/ayperobo-swarm-coa.md) (see appendix B) joins the battle. The insects don't pursue if the characters climb the hill towards the inn.

> [!note] Corrupted Insects
> 
> Any giant insects encountered in Malbolge deal acid damage instead of poison damage and each of their attacks deals an additional 4 (`1d8`) radiant damage. These insects also have resistance to acid, poison, and fire damage.
^corrupted-insects

#### S2: Ekengarik's Hive

![Ekengarik's deadly swarms ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/140-0.webp#center "Ekengarik's deadly swarms chase travelers to the inn.")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You notice numerous gashes on stone outcroppings, crevices, and the ground itself, that apparently form the entrance to tunnels, leading into a darkness below. Peering into an opening, you see a network of tunnels and chambers illuminated by a soft, pulsing glow and hear the faint sound of scraping and digging. The tunnels are lined with hardened earth, and seemingly form a complex labyrinthine network. The air is thick and humid, carrying the scent of dirt and decay.
^223

##### Ekengarik's Duty

Malecki provides [Ekengarik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ekengarik-coa.md) with ever more noxious underlings to serve her hive, and she in turn ensures that travelers in the locale are 'encouraged' to visit the inn, and those trying to escape without paying their due meet a sorry end. It was [Ekengarik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ekengarik-coa.md) that sent the swarm of insects towards the characters earlier. [Ekengarik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ekengarik-coa.md) (see accompanying stat block) wants to drive the characters to the inn, but her patience is limited. Keep track of this by using a counter. The counter starts at 1 if the giant insects have been slain, zero otherwise, and for each hour the characters spend in the hive, and each time a fiendish formian is slain, it increases by +1. Once this counter reaches 6, [Ekengarik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ekengarik-coa.md) uses Dimension Door and attacks, generally starting battle with Prismatic Wall to separate the characters from going deeper into her hive. If at any point the characters retreat, she allows them.

##### Treasure

Most corridors in the hive are 5 feet wide, 10 feet tall, and extend in stretches for 50-90 feet before turning sharply. A variety of stones, wooden debris, and various items collected over the years, has been partly cemented into the tunnel walls. As long as the hive isn't disturbed, characters may search for treasure in the hive. For each hour spent searching roll a `d10`. If the result is 10, `1d4` [fiendish formians](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/fiendish-formian-coa.md) (see accompanying stat block) attack, the hive is considered disturbed, and no more treasure can be acquired here. Otherwise, the characters find `2d4 x 100` gp and `1d4` uncommon magic items from the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

##### Phylactery of the Mentor

If one of the characters has ventured into the Nine Hells to find the soul of their mentor, their attention is caught by an imp constrained at the outer edges of [Ekengarik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ekengarik-coa.md)'s hive. This area is less heavily populated with the swarming creatures and the characters can try and sneak closer. The imp is the prisoner of a [fiendish formian](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/fiendish-formian-coa.md) taskmaster. Over and over again his energy is painfully sucked out of him to sustain the taskmaster that controls him. Once the imp collapses in exhaustion the taskmaster moves away, coming back for more once he needs sustenance again. The imp is in truth the character's old mentor transformed to undergo this torment. To rescue them the character has to defeat the formian that is treating their old master as a snack. Preferably without alerting the entire hive. If the characters take more than four rounds to slay the taskmaster another `1d4` [fiendish formians](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/fiendish-formian-coa.md) join the fray.

Once the characters have killed the formians read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The imp hangs limply in his chains, overcome with exhaustion. As you approach it, the imp's body starts to shake violently. As abruptly as the spasms started, they stop. The body sags, seemingly the imp has died. After a few seconds its flesh begins to bubble and evaporate, leaving a phylactery behind.
^227

The character has taken possession of the phylactery of the mentor and gains the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

### Aboveground Inn Locations

Having survived the perilous journey through the Hive's territory, the characters arrive at the relative safety of the inn.

#### S3: Entrance

Read the following as the characters approach the inn.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Sign of the Hag's Arms is well, if bleakly, named. The outer courtyard sits in the crook of one of Malagard's lesser limbs, or at least a recognizable fragment of the same. Within this elbow space the upper level of the inn itself is made entirely from the ancient hag's substance, bones as scaffolding, leathery skin stretched out as a vaned roof, the walls built of tessellated teeth and ragged plates of nails. As a feat of architecture, it is simultaneously impressive and nauseating.
^22a

Had the plane's current ruler, [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md), any respect for her predecessor then doubtless the construction would be counted as deep disrespect. [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) isn't sentimental, however, and Malbolge offers little else in respect of building material. Even the iron of the infernal fortresses must be hauled in from more productive layers. As with most locations in Malbolge, the inn continues on many levels under the ground. There are always guest rooms to be had, for a price. The proprietors accept a variety of currencies. [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md), most commonly, but also magic objects or rare ingredients, given the work all three tend to. Devils passing this way know to bring appropriate recompense for the shelter, but mortals may be dismayed to find that all their gold and gems buy them nothing. However, there are always other options for those visiting from other planes. Not necessarily palatable options.

The characters can purchase lodgings for 1 Soul Coin or an uncommon magic item. Then they're taken to their rooms (see area S6).

#### S4: Feasting Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You aren't certain what the staircase is made of. Every part of the inn seems suspiciously biological in nature, though very dead, and there is an inescapable scent of decay underlying the air. At the top of the staircase lies a long hallway with many doors, the first pair of which are open. Through them you see a great feasting hall with a host of long tables covered in heaps of food. Most of it seems to be meat. There is a cacophonous swarm of devils around the tables, gorging themselves on the strange offerings and shrieking and screaming at each other.
^22c

> [!note] Temptation of Oppression
> 
> ***"Painful Knowledge"***
> 
> If the characters decide to rent a room at the inn or find themselves exploring the guest rooms without payment, they find a mirror by the side of the bed. The mirror is a Sage's Mirror (see appendix D) and is small enough to carry.
^temptation-of-oppression

A great feasting hall is found on the first level of the inn, usually hosting at least a score of devils at any given time. They jostle elbows at tables scrimshawed from Malagard's bones and eat from a unique menu. The flesh of Malagard is generally unpalatable even to Fiends, but the inn's proprietors have the knack of transforming it into a delicacy worth the journeyâ€”to a devil. Mortals are advised to bring their own lunches unless they have a cast iron immunity to poisons.

The hags are always on the lookout for new business associates, or spare parts for their creations. If at any point the characters want to speak to the owner of the inn, they can ask any of the kobold serving staff. The kobold explains who the three hags are and that they often remain in their workshops in the basement. If the characters ask to speak to the hags directly, the servant leaves to fetch them. Roll on the Dealing with Hags table to determine the result of the request. If the character provides a bribe or incentive to encourage the hag to meet, then add +2 to the roll.

**Dealing with Hags**

| d12 + <span title='default=0, max=2, min=0'>[+2 if the characters provide a bribe or incentive]</span> | Result |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1â€“2 | A kobold servant carries a silver tray with the head of the previous servant on it. The characters are asked to leave the inn. |
| 3â€“6 | The kobold returns and says the hags have declined, but the characters are welcome to meet with them in the basement. The magically locked door at S7, will be open. |
| 7â€“9 | Malecki arrives an hour later in the form of an elf woman and sits down at the character's table. She intends to trick the characters. |
| 10â€“11 | Malecki dematerializes from the Ethereal Plane and appears at the character's table, in her true form, willing to make a deal. |
| 12+ | [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) emerges from the basement, her wings partly unfurled as she stalks across the floorboards. The feasting hall quiets, many of the devils suddenly staring into their cups, averting their eyes. She stops and looms over the character's table. |
^dealing-with-hags

#### S5: Kitchens

The [kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) who staff the inn are routinely maimed, killed by accident, tortured, and even eaten by their employers, especially Irabella. They're very aware that they're the weakest things in all the Nine Hells, more wretched even than lemures, and while nothing keeps them safe from the hags, Irabella takes exception to any guests who take liberties with the staff. Working for her is miserable but better than being cast to the mercies of the Nine Hells. The most potent, sorcerous, and wicked among them ascend to the heady rank of chef and become Irabella's chief hench creatures, petty kitchen tyrants among their own kind.

##### Phylactery of the Heartless Master

A character searching for the soul of the heartless master finds it in the body of a bullied kobold. Upon glancing around the kitchens the characters notice a wretched looking kobold bent over a stove. It is frantically trying to light it, but the stove remains cold. The kobold is clearly agitated and terrified. The character seeking this phylactery senses they must help this kobold.

The creature explains to the character that it is being tormented by a ruthless [sea hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md). Every day it is tasked with preparing a feast for her, but whatever it tries it is never good enough, and the day ends with the hag inflicting unspeakable punishment on the kobold until it begs for the release of death. But that release never comes. It always awakens again in the kitchens with a fire that won't light and a list of dishes it doesn't know how to prepare.

If the character looks at the names of the dishes, they recognize some of the delicacies that were on offer in Aelvette's kitchens in Dis. The hag desires a meal of candied spider eggs, roasted jackalwere, and boiled shank of minotaur. She arrives once the meal is prepared to sample the dishes.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence check accurately identifies the ingredients. If the characters spent any time in Aelvette's kitchen they have advantage on the roll. They need to search the storage room for the ingredients. `1d6` hours of searching per recipe is needed to supply them with what they need. Once they get cooking the oven continually goes out, but a successful DC 12 Dexterity check allows them to keep it lit. If the character has proficiency with cook's utensils, they add their proficiency bonus to the roll. Upon success the character and the kobold have created a feast even the hag can't fault. Frustrated, she flies into a rage and attacks. The character needs to defeat the hag to free their soul. The kobold doesn't come to their aid during the fight. Upon killing the hag, the kobold vanishes. In its place the phylactery of the heartless master is standing.

> [!note] Coven Spellcasting
> 
> The three hags that run the inn form a coven that is much more powerful than what is typical. Their coven shared spellcasting ability is as follows:
> 
^coven-spellcasting

#### S6: Guest Rooms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The guest rooms make up most of the upper levels of the inn. The walls seem to be organic and emanate a discomforting warmth. Unfortunately, the narrow corridors make it almost impossible to avoid contact with them. A putrid smell hangs in the air.
^232

The guest rooms themselves are comfortable enough, if one doesn't contemplate the materials used to furnish them. There are six double bedrooms on each level.

### Basement Levels

Below all of thisâ€”the rooms, the hall, the unspeakable kitchensâ€”are the workshops, for the three old women who run the inn have another business they conduct here. Business that draws infernal patrons from every layer of the Nine Hells.

#### S7: The Basements

The work of the hags, when they aren't playing hostess to select visitors, is in the construction of monsters. The secret lies in the flesh of Malagard, which is infinitely dead yet simultaneously bubbling with corrosive and stinking life. Using carefully selected components harvested from the ancient archdevil, adding in parts, pieces, and rare ingredients collected from across the Nine Hells and beyond, they create new beings with independent existence and will. For, while they lack the divine spark that would permit them to create true life, still the carrion flesh of Malagard holds enough vitality to grant a permanent animation to their stitched-together creations. The secret of how they harness the deceased hag-mother's power is known only to the three of them and represents their last bargaining chip should the powers of the Nine Hells decide their tenure is at an end.

While the basements are sealed off from the rest of the inn, there are no guards when the hags are off dealing with guests. The basements are accessible through an iron door that has Arcane Lock on it. Read the following if the characters decide to investigate:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The basement of the inn is a huge cavern carved from the rock. Arches of bone are built into the walls of the cavern for some unknown purpose. What looks like an angel hangs slackly from hooks on the ceiling; it seems to have been constructed out of the body parts of angels and devils.
^235

This cavern is where the creations that the hags are currently working on are found. The angel doesn't have a spark of life as of yet, but if [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) feels threatened she can awaken her creation. The angel is a [planetar](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) that is considered a lawful evil Construct. It doesn't have its spellcasting feature. If the characters are here peacefully, review the "Services" section, for a description of what the hags might offer the characters, and ask for in return.

#### S8: Irabella's Workshops

> A curious splash draws your attention to an area of the basement dotted with large pools of brackish water. Amidst the pools, a green-skinned woman is partly submerged within a large iron-clad bathtub, set upon a wheeled platform. She is leaning out of the tub, studying various body parts arranged on a table before her. The waters of the brackish pools ripple continuously, as if something large moves beneath their surfaces.
^237

Irabella the hag (Irabella uses the [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) stat block, but her creature type is Fey) seldom leaves her great wheeled bath, that is hauled laboriously about the ramps and elevators of the inn by the staff of [kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) she commands. Her workshops are half-submerged, and here she creates aquatic monstrosities on demand. Great Sahuagin priestkings, aboleth archmages and elder kraken all send emissaries to her, and she makes benthic terrors to trouble the dreams of sea gods. She is sharp and bitter in manner, abusive to her servants and needling to her patrons and sisters, but she also commands the day-to-day running of the inn and its kitchens, tedious work the other two have no taste for. Hence her constant barbs are endured.

##### The Pools

Each pool is 150 feet deep and connected to one another. The creature in the pool is a lawful evil [dragon turtle](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-turtle.md) stripped of most of its shell but imbued with infernal energies (Legendary Resistance 2/Day and its Steam Breath deals necrotic damage instead of fire damage). If any pool is disturbed, or Irabella is attacked while in this room, the dragon turtle attacks. During battle, it uses its movement to slip through the tunnels connecting the pools, to position itself tactically, as required.

##### Treasure

Characters find `1d4` [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md), if they search the workshop, though if their pilfering is detected by Irabella, she attacks.

##### Phylactery of the Mother

As soon as the character searching for the phylactery containing their mother's soul enters this room, they hear her voice whisper their name. But her voice sounds like she's trapped under water, and it's distorted. Each hour they may make a DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to try to find her. Only that character can make the check, and no one can help them with it. If they fail the check there is a 1 in 6 chance that Irabella, if not previously encountered, enters the room and confronts them. Once found, the characters are able to retrieve their mother's phylactery from beneath the brackish waters.

The character has taken possession of the phylactery of their mother and gains the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

#### S9: Malecki's Workshops

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Through the gap made between two pillars of bone, you see various large pens, surrounded with walls of bone. A huge beast is chained to the floor in one of the central pens, its head full of tusks and its body a mass of spikes. An elf woman is apparently tending to the creature.
^23c

Malecki, who claims to be the direct descendant of Malagard, is a [night hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) (with 150 hit points) whose work is on a grand scale. Her workshops are huge caverns in the rock, supplied with arches of bone that serve as gates from which her creations can leave, too vast to navigate the physical tunnels to the surface. She calls her work 'bespoke behemoths', living war engines of armor and tusks and spines, and she is happy to deliver them via her gates direct to a battlefield of her patron's choice if required. Malecki appears as plump and cheerful and is absolutely not to be trusted under any circumstance. Her creations are of undeniable power but are best released and then avoided as they've a tendency to forget who their master is soon after being deployed.

Malecki is still working on her latest creation, a yet-to-be-named fiendish war-machine (uses the statistics of a [goristro](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md) demon). It is tethered by a magical chain with a length of 5 feet (though given the creature's size, it is capable of reaching much further than that). Currently it is docile and apparently tolerates, if not enjoys, Malecki's grotesque surgery. If she is attacked, Malecki uses a bonus action to free it from the chain, and the creature defends her.

#### S10: Anacreda the Angelmaker

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A workshop that also appears to be used for the storage of spare creature parts is tucked away on the opposite side of the other basement chambers. Shelves line many of the walls, floor to ceiling, and upon those shelves sit several iron cannisters full of feathers of various plumages and colors.
> 
> A hideous winged woman is apparently examining the paraphernalia, though it is unclear whether she is looking for something or simply admiring the collection. Her dove-grey wings twitch, as she glances over her shoulder in your direction. She asks, "Are you here to commission a build, or have you arrived to offer my sisters and I a discount on the used body parts of one of your companions?"
^23f

Finally, there is [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) the Angelmaker, the leader of the coven. [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) (see accompanying stat block) makes beasts of the air and bears a great pair of dove-grey wings herself, a living advertisement of her skills. She is only ever hideous, never bothering to disguise her true visage, but at the same time she has a stern grandeur to her that strikes Fiends and mortals both with its gravity and awe. Nobody has tested her to find out how personally powerful she is, but when [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) herself comes to visit it is [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) she guests with. The two of them sit for hours, drinking peculiar vintages and exchanging secrets. And, while [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) is the one entity whom [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) visibly defers to as her superior, the archdevil treats the ancient hag better than most of her own direct subordinates.

#### Services

As well as making monsters to order, the three sisters keep up a busy trade in exotic components and pieces, part of a network of speculators, harvesters and collectors that spans the planes. In addition, they happily modify Fiends and even mortals. They replace and add limbs, senses, and organs, both on request from those seeking greater personal power, and to fulfill specific punishments for recalcitrant Fiends that [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) sends to them. Because they represent an unusual little blister of relative lawlessness in the Nine Hells, the sisters have also been known to hide fugitive mortals from infernal pursuit, for a priceâ€”though they're also not averse to taking payment and then betraying their guests, if they're feeling treacherous. The three sisters of the Hag's Arms are anything but reliable collaborators save where their business partners are too powerful to play games with.

When mortals do beg their services, the required payment varies. Most often they might simply ask for one member of the visiting groupâ€”as a plaything, for their soul, or to trade on to some fiendish creditor. As mortals are oddly reluctant to enter into that kind of transaction, they take other services. There is almost always some rare component one or another sister is after for her latest creation, and they've devised a variety of powerful geas-type bindings to ensure that any agreement isn't reneged on. They particularly like effects that have their errand-runners gradually mutate or deteriorate the longer the task remains undone. In game terms, any Geas they cast works as if it was cast at 9th level. In addition, the geas can only be ended with the [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell or by killing the hag that cast the spell.

All three sisters appreciate things that are in short supply in the Nine Hells. A bard's skilled performance, some witty repartee and a challenging game of skill might serve just as well as a quest across all the known planes for a piece of an ancient monster still currently within its original owner. Until you go before them, cap in hand, it's impossible to know how hard a bargain the hags will drive.

Risk-taking characters might want the hags to help them survive the dangers of the Nine Hells. Roll on the Hag Parts table... this is the modification available currently (this might change the next time the characters visit Malbolge). If the cost of 3 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) is paid, one character gains the modification after `2d4` hours of surgery. However, there is almost always a drawback. Roll on the Bad Deal table.

**Hag Parts**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-malbolge-the-realm-of-decay.md#^hag-parts)`

| dice: d8 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1â€“3 | The hags can apply a patchwork collection of skin to the character, granting the character immunity to either fire or cold damage (character picks before surgery). |
| 4â€“5 | A third eye can be grafted onto the character's forehead. It offers no benefit, but the hags lie and says it helps to see the future. |
| 6â€“8 | One of the characters' arms can be replaced with a tentacle. The tentacle gives the character advantage on ability checks made to grapple another creature, but the character can no longer use weapons with the two-handed property or perform tasks that require two hands, nor can the character use the tentacle to wield a shield or weapon. |

**Bad Deal**

`dice: [](09-chapter-8-malbolge-the-realm-of-decay.md#^bad-deal)`

| dice: d10 | Result |

| 4â€“6 | The adjustments have introduced an aspect of the infernal into the character and they're now vulnerable to radiant damage. |
| 7â€“8 | The character's walking speed is reduced by 5 feet. |
| 9â€“10 | The workmanship was shoddy and uneven. The character has disadvantage on initiative rolls. |

##### Deathstalkersâ€”Obtaining the Scourge of Shadow

If the characters are searching for the [Scourge of Shadow](Mechanics/items/scourge-of-shadow-coa.md), [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) wants to make a deal with them. She desires the head of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s chief general, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), in retaliation for a slight he made to her the last time he visited the inn. [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) promises to get the scourge, but only if they agree to having the [Geas](Mechanics/spells/geas.md) spell cast on them. Alternatively, if the characters defeat [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) and her sisters in combat, the hag bargains for her life by offering up both the scourge and [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md). The archdevil visits often, usually without any guard. What could be a better revenge for the characters, than killing the daughter of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)? The hag is more than willing to help set an ambush for the archdevil.

When [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) (see appendix A) arrives, [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) sits with her and serves a frothing tea that both consume. If [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) is cooperating to ambush the archdevil, the tea weakens [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) in the following ways. [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) can't use her Call Underling, Fiendish Regeneration, or Mesmerizing Gaze in Malbolge for 1 week. As soon as [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) finishes her tea, [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) beckons the characters from the shadows to attack. During combat, the hag uses her Spinewall to disrupt and corral [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) and she claws at the archdevil as long as the characters are nearby to assist. [Glasya](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/glasya-coa.md) doesn't seem overly surprised at the betrayalâ€”this is the way of the Nine Hells after all.
