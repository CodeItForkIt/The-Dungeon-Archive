# Chapter 4: Dis, the City of Burning Iron
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 81* 

![At the center of the Agora...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/080-0.webp#center "At the center of the Agora of Floating Knives sits Orishada's Palace.")

Named for its ruler, the Iron Lord [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md), Dis is the second layer of the Nine Hells and largely dominated by the city of the same name which is ringed by jagged mountains. Within the city, characters may find some of the items they're searching for.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Dis Overview" section. It provides you with everything you need to guide your players through Dis and its sprawling city.

### Encounters

After arriving in Dis, the players must either navigate the River Styx or follow the Iron Road to venture into the City of Dis. Their destination is the Agora of Floating Knives with Orishada's Palace at its center. Whilst on the river, journeying into the city, roll at least once on the Random Encounters in Dis table.

**Random Encounters in Dis**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-dis-the-city-of-burning-iron.md#^random-encounters-in-dis)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A pack of six [lemures](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md) have escaped the mines they were working. Four hell hounds pursue close behind. |
| 2 | Eight [spined devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/spined-devil.md) attack without provocation, mostly just for sport. They retreat from opponents who give as good as they get. |
| 3 | The characters notice an [imp](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) crouching on the rooftops, presumably spying on them. |
| 4 | A githyanki trade caravan makes its way toward the City of Dis. A half dozen [githyanki knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) on [young red dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) provide protection. |
| 5 | A lone [barbed devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md) approaches and demands 100 gp as tax for traveling across [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s realm. If he is attacked, he calls upon a pair of [war devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md) (see appendix B) circling hundreds of feet above to protect him. |
| 6 | A blazing orb of iron, seemingly ejected from a faraway mine, lands on a random character. It explodes and that character, and each creature in 20-foot-radius sphere, must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 70 (`20d6`) fire damage and 70 (`20d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The collected fragments of the orb are worth 2,000 gp. |
^random-encounters-in-dis

### Locations

When the characters arrive in the city have [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) provide information about the city and its different areas (see "Key Locations in the City of Dis" for a description). The players need to make their way to the Agora of Floating Knives, the trade district in the City of Dis. If the players decide to venture into any of the other areas of the city, you can use the information provided in this section to guide them on a short excursion. However, the conditions of these locales may quickly deter them from venturing there too long.

### Koh Tam and Tiax

At the Agora, give the players plenty of time to explore. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) or [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) can provide them with directions to the different areas of the Agora and its market stalls. If [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is accompanying the characters into the Agora, roll on the Troubles with Tiax table in chapter 1 to see if their outing with the gnome is eventful.

At this point, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) reminds the characters that his barge is able to Plane Shift to a layer of the Nine Hells above the current one, at any time. It requires a full action for him to activate the ability.

### Objectives

Make sure you keep track of your players' objectives and lead them to the corresponding areas so they can complete their goals. Once the players have explored all the different areas within the Agora of Floating Knives, make your way to Orishada's Palace.

The following objectives can be attained in Dis:

**Objectives in Dis**

| Objective | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| [Instrument of the Bards (Ollamh Harp)](Mechanics/items/instrument-of-the-bards-ollamh-harp.md) | The Agora of Floating Knives: Barges of Theater |
| [Cloak of Invisibility](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-invisibility.md) | The Agora of Floating Knives: The Market of Killers |

| [Wrought-Iron Tower](Mechanics/items/wrought-iron-tower-coa.md) | Orishada's Palace: The Floating Duke |
^objectives-in-dis

### Temptations

Have the characters encounter at least one temptation during their time in Dis. You can of course have them encounter more if you want. If the characters give in to temptation, use the information in appendix E to keep track of their corruption level.

> [!note] Troubled Rest
> 
> The characters might need to be encouraged to use all their various spells and means of obtaining information to track down the items and phylacteries they seek. At times you may also want to disturb their rest—perhaps resurfacing some of the nightmares described in the Introduction—as they approach layers of the Nine Hells where objects they need to obtain are to be found.
> 
> Nudge them towards stopping and exploring each layer appropriately but allow them the freedom to come up with clever ways to find what they seek.

## Dis Overview

> [!gallery]
> ![Dis, the Second Hell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/083-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/083-0.webp#gallery)

Outside the city proper, the layer is a mountainous crag land rich in ore deposits. [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) ordered the construction of the Iron Road, a pathway made of iron and cobblestone, to navigate the mountains and extract the minerals located within. Since its construction, the mountains are mined, and ore transported back to Dis for refinement.

Coiling down mountains high enough to reach Avernus is the Styx. It winds its way down towards Dis and crosses directly through before moving downwards towards Minauros. The city has an intricate canal system which the river flows through. With high walls and a deep bottom, navigators of the Styx see only the tops of buildings as they pass through the city. An artificial runoff near the middle of the city was created, with a large iron gate, allowing travelers to enter the city proper by taking a slight detour.

[Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) remains the ruler of Dis and an ally of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), and he intends for it to stay that way. Fortification of [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s layer continues unabated at his behest, in preparation for some future war. Assuming inhabitants follow the rules of the realm, they're given relative freedom to go about their business.

### The City of Dis

![The Iron Tower of Dispater...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/082-0.webp#center "The Iron Tower of Dispater Looms over the City of Dis.")

The city lies nestled within a fiery ring of mountains, with the only two ways in or out being the Iron Road and the River Styx. It is described by visitors as impossibly large and yet cramped at the same time. Like the Iron Road, its buildings are constructed from a mix of cobblestone and burning iron, both mined from the mountains of the realm. Because the iron is heated, it emits smoke and covers the city in a smog, making it difficult to see and breathe for mortals. Additionally, the city and the Iron Road are bathed in a warm light from the burning steel, with the surrounding mountains remaining dark aside from the lit mines. When the realm doesn't smell like smoke, it takes on the scent of burning flesh and blood.

Extraplanar travelers often stop in the city before moving on, due to its reputation as a hub for trade and commerce within the layers. Many bazaars and shops are set up offering strange wares from different planes, and [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) encourages any on the plane to establish contracts whenever possible. These contracts usually involve souls and the greater devils, who make homes in the massive iron towers scattered throughout the town. Beneath the city lies a labyrinthian structure of dungeons, said to contain mortals from the Material Plane. Vents in certain areas of the city allow bloodcurdling screams to float up from below.

### Leaving Dis

Unlike leaving Avernus, traveling deeper into the Nine Hells from Dis is quite difficult. The only two known passages are the Styx and a staircase, both of which descend to Minauros. Though the location of the staircase isn't publicly known, everyone assumes it to be located within [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s Iron Tower, making it difficult to find without connections. The Styx is especially dangerous, as the drop from Dis to Minauros consists of steep inclines, rapids, and waterfalls. It takes a seasoned captain or a large amount of luck to navigate the passage, leaving nascent souls or mortals without means of traveling deeper.

### Features

Iron itself bends to the influence of Dis. Whenever a good-aligned creature touches nonmagical iron, they take 4 (`1d8`) fire damage. This includes armor or weapons that creatures might be using, ammunition, storage devices, keys, etc. A Protection from Good and Evil spell or similar effect allows creatures to resist this effect for the duration.

As the most lawful of the infernal planes, visitors to this plane become bound to their words and contracts. Any time a mortal gives a promise, enters into a contract, or otherwise ensures their end of a bargain, they find themselves magically compelled to follow. A creature that breaks such a bond while on Dis takes 32 (`5d12`) necrotic damage and gains a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

## Key Locations in the City of Dis

Some of the major locations found in the City of Dis are described below.

### The Iron Tower of Dispater

Though several iron towers decorate the city, none are as large as the Iron Tower, [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s fortress and palace. It is visible from anywhere in the city, and through enchantment magic always appears to be very close. [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) maintains complete control over the tower—including the capability to shift its form and interiors to match his desires—and the tower can only be entered if he permits. If [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) has no interest in meeting you, even reaching the tower requires tremendous effort and immense willpower.

If the characters decide to visit, they struggle to ever reach the tower. Wherever they're in the city, the tower always appears right around the next corner, but no matter how long they walk, it never gets any closer. If the characters succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check and spend `2d6` hours searching, they finally reach the Iron Tower. If they fail the check, they waste `2d6` hours and are no closer, but they do trigger a random encounter.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After a final push, you reach the tower. Up close it is impossibly large. You squint as you look up but cannot make out its peak. The tower feels unwelcoming, and you feel a great heat emanating from it. There is no sign of door or window—the tower simply looms over you as if in judgment.
^13a

Unless the characters have business inside of the tower (and [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) allows them entry) the characters can't enter.

### The Garden of Delights

Devils from all layers are known to travel to Dis solely for the Garden, where all manner of luxuries and pleasures can be enjoyed. The Garden provides the income needed to improve [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s city and armies, and it keeps his citizens happy. The Garden also serves as a distraction for the denizens of the Nine Hells from the tortures of everyday existence in this bleak place. However, the characters are mortal beings and the illusions found inside overwhelm their minds. If they explore the Garden of Delights, they become enchanted by its beauty and may forget themselves. For considerable time they're unable to remember their mission and wander the Garden aimlessly.

> [!note] Temptation of Deceit
> 
> ***"The Liar"***
> 
> While the characters are exploring the Garden, a succubus approaches the character with the highest Charisma and offers to give them the power of deception. Run the appropriate temptation event found in chapter 2.
^temptation-of-deceit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Walls of sandstone rise above you and in front of the wooden doors to the Garden of Delights stand several attractive servants, beckoning you forward. You feel a strong compulsion to approach these comely beings.
^13d

The characters may pay 50 gp apiece to enter the Garden. Once inside they're handed cool and delicious (and illusory) drinks. Now roll a `d100`—this is the number of hours the characters waste, captivated by the illusory delights the garden provides. At the end of this time, a character must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw to even want to leave, if they fail the saving throw, they spend another `d100` hours within and must repeat the saving throw. When the characters finally succeed on the saving throw and depart, each gains a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

### The Great Prison of Mentiri

Mentiri acts as a maximum-security prison for the criminals of the Nine Hells. Inside, inmates are tortured and indoctrinated to ensure they follow the rules of the Nine Hells. This secure prison is located deep within Dis and within its walls contains many different kinds of prisoners—outsiders, captives from the Blood War, and others who have broken the laws of the Nine Hells in one way or another. The only way into the prison is being captured and condemned to rot there. The characters are lucky that they've no reason to enter.

> [!note] Temptation of Oppression
> 
> ***"No Pain No Gain"***
> 
> Read the following the first time the characters travel towards the prison:
> 
> > [!readaloud] 
> > 
> > Traveling towards Mentiri you pass a group of insect like devils transporting captives to the prison. Suddenly, an elf dressed in expensive looking armor makes a dash for freedom. Within seconds, the man is beset by a huge infernal raptor that carries him screaming into the sky.
> ^140
> 
> Later, on their way down from the prison the characters find the elf's armor on the side of the road but no sign of its former owner. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals it to be powerful magic armor. Run the appropriate temptation event found in chapter 2.
> 
> If the characters try to save the elf, they must fight the shredwing and the four pain devils (see appendix B for both) guarding the rest of the prisoners. The elf is already dead when the battle starts; it was just an animated corpse of an elf that has been dead for more than a thousand years.
^temptation-of-oppression

### The Agora of Floating Knives

The Agora of Floating Knives is one of the largest trading hubs in the known planes and is welcoming to non-devils.

## Adventure: The Agora of Floating Knives

The Agora of the Floating Knives is an enclave for non-devils made up of floating vessels located on the edge of the great City of Dis. Here mortals can purchase a variety of infernal goods and services.

In the City of Dis you can buy or sell anything, so long as that thing has a chance of harming someone, somewhere. Many of these markets are run by devils for devils, locked away within the cramped streets, behind the high walls. However, Dis is one of the few places in the Nine Hells that can be characterized as even slightly welcoming to outsiders. Travelers visit Dis for many purposes, but a great many come specifically for the Agora of Floating Knives. If the characters tell [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) that they wish to visit the City of Dis, he directs them to the Agora because of its accessibility to outsiders.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) gestures towards the city before you. "Dis is a city of commerce. If any of what you seek is here, the Agora of the Floating Knives is our most appealing destination. The Agora is an enclave for non-devils and is situated such that we can sail downriver and reach it without even having to risk the tangled confines of the city proper. Within its hundreds of floating stalls and huts we might find just about anything. And if we don't, we could risk an audience with Orishada, he is a powerful devil, and dangerous as any other, but he runs the Agora and is more willing to speak to outsiders than most."
^143

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) (or [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)) offers the following advice to characters, if necessary:

- They should hire an imp to guide them, or allow [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) to do so, if he's willing.  
- They might find what they're searching for in the markets. If not, then they might need to seek an audience with the ruler of the Agora, Orishada, a powerful [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse).  
- They're likely to see many disturbing things, but if they let on to any discomfort it could lead to trouble.  

This is a location well known to many travelers and [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) can provide a standard map of the Agora (see appendix F) to the characters.

### Approaching from the River Styx

Off the great runoff from the Styx, within the City of Dis, there is an artificial lagoon, square and shadowed by high walls. Here can be found the Agora of Floating Knives.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> It is a great armada of floating stalls and huts, houseboats, and rising from its heart an entire palace borne on the deadly waters. Imps and other menial demons can be seen plying gondolas along the narrow channels separating each establishment.
^146

### The Outer Agora Locations

Visitors relying on the services of the [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) (for the small sum of 10 gp) should be very specific in giving their destination, as the diminutive gondoliers delight in malevolently misinterpreting instructions every bit as much as an archdevil bargaining for a soul.

The periphery of the Agora consists of a ramshackle of little boats and rafts that offer the sort of goods that might be found in a dozen dens of vice across Dis, most often from the clawed hands of those who have been barred from more respectable infernal haunts. Vendors from other realms bring goods not native to the Nine Hells in an attempt to tempt diabolic custom, whilst petty devils from lower layers haul up treasures and resources unique to the infernal realms to sell at the small shops located here. There is a lively trade in Condensed Order, a silvery powder that can be extracted from those of a lawful persuasion. Devils bound for the warfronts of Avernus take flasks and snuff boxes of the stuff to fortify themselves against exposure to the raw chaos of demons.

Some of the more common items that can be purchased are listed in the Items for Sale table:

**Items for Sale**

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| [Condensed Order](Mechanics/items/condensed-order-coa.md) | 50 gp |
| Dream bottle | 50 gp |
| [Dust of Sneezing and Choking](Mechanics/items/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking.md) | 250 gp |
| [Oil of Sharpness](Mechanics/items/oil-of-sharpness.md) | 2,500 gp |
| [Oil of Slipperiness](Mechanics/items/oil-of-slipperiness.md) | 250 gp |
| [Potion of Fire Breath](Mechanics/items/potion-of-fire-breath.md) | 250 gp |
| [Potion of Mind Reading](Mechanics/items/potion-of-mind-reading.md) | 750 gp |

^temptation-of-jealousy

There is also a thriving trade market. These items are readily available for anyone who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. However, the buyer is only interested in trading for a magic item with [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) as an additional cost.

**Magic Items Trade Cost**

| Magic Item | Trade In |
|------------|----------|
| [Mirror of Life Trapping](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-life-trapping.md) | Rare or very rare wondrous item, plus 3 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) |

#### A1: The Arena

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cheering and jeering of spectators, as well as grunts of pain and shrieks of terror, alerts you to an open arena floating upon a barge. Several lodges are connected to it and from these buildings various challengers emerge, either to fight upon a field of battle, or to take their place against one another at tables of various games of chance. Just as you approach a devil knocks a piece sideways on a game board and rises, shouting out in victory. The tiefling sitting across from the devil moans as guards drag him into one of the buildings.
^14a

If the characters attempt to intervene, remind them it is important not to draw attention to themselves and that everyone participating in these games has chosen to do so. They may participate in the games themselves—feel free to have them fight against various devils and creatures of the Nine Hells. Or they can participate in games of skill or intelligence (use the Chosen One section below as guidelines). The prize for victory is 1 Soul Coin. The cost of failure is either death in the arena, or in the case of more civilized competitions, an hour of torture in the shacks (resulting in that character gaining one level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)).

##### The Phylactery of the Chosen One

If a character has selected the sin of pride, their phylactery is here. They see their soul competing in various arena games and constantly losing. As they approach each contest they do so with sunken shoulders and a worried frown. When they lose, they're mocked and punished. And they always lose.

The character may tap in and take their soul's place. They must compete in the following three challenges:

- **Test of Strength.** The character must fight a [chain devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/chain-devil.md).  
- **Test of Skill.** The character must either best a [horned devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) in a complicated game of knot tying or compete against an [erinyes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) to see who can calm an enraged [hellcat](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md) (see appendix B). Tying the knot requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check whereas taming the creature requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. If the character fails the check, they can try to make a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. If successful they bluff their way into getting a second (and final) chance on the original check.  
- **Test of Wits.** The character challenges an [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) to a dice game popular in the Nine Hells. The character must make a successful DC 15 Intelligence check to win the match.  

When a character loses a challenge, they gain a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). If the character rests or otherwise recovers from that [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), they must start all three matches over. They may repeat each challenge as often as needed to win but can have no help from anyone. Once they win all three matches, a succubus or incubus appears and hands them their phylactery.

#### A2: Neogi Shop

One of the shops in the Outer Agora is run by the enigmatic and ruthless [neogi](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/neogi-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse). These spider-like monsters are planar travelers that trade in magic items and prisoners. Their shop usually only stays in the same place for `1d6` weeks. Each visit to the shop brings the chance of danger, for sometimes the neogi aren't looking to sell items, but are more interested in acquiring new victims. A new shopper must make a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If they succeed, the items on sale are real. If they fail, then the items are illusory and the neogi have prepared an ambush. A [neogi master](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/neogi-master-mpmm.md) leads the ambush, with an additional [neogi](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/neogi-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) and an [umber hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/umber-hulk.md) for each shopper. More powerful customers might mean the neogi bring an additional `1d6` [gray renders](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/gray-render-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse). The Illusory Items table lists items that they sell, along with what the items really are if the neogi have decided to ambush the shoppers.

**Illusory Items**

| Magic Item | If Illusory | Cost |
|------------|-------------|------|
| [Apparatus of Kwalish](Mechanics/items/apparatus-of-kwalish.md) | A [hook horror](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/hook-horror.md) [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the neogi | 100,000 gp |
| [Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals](Mechanics/items/brazier-of-commanding-fire-elementals.md) | An [xorn](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md) [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by [Dimensional Shackles](Mechanics/items/dimensional-shackles.md) | 10,000 gp |
| [Cape of the Mountebank](Mechanics/items/cape-of-the-mountebank.md) | A rotting nonmagical cloak | 5,000 gp |
| [Carpet of Flying](Mechanics/items/carpet-of-flying-dmg.md) | A cheap carpet | 20,000 gp |
| [Cloak of Arachnida](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-arachnida.md) | A [cloaker](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/cloaker.md) that is the pet of one of the neogi | 15,000 gp |
| [Deck of Illusions](Mechanics/items/deck-of-illusions.md) | A set of playing cards with depraved images | 400 gp |
| [Demon Armor](Mechanics/items/demon-armor.md) | [Hezrou](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hezrou.md) [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by [Iron Bands of Binding](Mechanics/items/iron-bands-of-bilarro.md) | 40,000 gp |

### The Inner Agora Locations

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the mean skirt of barter and desperation can be found more magnificent emporia, two and threestory vessels moored in a hierarchy jealously maintained by the stallholders. There are grand platforms where demonstrations of very particular skills can be performed. Each auction house sells a specific brand of the unspeakable.
^14e

This is the Agora most visitors know, and it throngs with outsiders whose villainy, while it can't approach that of the devils themselves, nevertheless marks them out in their homes as exceptional. The Agora of Floating Knives is most famed as the center of the Nine Hells' murder trade. The four most popular destinations include the Barges of Theater, Market of Killers, Market of Victims and Orishada's palace.

#### A3: Barges of Theater

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A host of hideous entertainments are visible for the delectation of the casual visitor, carried past on boats and as advertisements at the doors of various establishments. Street torturers ply their trade to the laughter and applause of discerning crowds in much the same way as acrobats or stage magicians might in a less cursed city.
^150

Some of the horrors that a visitor might come across include:

- An archery competition where contestants permanently snuff out souls by shooting at writhing larvae pinned to a target board.  
- A still living Red Wizard whose body has been transformed into a teleportation circle.  
- A musical instrument where each key drives a skewer into the flesh of some poor mortal whose throat has been twisted to utter one note of perfect pitch. This last venue is run by a tiefling named Gazrak.  

Woe betide any visitor who shows distress at such theatre. With the Agora being so readily accessible, Orishada keeps a watching legion of [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) haunting the rooftops like pigeons, watching for any intruders who lack the appropriate immoral fiber. Those who do are followed by the imps until a squad of four bone devils arrive to exterminate them.

##### Conclave (Bard)—Instrument of the Bards (Ollamh Harp)

Gazrak (chaotic evil, tiefling [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) sells all manner of grotesque musical instruments, but he also owns an [Instrument of the Bards (Ollamh Harp)](Mechanics/items/instrument-of-the-bards-ollamh-harp.md). He is fond of the harp but also greedy. He suggests an outrageous price at first—30 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md). A successful DC 17 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can either lower the price to 20 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) or allow the characters to pay 100,000 gp instead of using [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md). Giving him a rare or very rare magic item as part of the exchange reduces the price by half.

#### A4: The Market of Killers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead of you is a crowded barge that criers announce in a dozen languages as the Market of Killers. Living killers from across the planes have flocked here seeking the highest fees. Devils tout dead killers, infamous in their lifetimes, but who are allowed back into the realms of the living for one more murderous job... at the right price. Crowded and frenetic auctions are held every hour, with the prize being a victim of the winner's choice killed via some particularly grotesque trademark method.
^153

In the Agora, perhaps the most mundane commodity one can hire at the Agora is the service of assassins. The characters can hire a killer to perform a single kill, not as some sort of retainer. If the characters are willing to spend enough, they might be able to use one of these assassins to rid the multiverse of a villain that they met during this adventure (or a previous adventure). You decide whether the assassin succeeds. A failed attempt might mean that the target turns the tables and sends an assassin against the characters.

##### Conclave (Rogue)—Cloak of Invisibility

To obtain the cloak the characters must hire the assassin (neutral evil, lizardfolk [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) who wears it, and then kill them for it. When they threaten the assassin he mocks them because he is protected by a powerful archdevil.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The assassin hisses at you. "Lay down your arms and move on, for know this: my patron is powerful and appreciate-s my s-special s-skills. They will be displeased if you s-strike out against me." The lizardfolk grins a toothy grin and slips the hood of the cloak overhead.
^155

They're still willing to assassinate an individual for the characters or meet them at a later date. If the characters do kill the assassin, they draw the ire of an archdevil (your choice), who makes the remainder of their adventures in the Nine Hells more dangerous. To avoid this, characters must purchase a dispensation from Orishada prior to killing the assassin. See the "Floating Duke" section. The dispensation costs 8,000 gp.

**Assassins for Hire**

| Killer | Cost | CR/Level that they can kill |
|--------|------|-----------------------------|
| [Thug](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) | 100 gp | 1 |
| [Gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) | 250 gp | 3 |
| [Assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) | 500 gp | 5 |
| Undead [drow mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/drow-mage.md)* who summons a [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) instead of a shadow demon | 750 gp | 6 |
| Undead [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)* | 1,000 gp | 7 |
| Undead githyanki knight* on a [young shadow dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-red-shadow-dragon.md) (red) | 1,500 gp | 8 |
| The yat-ja slayer (lizardfolk [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) with a [Cloak of Invisibility](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-invisibility.md)) | 5,000 gp | 9 |
| Saint of killers (fallen [planetar](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) with no wings or fly speed, dressed in dark leather) | 20,000 gp | 12 |
^assassins-for-hire

*These Undead creatures have resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Thunder damage; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. They're immune to the following conditions: Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Restrained. They have the following trait:

**Incorporeal Movement.** The killer moves through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The killer takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

#### A5: The Market of Victims

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Across from the barbarity that is the Market of Killers, there is the Market of Victims. Not a commodity you'd think would be in short supply in the Nine Hells, but there are victims and then there are victims. Each seller claims to cater to a very specific criteria of victim—a particular bloodline, a type of virtue, saints, angels, demons, emperors, and more.
^158

The kidnappers of the Nine Hells have contacts in every plane, on every world. They offer a comprehensive service. Many a high priest of some bloody god or other has procured the perfect sacrifice by sending their acolytes to the Agora with sufficient largesse.

##### Phylactery of the Bounty

The character seeking the phylactery that contains the soul of their bounty—the matron of a powerful noble family—is drawn to this location. They immediately notice a secluded corner of the market where an [affliction devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/affliction-devil-kocrachon-coa.md) (see appendix B) haggles with two [barbed devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md). One barbed devil clutches a bulging leather satchel. The character realizes the phylactery they seek is in the satchel. If they don't intervene the affliction devil soon takes the satchel and flies away. Instead, if the character interrupts, they can offer to buy the satchel. This negotiation requires a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If successful, the character manages to outbid the affliction devil and can purchase the satchel for 5,000 gp. If the result of the check is 20 or higher, the character's negotiation skills are insurmountable, and the affliction devil leaves negotiations earlier. The character only needs to pay 3,000 gp to purchase the satchel. Once the satchel is obtained, the character takes possession of this phylactery and receives the Phylactery Benefit associated with it.

#### A6: Orishada's Palace

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The palace at the center of the Agora is a vast leviathan of pumice and incandescent metal lit on the outside by some gruesome burning substance. Its walls bristling with a million barbed hooks, the only easy way in seems to be the massive double doors at its front.
^15b

Orishada and his select underlings offer unique services, both to the Nine Hells and to outsiders. They're proud of their range, in fact—enough that at least affecting to be a connoisseur of such things can win one an audience.

### An Audience with Aelvette

Using the iron knocker summons an [imp](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) that opens a slot just below. The imp promptly demands to know what valid business justifies the interruption. As long as a visitor describes the desire to purchase something that Orishada provides, then the imp permits them to meet with the majordomo of the palace.

Orishada's majordomo is Aelvette, an ancient [night hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) whose past has taken her in and out of the lower planes for longer than even most devils can recall. She has complete control of her appearance, able to decide for each viewer whether she should appear as alluring or hideous at any given moment. Her particular game is the Condensed Order trade; the silvery powder, highly valuable to devils, that can be extracted from those of a lawful persuasion.

Aelvette is sly, humorous and doesn't play by the rules in the way true devils do, which can make her either the best or absolutely the worst person to approach at the palace. The night hag attempts to discern if any of her guests are of an appropriate mindset to consent to have the Condensed Powder extracted, for a fair price. If she doesn't think this is likely, then she offers to play a game of chess or other logical exercise from an appropriate visitor. If the visitor agrees and loses the game, then this yields a gleaming phial of Condensed Order for Aelvette, but leaves the unwilling donor confused and off-balance (akin to the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition). The condition lasts for 5 minutes.

#### Playing Aelvette

The characters find themselves in a battle of wits with Aelvette. Either they have to impress her during a conversation in which she is testing their mettle, or they have to (try and) beat her at chess. The character with the highest Intelligence score should challenge Aelvette. Defeating the hag at chess or impressing her during conversation requires three successful Intelligence checks. The DC is 10 on the first check, 15 on the second check, and 20 on the third check. A character who has proficiency in the [Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight) skill can add their proficiency bonus to each of these checks.

Once Aelvette has finished plying her trade in powder, she informs her guests that her master, Orishada, wishes to see them. Before they meet with him, the night hag suggests that they partake of the services provided at the kitchens or the salon.

#### Conclave (Ranger)—The Iron Horn of Valhalla

Aelvette is in possession of the [Iron Horn of Valhalla](Mechanics/items/horn-of-valhalla-iron.md), a character searching for it has to steal it from her. When the characters enter Aelvette's chambers read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You are ushered into a large, oval room by the imp. It quickly scurries away leaving you alone with the figure at the center of the room. Behind her, the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Agora are opened, allowing the smoke and stench of the city to penetrate the air. The sparsely furnished room is dominated by a large stone table. On it a weathered chessboard is set up, the pieces positioned in what appears to be a game in progress. Aelvette, the majordomo, stands beside the table, studying the game set up before her. She appears deep in thought and doesn't pay you any attention. Your attention is drawn to a magic horn mounted on the wall behind her...
^160

This is the Iron Horn of Valhalla. The characters need to distract Aelvette to steal it. The most opportune moment would be when her mind is elsewhere engaged. Most likely, the characters will opt to have one of them move on the horn while she is playing chess with another character. Some characters might want to stage a different distraction. Whatever scenario they choose, a character stealing the horn needs to succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. If they fail, she notices the character creeping behind her and attacks—unless the character manages to convince her their intention was not to steal.

#### The Kitchens

![The most perverse delicaci...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/093-0.webp#center "The most perverse delicacies are prepared in Aelvette's kitchens.")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This massive kitchen contains sights and smells only a devil, or one interested in the macabre, could enjoy. Hulking chefs, whose limbs seem stitched together, shuffle about preparing meals as a devil directs them.
^162

In addition to managing the important business conducted in the palace, the majordomo, Aelvette, also presides over the devil chefs of the palace's famous Omnivorous Kitchen, an appalling side-business of hers known to the jaded and wicked across the planes. Who, after all, knows the best way to prepare just about any meat, to appeal to any palate, but a hag? Those who wish to sample the most forbidden delicacies flock to the palace, as do those who would learn the ghastliest recipes and culinary techniques across the multiverse. Not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach.

If their appetite is overpowering their morals, the characters may choose to order one of the delicacies from Aelvette's kitchen. Prices are listed on the Forbidden Delicacies table.

**Forbidden Delicacies**

| Meal | Cost |
|------|------|
| Boiled shank of minotaur | 25 gp |
| Candied spider eyes | 3 gp |
| Live owlbear | 1,000 gp |
| Lobe of grell | 12 gp |
| Poached stirge eggs | 1 gp |
| Prime cut of pegasus | 100 gp |
| Roasted jackalwere | 10 gp |
| Toasted salamander | 15 gp |
^forbidden-delicacies

The chefs working the kitchen are three [flesh golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md) directed by a [horned devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md). Any violence in the kitchens brings down the wrath of all the chefs and their overseer.

##### The Phylactery of Patricide

A character who has chosen the patricide sin discovers that one of the flesh golems is being whipped by the horned devil for failing to follow a recipe in the correct manner. Read the following to that character:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You realize the flesh golem's likeness is identical to yours and in the devil's face you see your own father's features reflected. A terrible sense of familiarity comes over you, reminding you of the dreams that have long been haunting you.
^164

The character must end this cycle of torment to gain their phylactery. The moment they attack the horned devil however, all the flesh golems, including the one in whom the character sees their own likeness, defend the vile creature.

Once the golems and the devil are slain, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The abused flesh golem looks up at you from where it has fallen. Then its flesh begins to burble and hiss, dissolving away, leaving behind a terrible stench and a tarnished phylactery that remains warm to the touch.
^165

The player has recovered their soul's phylactery.

### Corteso's Salon of Experience

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Tiny brains with legs run about this room that has been designated as a 'salon of experience'. Behind a thick glass window, you see a pool that contains a massive pulsating brain.
^167

Corteso's Salon of Experience is another peculiar service offered at the palace. Many devils have an infinite curiosity about what it is to be mortal. The illithid [elder brain](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/elder-brain-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) Corteso has accumulated a vast library of memories—specializing in experiences of sin and being sinned against. As well as counting for high entertainment to devils, students from the college of Maladomini flock here to refine their education on how to live among and manipulate mortals. Corteso is always in the market for a truly unique experience, and always has something to offer in trade. Its illithid spawn have been known to ensure that its offers can't easily be refused. Corteso's other racket is secrets.

The multitude of minds that it and its many broods have consumed grant the ancient intellect a vast storehouse of dangerous knowledge. Buyers come to learn exactly what they need to say, and to whom, to have some other murdered without getting their own hands dirty. Corteso specializes in jealous lovers, swindled business partners, ancient family feuds, anything that sows discord and inflames hatreds between mortals. Just what brought such a creature as Corteso to the palace and Orishada's patronage is a secret nobody knows, certainly one the creature has no intention of selling. Rumor has it Corteso created and then survived the destruction of multiple broods, evaded the attempts of many heroes to end its prolonged existence, and fled to the Nine Hells pursued by gith assassins and the agents of other elder brains which it had betrayed. Innately treacherous, it is 'loyal' to Orishada because only in the archdevil's shadow is it safe.

Corteso is always protected by a half-dozen [mind flayers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) and their [intellect devourer](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/intellect-devourer.md) pets. If asked where he obtains his memories, the characters are told their suppliers are many, but recently high-quality memories have been obtained from a location known as the Ineffable Trove, located in Minauros.

> [!note] Temptation of Harm

> ***"Carved in Flesh"***
> 
> One of the butchering knives, currently ensconced in a hunk of meat, appears larger and somehow more ominous than the others. It can be retrieved without alerting the golems and devil with a successful DC 16 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. The characters now have the Knife of Stolen Resistance (see appendix D).
^temptation-of-harm

#### The Floating Duke

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Orishada is a great, broad devil wearing clothes of metallic finery, richly bedecked in both mundane and exotic jewelry. "I hope you're not here to waste my time. My direct superior is [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) himself, lord of both city and layer, and he will be gracing me with his presence in a few hours. I see only very select buyers, which my majordomo assures me you are. I must assume you're here for the specific class of ware that I am known for: dispensations."
^16a

If his guests have no idea what he is talking about, Orishada—an [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse)—won't immediately order their deaths. He assumes it is part of some negotiation tactic. He summons one of his [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) to explain what a dispensation is:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "In the fine print of many an infernal contract there is a little clause almost never exercised. It's a 'boilerplate' clause that when exercised, gives an ironclad permission for the contract holder, their heirs or assigns, or any descendant or inheritor, to be murdered, without penalty or retribution. Such clauses have been around for many thousands of years, and my master, Orishada, makes it his business to collect them, or knowledge of them."
^16b

After the imp has finished, Orishada inquires as to whose dispensation they wish to purchase.

Given their multigenerational nature, a remarkable number of great and powerful people are covered by such clauses without ever knowing it. The dispensations that Orishada sells don't procure the death of the victim—that's what the rest of the Agora is for, after all. However, they do permit an assassin to disregard a variety of defenses up to and including divine favor, and protect the killer from curses, supernatural wrath, and other problematic fallout after murdering someone particularly important.

There is a 50 percent chance that any named evil creature/NPC is covered by a dispensation. This drops to 10 percent for good and neutral NPCs. A good rule of thumb is to have a dispensation cost 1000× the creature/NPC's challenge rating in gold pieces.

If his guests decline to purchase a dispensation or they're impolite or violent, Orishada becomes enraged and orders his personal guard to liquidate the intruders. These include a quartet of [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) and a half dozen [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md).

Orishada won't join in the slaughter, not because he doesn't want to, but because he can't. Orishada was a talented killer whose thousand-year career would raise the eyebrows of every assassin thronging the boats of the Agora. He finally allowed his bloodthirstiness to overcome his proper place, however, encompassing the death of one beloved to certain divine powers. In punishment, Orishada now lives out his endless life under a bitter curse. He can no longer inflict physical harm himself, not on the least insect, not even to a mortal. Because of this he uses his magic to aid his guards as best he can but won't intentionally cause damage.

> [!note] Insurmountable Odds
> 
> All the devils at this location defend either [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) (see appendix A) or Orishada if the characters attack either. It is unlikely characters can survive an outright onslaught and they may need some guidance to behave as cleverly as the devils themselves do in the Nine Hells. Dealing with just Orishada on his own is significantly easier.
^insurmountable-odds

##### Deathstalkers—Obtaining the Wrought-Iron Tower

[Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) is due to visit Orishada in a few hours. While extremely difficult, a particularly ingenious group of characters might be able to steal [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md)'s Wrought-Iron Tower (this is the staff that is his signet) through deception (though illusions won't work) or by simply snatching it and running for their lives. However, they can also learn from Orishada, who is a braggart, that [Dispater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dispater-coa.md) must leave his Wrought-Iron Tower with Orishada before he goes to an audience with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). He can't bring his symbol of power when he goes before his master, and he doesn't trust to leave it with someone at his abode; thus, he often leaves it in Orishada's care.

If the characters express disbelief that Orishada could safely care for such a powerful item, the devil bristles at the offense. He shows off the special chest he has had constructed to safeguard the artifact. The adamantine chest is built into the floor itself and hence unmovable and protected with a magical lock that requires a code writ in glyphs to be entered successfully, in sequence. Each failure results in a loud boom heard up to a mile away (surely drawing any guards' attention) and a devious trap. Each creature within 30 feet of the chest when the trap is triggered must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. A failed save results in 36 (`8d8`) damage of a type that the creature is vulnerable to (necrotic damage if the creature has no vulnerability). Succeeding on the saving throw results in the damage being halved.

A successful DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince Orishada to open the magnificent chest and when he does so a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check allows a character to notice the combination required to unlock it.
