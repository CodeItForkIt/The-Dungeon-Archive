# Chapter 12: Nessus, the Bastion of Asmodeus
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 195* 

![Nessus, a rocky wasteland.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/194-0.webp#center)

The final layer of the Nine Hells, bastion of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and heavily guarded by his legions, is the cracked wasteland of Nessus. It floats within an infinite, bloodred void, which extends in all directions. Very few are given entrance into Nessus, with the patrolling legions of devils ordered to kill trespassers on sight, including other devils.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter read the "Nessus Overview" section. As this is the final stage of the characters' journey into the Nine Hells, they need to find a way out of their contracts. Make sure the players get the chance to complete their quest objectives before triggering the final stage.

The individual character's score on the Corruption Tracker (combined with their choices in this chapter) determines the possible outcomes available to them. The information in the "Final Stage" section helps you prepare for the final encounters in this chapter.

### Encounters

The characters have entered the domain of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). Even if they manage to travel the layer without setting off his defenses, they're likely to encounter complications while they're here. Before the characters enter either the Oasis of the Lethe or Malsheem, roll at least once on the Random Encounters in Nessus table.

**Random Encounters in Nessus**

`dice: [](13-chapter-12-nessus-the-bastion-of-asmodeus.md#^random-encounters-in-nessus)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A singular [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) approaches the characters with a smile on their face. It offers a quick passage out of Nessus in exchange for 2 [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) per character. To each paying character it gives a wishbone, that when snapped, transports the character back to the Falls of the Frozen Titan in Cania. |
| 2 | Two [pit fiends](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) spar with each other, testing their strength. They invite any travelers to spar with them. If they find their sparring partner to be lacking in strength, they quickly change their tune to harvest a wayward soul. |
| 3 | A group of four [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) patrol the skies of Nessus, looking for any potential intruders. If they spot any, they approach and ask to see a writ of passage. If the intruder can't produce valid evidence, the group attacks. |
| 4 | Filled with rage by the sheer quantity of souls it absorbed, a [tyrant shadow](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/tyrant-shadow-coa.md) (see appendix B) rampages through the layer. Creatures of its size and strength are rare, and its death curries favor in the realm. If they kill it, the characters have advantage on all checks when interacting with the Triad. Additionally, when the tyrant shadow dies, `3d4` [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md) are created. |
| 5 | A pride of six [hellcats](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hellcat-bezekira-coa.md) (see appendix B), led by a particularly menacing bezekira, stalks Nessus looking for prey. They avoid opponents they feel they can't defeat. |
| 6 | Actively sneaking towards the center of Nessus is a single [balor](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/balor.md) dressed in black robes. It is constantly vigilant and approaches any creature that notices its presence. Its infiltration was difficult to secure, and it goes to any length to ensure no devil learns of its mission. |
^random-encounters-in-nessus

### Locations

There are other locations of interest in Nessus, but the characters are warned against visiting them. They should remain focused on their mission and limit the time they spend in [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s domain.

### Koh Tam and Tiax

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) or [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) (depending on who the characters sided with earlier) wait for the characters' return by the Falls of the Frozen Titan. Once they've gotten what they came for, they need the barge to travel the Nine Hells one last time, to freedom.

### Objectives

Before entering Nessus, the characters should have resolved their patron's mission. Make sure that all phylacteries have been attained. Once they enter [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s domain, they need to make haste and find a way to annul the contracts before [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) prevents their escape.

> [!note] Captured
> 
> If the events from chapter 11 led to the Dukes capturing the characters on behalf of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), they're brought before the Triad. They may not have all the necessary phylacteries to confront [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) yet. However, all isn't lost as they may still save their loved ones. The scenario with the Triad plays out slightly different if the characters were captured or not.
^captured

## The Final Stage

There are two ways that the characters can approach the last stage of their quest:

- [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) has an invitation to a place in Nessus known as the Oasis of the Lethe. In this place of learning, the characters can discover how to free their souls or the souls of their loved ones from the contracts that bind them. To get there, they must follow another infernal river, called the Lethe, which eventually brings them to the Oasis of the Lethe.  
- The characters can confront [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) directly. To do this, they simply must enter Nessus, whereupon the Lord of the Nine senses their presence and sends a force to escort them to Malsheem. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) won't deal with the characters initially, instead he leaves them to his faithful servants known as the Triad. If the characters navigate the trials of these three archdevils, then they might be able to convince [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to release the souls from their contracts.  

### Corruption Tracker

Before setting out in Nessus, consult appendix E. The information there helps you guide your players through the finale of their adventure. Do the following now:

- Tally the individual scores for each character on the "Corruption Tracker."  
- Use the Corruption table to determine if the character has become corrupted.  
- Use the Final Outcomes table to determine the resolution available to each character.  

## Nessus Overview

> [!gallery]
> ![Nessus, the Ninth Hell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/196-0-dm.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/196-0.webp#gallery)

Though the Styx freezes in its passage to Nessus, it doesn't completely dry up. Near the bottom, the temperature shift causes a small section of the river to melt and finish its journey to Nessus below. This stream is heavily guarded and flows a small distance before pooling into the Forgotten Lake, the last stop. From here, it drains into the porous stone of Nessus, traveling to the very bottom of the layer. It gurgles through a few of the deepest ravines before mysteriously vanishing on its journey to Gehenna.

An arid wasteland, Nessus resembles a rocky plain filled with cracks, pits, and canyons. The majority of the layer is flat, with only a few hills. Storms of fire and hot wind blow across its surface, and sandstorms aren't uncommon. Though many ravines mar its surface, only a few are important enough to have names. The Serpent's Coil is a massive ravine, rumored to contain [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s true body and caused by his fall into the Nine Hells. Its depth is practically infinite, and no creature has ever gone from the surface of Nessus to the bottom.

A close cousin of the Styx, the River Lethe originates on Nessus. Some scholars believe its pools are fed by the Styx itself, but the river's unique powers and secluded nature make such beliefs impossible to prove. From its spring in Nessus, the Lethe flows across the land, occasionally crossing ravines and canyons, before reaching the edge of the landmass. Unlike the Styx, the Lethe completely defies gravity, flowing over the cracks in the land without breaking its stride. It flows off the edge of Nessus unimpeded, where it continues to run off into the void, seemingly floating into the empty space.

Largest of all cities in the Nine Hells is Malsheem, home to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and his infernal legions. The city lies within the largest trench in Nessus and expands from its bottom to the skies, marking the center of the realm. From its spire, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) looks out on Nessus and, when the fancy strikes him, the rest of the Nine Hells. The only other structure of the layer, Tabjari, is a copper fortress built into the walls bordering Reaper's Canyon. An impregnable citadel, the structure is home to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s elite forces and acts as a vault, safeguarding his most valuable possessions.

All devils native to the Nine Hells, those that don't arise from the souls of the damned, are "born" on Nessus. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s true form continues to bleed from his wounds, and from this blood sprout devils. They're quickly redistributed to various other layers, depending on need and duty, with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) keeping only the most powerful. Each archdevil answers to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), the Overlord of the Nine Hells, who rules from the infernal throne in Nessus. They all plot and hope to gain the throne for themselves, yet [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has ruled the Nine Hells since their inception, and likely will continue to do so until the end of time.

Entrance into Nessus is nigh impossible, and rarely done. Those that choose to enter the realm do so by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s invitation or are almost certainly destroyed by the realm's defenses. As the lowest layer in the Nine Hells, exiting Nessus is only possible by ascending into Cania. Malsheem certainly contains portals of some kind within its walls, though their location is known only to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and his guards—as is their destination.

### Features

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) knows of all that enter his realm. Without some method of concealing their presence, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) always knows the relative location of each creature in Nessus. Visitors feel a constant state of paranoia, as if something is always watching.

### Climbing Down into Nessus

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The great gray swell of the River Styx begins to slow. Here and there great chunks of ice appear and are pushed along by the churning waters until they collide and begin accumulating into one mass that pushes up against the riverbanks. The ice becomes thick enough to stand on, but the rush of moving water below can be heard. Eventually this sound slows to a gurgling whisper and then falls silent. The ice stretches out for a distance, solid and white with arching crests where swells and rapids have frozen, and then it ends, and all that remains is empty sky. At the edge of the ice one can see out over the barren Nessus plains, vast and sprawling, reaching the far horizon. The drop below is dizzying. The powerful waters of the Styx have tumbled over the edge of the cliff and frozen into an enormous curtain of solid ice. The ground is scarcely visible, hazy with distance. Trapped within the plunging frozen waterfall is a titanic skeleton of humanoid shape dressed in gleaming armor. A giant.
^316

To reach Nessus, the characters must climb down the body of an ancient giant, half submerged in a frozen waterfall that is the last stage of the River Styx. This skeletal figure, of a scale beyond the stature of mortal Giants, is armored in gleaming mail that remains pristine and shimmers within the ice.

Although no more than bones, some trace of life still clings to the frozen titan. Those approaching hear its voice in their head, speaking whatever language is most native to them. It names itself as [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md), a warrior of law, who came to the Nine Hells unknown centuries ago and, after slaying countless devils, ended up imprisoned in the eternal ice of Cania.

[Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md) asks all passers-by to work towards freeing it, even if it is only to chip a few handfuls of ice away from its frozen tomb. Its words are persuasive, and an ability to read the thoughts of others permits it to tempt them with targeted inducements appealing to their morality, offering bribes, or pledging services.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a furious commotion around the titan's head. Mortals and devils brush shoulders as they chip and claw away at the ice around it. Some seem to be working in groups, others alone, but each acts with the same desperate fervor.
^317

Over time a cult of desperate dissidents has arisen around the ice-locked head of [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md). Some cultists are mortal travelers who have nothing else in the plane save their hope that the giant will somehow save them. Others are actual Fiends, outcasts or rebels fleeing [Mephistopheles](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-coa.md)' ire, who intend to use the skeletal giant as their war machine to fight their former master. Thus far the archdevil is either ignorant of the cult or considers action against it not worth the resources—or it is simply amused by its folly. The score or so of cult members pick feebly at the ice covering, attempt to light fires that the cold of Cania kills, and make sacrifices in the hope the warm blood and shed life force will help free their champion.

[Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md)' vast armored form is plainly a long way from being free, and to chip a little ice away might seem a meagre price to pay to avoid the predations of the cult. However, [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md)' true nature is very different, and the creature is far closer to escaping than it looks. [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md)' actual form is similar to a gelatinous cube, currently wrapped around the bones of the titan. It is a demon, a lieutenant or perhaps rival of Juiblex, which travelled down the swift flow of the Styx before being trapped in the ice. As soon as even a small hole in the ice pierces through to the chamber it is encysted in, the creature will surge out, feed off the flesh of mortals and devils alike and then seek to return to the river in the hope it can follow the current to more hospitable climes.

Characters must expend significant energy to free [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md). Track each hour of active digging/excavating, per character, with every 30 points of fire damage counting as an additional 1 hour of effort. Once this tracker reaches 50, [Devorastus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/devorastus-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) is freed.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Though your efforts have only produced a small, albeit deep, channel in the ice, there's a disturbing hissing noise, as if water has found its way to a tiny crack in a massive dam. A surge of pale liquid bubbles out from the hole you have created, almost instantly becoming a huge mound of ooze sticking to the ice. The trapped titan collapses as if whatever once sustained it, has escaped.
^318

The massive ooze-like demon, barely visible against the ice, climbs up or down as necessary, attempting to consume anything nearby. If no enemies are detected within 60 feet, it begins crawling upwards, in the hopes of finding a more comfortable resting place.

Climbing down the titan isn't without its dangers. [Shredwings](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/shredwing-coa.md) roost in parts of the body of the titan. `2d6` of them attack anyone descending, but once half of them are killed, the rest retreat.

![Climbing down the frozen giant to Nessus.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/199-0.webp#center)

### Entering Nessus Without Protection

If the characters enter Nessus without any protection against divination, then they are sensed by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) immediately. He sends a force to escort them to Malsheem.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From across the arid plains there comes a distant roar. The ground trembles slightly and a hot, sweeping wind follows, sending up a curtain of red dust. A shadow passes suddenly over the land ahead of you. It is immense and slips over the distance with alarming speed. A second shadow joins it. There is another ground-shaking roar and then the sound of snarling and the rattle of weaponry. A massive fiend approaches, red, winged, and armed with a heavy metal mace. Following it are four equally large devils with dark, leathery skin and wings and six devils with enormous horns carrying tall forks with sharpened tips that glow with heat. Flanking this monstrous party are two dragons. The scales of the beasts' gleam a brilliant red and the cutting wind born of their powerful wingbeats carries with it the scent of smoke and sulfur.
^31a

The escort is led by a [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) and includes four [war devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md) (see appendix B), six [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md), and a pair of [adult red dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) that the characters are to ride if they can't fly themselves. Even the most powerful characters will find this to be a difficult fight if it comes to violence, but the devils have been told to simply escort the characters, not imprison them. They only attack to defend themselves or if the characters refuse to accompany them. Proceed to the "Adventure: Malsheem" section.

### Traveling Across Nessus

Those traveling across Nessus can stick close to the River Lethe or strike out into the plains to avoid the traffic of devils that can be found along the river's edge. Below are two possible encounters.

#### The River Lethe

The River Lethe is, if possible, less navigable than the River Styx. In many places the river plunges over vast, wild falls, and devils have had to laboriously build complex sequences of locks to permit their great river barges to safely traverse the drops.

On occasion, political feuds between devils spill over into direct sabotage and action. Consignments of valuable goods—souls, sorrow wine, magic artifacts, and mortal prisoners—are wrecked or sunk as one diabolic magnate strikes indirectly against a rival. The falls of Telkalal are a favorite location for such skullduggery.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The crew of a merchant's barge is desperate, running around and tripping over each other as they try to catch grappling hooks on the jagged rocks that line the top of the falls. They have little success and the few lines that draw taut snap under the weight of the barge and the strength of the water. Terrified screaming can be heard from the cargo hold. The barge jolts as another line snaps and draws closer to the edge of the falls. The screaming increases in volume. The drop of the falls is monstrous and there are towering rocks below, cutting out from the white spray like hungry teeth.
^31d

The barge is carrying a tithe from the archdevil Orvrastus, intended for Nessus. The loss of this tribute will bring Orvrastus into bad odor with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). A variety of pettifogging bureaucratic obstinacies have resulted in [Fierna](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fierna-coa.md) of Phlegethos becoming irritated by Orvrastus, and she has sent a team of four [erinyes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) to haul the barge astray. Instead of travelling into the calm waters of the locks, the erinyes are attempting to drag the vessel over the falls, while the infernal crew back the engines and launch missiles at their flying tormentors.

A dispute between devils may not be of overt interest to mortals such as the characters, but the treasures on board may well be—whether they constitute people to be rescued or valuables to be pilfered. In the chaos of the fight, it might be possible to get on board the ship, loot it, and get off before it goes over the falls.

Alternatively, the characters could assist the vessel's demise, and then hotfoot it below to sieve the River Lethe for spilled treasures. In doing so they must contend with not only the usual denizens of Nessus, but habitual mobs of infernal salvagers intent on acquiring the same riches.

##### Treasure

If the characters are successful, they obtain `4d4 x 1000` pp and one rare magic item from the "Dungeon Master's Guide". The characters also find `2d4` [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md).

![Like the Styx, the River L...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/200-0.webp#center "Like the Styx, the River Lethe contains many dangers.")

#### The Plains of Nessus

![In an attempt to escape Ne...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/201-0.webp#center "In an attempt to escape Nessus, desperate souls have stolen an armored wagon.")

There is a saying in the Nine Hells, that nobody works harder than [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). The lord of all the Nine Hells neither sleeps nor rests, and whilst most of his servants devote plenty of time to sating their hedonistic pleasures, the greatest of all Fiends constantly bends his mind to the corruption of the planes and the ensnaring of souls.

Even [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) permits himself some entertainment from time to time, though his joys are little different to his duties. At times he enjoys hunting some of the more formidable captive souls in his possession.

Those he torments personally are, of course, lost beyond any hope of retrieval. Not one of them will ever escape his grasp. However, the finest razor edge of torment is that he persuades each one of them that there is a hope of reprieve. For his hunts, he often likes to allow his prey to think they've broken out of the prisons of Malsheem and that they've some sort of chance at freedom.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large, armored wagon, drawn by a colossal monster, careens wildly over the plains. Overhead, thin figures with feathered wings that still shine with faint celestial light swoop and fall.
^320

In this case, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has permitted a gang of desperados to stage a breakout, purely for the joy of hunting them down.

The supposed escapees are a selection of some of the worst the mortal planes have had to offer over several centuries. Their current leader—though they fight among themselves a lot—is an orc warlord named Ormogg (neutral evil, orc [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) with 120 hit points), whose hordes despoiled cities and burned forests and flooded dwarven holds with magma, but they've great sorcerers, wicked priests, tyrants and murderers among their ranks. As befits prisoners of the Nine Hells, each one is irredeemably evil. They've stolen—been permitted to steal—a vast armored wagon drawn by a monstrous beast, and now they ride it across the barrens of Nessus with a ragged mob of devils hounding their heels. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) watches on, greatly amused, until he decides to send in his special hunters.

> [!note] An Old Nemesis
> 
> This might be an opportunity to resurface villains from earlier in the character's adventures before they ventured into the Nine Hells, having them side with Ormogg in this prison break. Alternatively have the prisoners be comprised of an [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md), four [priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), six [gladiators](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) and eight [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md). The creature pulling their wagon is a [miasmorne](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/miasmorne-coa.md) (see appendix B) but it isn't truly under their control, at any moment it might turn upon them.
^an-old-nemesis

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s former captives are well used to the torment of Fiends. His Bright Hounds are something else. The breaking of angels is an especial pleasure to the lords of the Nine Hells. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) revels in perverting them to his while, twisting them into cruel falcons. He has stables of them, no longer resembling angels but their radiant power might still bite the hand that unhoods them. They represent an additional test of his mastery that makes the whole hunt truly interesting.

The Bright Hounds are comprised of four [devas](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) and two [planetars](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) (lawful evil and delivering necrotic damage instead of radiant). The characters, encountering the wagon on its headlong flight, might get involved in a variety of ways. The wagon's inhabitants, believing they know a way out of Nessus (which conveniently is at the Oasis of the Lethe, but is also just a lie planted by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)) may offer them a place aboard in return for fighting off the devils—only to be revealed as monsters almost as bad as the devils outside. The angelic hunters may provoke pity, though there is little the characters can do for them save end them.

## Adventure: The Oasis of the Lethe

![The oasis floats above vast desolation.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/202-0.webp#center)

Everything within Nessus' bounds is the unchallenged domain of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), yet the Oasis exists just slightly beyond. Enough to satisfy the legalistic minds of devils, perhaps. The River Lethe runs through Nessus, heedless of topography, reaches the edge of the wasteland and just keeps going. It flows forever into the red void, eerie, discomfiting, and unexplained. The greatest infernal minds can't account for it, nor any god that has been petitioned for an answer. What lies at the end of the Lethe? Does it empty out into another constellation of planes? The question has ever troubled philosophers and cosmologists. And so, on the banks of the Lethe, a community of scholars and wizards has arisen to study this phenomenon and, through it, the underlying nature of the planes themselves. The Oasis of the Lethe is their haven.

### Advice from Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) previously gave the characters an infernal map. Show the players the map of the Oasis of the Lethe in appendix F. They can use this map to decide which points of interest they want to explore. Refer to the "Using an Infernal Map" section of chapter 2.

### Monsters of the Red Void

There are certainly threats that come to trouble those at the oasis. Inexplicable monsters sometimes undulate out of the red void—bizarre beasts never seen before and never replicated. Whilst they represent unparalleled opportunities for study, they also devour the occasional student. Desperate fugitive souls and marauding adventurers fleeing [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s pursuit occasionally find their way to the Oasis and make demands of the arch-magister Elihandrel, though thus far his magical abilities have sufficed to return them to the archdevil's custody in short order. Sometimes conjurations called up by the mages themselves get loose and have a brief career of havoc before they're banished once more. But from the devils of the Nine Hells themselves, there is no threat. They're as obliging as the most unctuous servants.

### Oasis of the Lethe Locations

![Elihandrel lures scholars ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/204-0.webp#center "Elihandrel lures scholars to the Nine Hells with the promise of knowledge.")

Some of the major locations found in the oasis are described below.

#### O1: Arrival

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Oasis is a floating island seemingly tethered magically to the endless flow of the River Lethe, a mile out from Nessus' edge. In contrast to the barren plane, it is green and verdant, thronging with life. There are trees meticulously trained together to form living buildings; there are pools of sparkling water that promise refreshment. Animals and birds dwell here, apparently without fear of mortal or devil. Lions and lambs, serpents and deer, all living in harmony.
^327

Within the buildings of the Oasis there are libraries that would make a sage weep, telescopes and scrying pools and all manner of divinatory instruments to look into Nessus and the river and the wider planes. There are debating rooms and places for quiet contemplation. Any mortal who has ever valued the pursuit of knowledge instantly feels that they've come home.

##### The Researchers

Some of the planes' greatest minds can be found here studying the intrinsic nature of the cosmos—both the living who have made the arduous journey and the souls of the dead. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) sporadically signs orders releasing the most learned of scholars within his domain from their torments so that they may aid in the research of the Oasis. The prospect of questioning the great minds of elder days is enough to bring some visitors to the community here.

#### O2: Home of Teskethmus

One of the most respected minds of the current roster of scholars at the Oasis is that of Aldri Teskethmus, a living human [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) of the Red Wizards, who theorizes that the traditional arrangement of the planes is merely an artifact of mortals' limited ability to comprehend the wider universe.

#### O3: Home of Orvedarc

Orvedarc is a [duergar](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/duergar.md) heretic priest-scholar who died centuries ago and has spent time in the Nine Hells both in torment and in service to devils. Now released, he works on his incomplete research into the nature of divinity and divine magic.

#### O4: Home of Isitrix

Isitrix the Termagant is a sahuagin magician-queen ([mummy lord](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord.md) but she isn't Undead, her creature type is Humanoid) who in life brought wars that encompassed entire oceans, but who now peaceably studies the River Lethe and its curious mechanics.

#### O5: Home of Elihandrel

It is an inevitable fact that those long-dead souls at the Oasis are mostly of evil persuasion. There are other incautious mortals who fall into [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s power, but the majority of souls in his domain are those drawn to the Nine Hells by the choices they made in life. However, the arch-magister of the Oasis, Elihandrel (use [empyrean](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) stats but Elihandrel is Medium sized), keeps order. His word is law, as much as [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s is within Malsheem. Those who won't abide by his codes of peace and scholarly amity know that a return to the Nine Hells awaits.

Elihandrel himself is an ageless high elf, robed in simple grey. He appears mild, confident in his authority and power, proud of the peaceful community he has built. His soft-spoken word is the end of any disagreements, ensuring that those under his charge never let civilized debate get out of hand. His guests have everything they need—the trees bear endlessly nutritious fruit and there are always books, tools, and scholars' supplies of surpassing quality. He even sanctions research expeditions to other layers of the Nine Hells. At his beck and call are a staff of curiously meek devils, still monstrous of aspect but on their very best behavior. Elihandrel himself reports to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) on a regular basis, sharing all the knowledge that his faculty uncovers. He denies that he is in any way enabling evil. Learning, he insists, is without alignment. His ultimate goal is to push past the adversarial model of the universe that has trapped all life in constant conflict, law against chaos, good against evil. He genuinely believes that a full understanding of the planes can lead to a perfect future without hardship or sin.

Elihandrel is very eager to spread word of his faculty out into the wider planes. He maintains correspondence with a number of temples, universities, and mage schools on the mortal planes. Whilst the appeal of studying the secrets of the Nine Hells is plain to evil mages and luminaries of all kinds, Elihandrel is very keen to maintain balance by attracting those of other aspects as well. He writes persuasively of the possibility of studying the heart of evil with an eye to countering its influences. One must truly understand a thing before one can defeat it, is his frequent refrain. Scholars visiting the Oasis from the mortal planes find the opportunities of the place overwhelming. There is always something new to learn—and not just miserly scraps but the great truths of the universe hanging just out of reach like fruit ready to be plucked. Conversation with other resident scholars is transcendent, opening the doors of the mind. Very few ever want to leave once they arrive.

#### O6: The Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There are four grand hallways in the library. Each so vast and tall that neither their ends nor their ceilings can be seen. Magnificent marble pillars line the hallways, dividing them into sections, and each section stretches off until it is lost in distant shadows. There are upper levels, and these also grow faint as they rise beyond where the eye can see. Elaborate, curling staircases descend underground, suggesting further levels below, and rise upward until they vanish. Every available space, every nook and cranny, every shelf and row, is filled with books. Books, packed tight in neat rows and layered in towering stacks, stretching on, it seems, to eternity.
^32e

The knowledge contained within the library is unrivaled. An [amnizu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/amnizu-mpmm.md) (see Monsters of the Multiverse) is the caretaker of the library, but also fully empowered to modify or annul contracts. Before the characters can ask for his assistance however, they need to prepare their arguments. The legal documents section of the library is where the characters find books that contain the clauses they need to build their case. However, if they want to look around the library before getting to work, there are many other sections of interest at the Library of Infernal Knowledge. Once the characters are ready to start searching for the clauses needed to annul their contracts refer to the "Legal Documents" section.

### Infernal Knowledge

Magic books and other knowledge can be acquired here. But if all these seem too good to be true, that is because they are. Characters should feel uneasy as they begin to acquire items and knowledge; everything has an ephemeral feeling to it.

#### Personal Growth

All these books work exactly as described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide":

- [Manual of Bodily Health](Mechanics/items/manual-of-bodily-health.md)  
- [Manual of Gainful Exercise](Mechanics/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md)  
- [Manual of Quickness of Action](Mechanics/items/manual-of-quickness-of-action.md)  
- [Tome of Leadership and Influence](Mechanics/items/tome-of-leadership-and-influence.md)  
- [Tome of Clear Thought](Mechanics/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md)  
- [Tome of Understanding](Mechanics/items/tome-of-understanding.md)  

#### Magical Power

There are various arcane scrolls and books here.

##### Spellbooks

Several tomes contain descriptions of previously unknown 9th-level spells apparently more powerful than any known spell. With the right components, and a week of study each, these writings can be turned into actual spells that could be used by wielders of arcane magic. These spells include:

- **The Killing Winds.** These winds create a hurricane 5 miles in radius that deals necrotic damage to every living being within.  
- **The World Weave.** This spell changes the climate in a region permanently.  
- **Ioulaum's Longevity.** This spell extends the caster's life by snuffing out every life in a 1-mile radius. Each Humanoid life consumed adds a year to the caster's life.  
- **Volcanic Eruption.** This spell creates a volcanic eruption that lasts for days and devastates a region 100 miles in radius.  
- **Move Mountain.** This spell allows the caster to cut the top off a mountain and use it as a floating platform upon which a city or fortress might be built.  
- **Spheresail.** This spell allows the caster to create a spelljammer.  

#### Religion

Several religious tracts focus on topics pertaining to divinity and describe new and powerful 9th-level spells. After a week of study and communion with the source of their divine magic, clerics and druids can learn the following 9th-level spells:

- **Dire Winter.** This allows the caster to bring about a winter across an entire continent that lasts for `2d12` years.  
- **Vengeful Gaze of the Gods.** A powerful single target spell that simply annihilates anything that doesn't possess legendary resistance.  

#### Item Crafting

There are various other tomes here too:

- **The Tomes of Asgardian Metal Working.** Describes how to forge the Hammer of Thunderbolts and various Belts of Giant Strength in half the normal time and at half the cost. Additional margin notes suggest ways to make these items even more powerful.  

### Legal Documents

It is here, in the legal section, where the characters find the loopholes needed to annul the contracts. Each hour that is spent searching requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find the legal books that are needed to annul one of the contracts.

Once a character has found a loophole, they can ask the caretaker to annul the contract. The caretaker is only too happy to oblige, commenting on the vigorous and impressive research the character has done to prepare their case. However, a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check informs a character that it might be best to wait to trigger an annulment until all the loopholes required for all the characters are found.

> [!note] Corruption
> 
> All of the characters can find the loopholes to their contracts within the library. However, for any characters who are corrupted during their time in the Nine Hells, annulling the contracts isn't the end of their troubles. Use the information in appendix E to guide the characters through their next steps.
^corruption

#### Between a Rock and a Hard Place

Read the following only if there are corrupted characters among the group. It should be read aloud when the caretaker reviews the contract of a corrupted character.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The caretaker's enthusiasm for your meticulous research is noticeable. His eyes light up each time he reads yet another cleverly worded part of your defense. After several minutes he is interrupted by an attendant that whispers something in his ear. Whatever is said, it can't be good. The caretaker's shoulders slump and the devil looks sincerely deflated as he addresses you. "All for naught, it was all for naught. The Lord of the Nine Hells saw you coming, he did. I gather it was all a big game for him. I can annul the contract, yes that I can do. But I cannot undo the evil you have done during your stay in the Nine Hells. Your soul... it is truly lost. Only the Triad can help you now."
^338

The caretaker informs the corrupted characters of their predicament. If they want to improve their own fates, they have one more stop to make: they need to plead their case before the Triad at [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s palace in Malsheem.

#### Escape

As soon as the caretaker undoes one of the characters' soul contracts, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) realizes what is happening and initiates a purge (see "The Purges" section for more information). Every minute that the characters remain at the Oasis, they must roll on the Random Encounters at the Oasis table.

**Random Encounters at the Oasis**

`dice: [](13-chapter-12-nessus-the-bastion-of-asmodeus.md#^random-encounters-at-the-oasis)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Nothing |
| 2 | A [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) |
| 3 | Five [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) |
| 4 | Three [maelephant nomads](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md) (see appendix B) |
| 5 | Two [war devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/war-devil-coa.md) (see appendix B) |
| 6 | Nothing |
^random-encounters-at-the-oasis

Once the characters have escaped the Oasis, they're relatively safe as long as they continue to use the magic that keeps [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) from knowing their location. If some of the characters are corrupted, they must travel to Malsheem and try their luck with the Triad. Otherwise, proceed to the "Leaving the Nine Hells" section at the end of this chapter.

#### The Purges

![An unholy deal: no one but...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/207-0.webp#center "An unholy deal: no one but Elihandrel survives the purges.")

There is, of course, a problem with the Oasis. This is Nessus, after all.

The deal that Elihandrel made with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) is known to almost none. Nobody really gets a chance to talk about it once the archdevil collects. Despite being beyond Nessus' physical borders, the Oasis remains in [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s domain, and Elihandrel must pay rent for his tenure there. At irregular intervals, carefully calculated by complex infernal clocks, the forces of the Nine Hells visit the Oasis and sweep it bare of everyone save Elihandrel himself. Every scholar and soul is hauled off to Malsheem, to be dissected for all they know and then put to eternal service or suffering as [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) prefers. To study at the Oasis is to tacitly permit the Nine Hells a claim to your soul, and over the centuries the archdevil has drained the best and brightest minds of the planes by indulging Elihandrel's little project. The arch-magister himself considers the deal unfortunate, but a small matter compared to the vast reams of learning that his charges uncover. After all, the libraries remain intact. Nothing, therefore, is truly lost.

Read the following narration aloud when a purge occurs:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a powerful crashing sound somewhere in the library, followed by a roar and a piercing scream. The scream is joined by another, and then another, and the roar too gains company until the cold, marble halls echo with a cacophony of gleeful snarls and beastly roars and terrified, pained screaming and wailing shrieks.
^33b

> [!note] The Forgetful Scholars
> 
> Any knowledge or spells that a character learned at the Oasis is lost within `2d12` hours of leaving. This includes attribute adjustments from books such as the Manual of Bodily Health.
^the-forgetful-scholars

#### Knowledge That Doesn't Travel

The learning of the Oasis, that seems infinitely convincing to all the scholars who debate within its leafy halls, doesn't travel. Like a wine of uncertain vintage, the further you carry it from its region of origin, the less satisfying the taste. The cast-iron logic of Elihandrel and his fellows weakens, or else becomes abstruse, impossible to follow. It all sounds very intelligent until someone starts picking at the details, and then it seems to mean nothing at all. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s last joke on the Oasis is that almost everything that those serious and high-minded scholars write down is complete nonsense once taken away from the curious influence of the Oasis itself. Almost everything. The final barb of the archdevil is that every so often something that Elihandrel disseminates to the wider planes turns out to be of incalculable value, a true insight for the ages, perhaps even a weapon that can be turned against the Nine Hells. Those little scraps of true value mean that even those scholars who suspect the true nature of the Oasis still hear the siren call of temptation. After all, are they not the greatest minds of the age? Surely, they will be shrewd enough to outwit the trap the Oasis represents. And [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) smiles to himself as yet another great sage descends to Nessus clutching one of Elihandrel's invitations, because there is no pride sweeter than the folly of the wise.

## Adventure: Malsheem

Read the following when the characters approach Malsheem, either on their own or escorted by devils.

![Malsheem, the seat of power.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/208-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Malsheem is a behemoth of a city. It stretches from the bottom of a deep, jagged trench to the heights of Nessus' blood red sky, its towers and flagpoles stabbing like spears through the thick, roiling clouds overhead. In width it is also massive, swollen so greatly that the giant trench in which it lies seems a tight fit. There is a strange and frightening beauty to the place. Even from a distance you can see that the city's walls are uniform and polished, the curling spires of its palaces are precise and elegant and everywhere there is the gleam of precious metal and the light of burning fires.
^33f

There are several ways the characters might arrive at the city: captured upon entering Nessus and taken directly to Malsheem, brought here as captives of the Dukes—some brave characters may even choose to walk into the city themselves. No matter how they get here, they always enter through the city gates of Malsheem. Here they're met by an escort of two [pit fiends](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) and eight [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) who announce that they're to be guests in the palace of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). The characters can go with them or attack. If they attack, the devils are joined by another pit fiend on initiative count 15 of every round. Once defeated, the characters are deposited at the palace for an audience with The Triad.

### The Palace

When the characters arrive at the palace, they are confronted by the three archdevils known as the Triad.

#### The Triad: Rimmon, Zagum, and Buer

This triumvirate of bloated devils were angels once, who fell alongside their master back at the dawn of all things. Rather than committing to taking arms against the gods or embracing their fate, they attempted to play lawyer with the divine. For an age they sought to escape their fate by exploiting technicalities in what it truly meant to rebel or be counted among the supporters of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). Eventually, their legalistic hair-splitting failed, and the gods delivered them to their master, who viewed them with utter contempt. He transformed them from their radiant angelic forms into great floating sacs of flesh and made them his notaries, so they could exercise their lawyerly talents in his service.

The Triad might appear homogenous to mortals at first sight, but they have different natures and predilections. Just as deities of fate often have a threefold nature, spinning, weaving, and cutting the strands, so the Triad are an equivalent for the contracts of the Nine Hells:

- **Rimmon.** (see the accompanying stat block), vast with weaving tentacles protruding from his form, drafts the twisted wording of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s agreements—festooned with hidden loopholes, and buried subclauses to bind the unwary while denying them the rewards they truly seek. He has a fiendishly creative mind, fond of games, wordplay and inordinately long sentences with clause nested within clause until any sense of meaning eludes the reader entirely.  
- **Zagum.** (see the accompanying stat block), is the interpreter of contracts, who takes the complexities [Rimmon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/rimmon-coa.md) creates and uses them against the signatories, arguing the case of the Nine Hells in courts across the planes and ensuring that even the wiliest soul can't escape [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s reach. He is a dry, thoughtful devil with a sense of humor. In those rare occasions where a mortal advances a line of argument that interests or surprises him, he has been known to recruit them to his staff of twisted legal minds—as an alternative to having [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s eternal enmity. While [Rimmon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/rimmon-coa.md) is an introverted wordsmith, [Zagum](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zagum-coa.md) is gregarious, happy to share a joke and a drink with a mortal he is about to shackle to eternal torment.  
- **Buer.** (see the accompanying stat block) is the torment. Her role is to enforce the contracts once [Zagum](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zagum-coa.md) has proved their binding nature beyond any doubt. Her hideous maw can chew over souls eternally and she is utterly without mercy, the inflexible lash of the law. When the Triad are forced to fight, it is [Buer](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/buer-coa.md) who brings the physical threat while the other two rely on magic to support her. Their greatest weapon, in the fray, is that those who are bound by infernal contracts are automatically vulnerable to their powers. In the small print of all their agreements is a clause of implied consent, so that every spell cast by the Triad can evade any attempt at resistance, and any physical defense comes to nothing. When you sign the contracts of the Nine Hells, you really are agreeing to get everything you deserve, whether you want it or not.  

#### The Contracts

The Triad acknowledges that the characters have likely come to Malsheem to nullify the contracts that bind either them or one of their loved ones. They have the power to nullify the contracts, but only if the characters give an item of value or provide a service.

> [!note] Unfinished Business
> 
> In the event the characters come before the Triad after being captured by the Dukes, they may not have gathered all needed phylacteries. It should be clear to them that performing a service for the Triad is their best option. If they agree to do this, they're allowed to leave the palace. They can collect the phylacteries, capture [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), and resume negotiations.
^unfinished-business

#### A Service to Be Provided

![Baalzebul's slug form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/212-0.webp#center)

The characters could opt to trick [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) into leaving Maladomini, so that [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) can turn the archdevil back into his slug form. To do this they must capture [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s trusted lieutenant [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md). [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) knows exactly where the infernal submersible that [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) captains can be found. Once they capture the submersible, they must use the aboleth within the infernal submersible to lure [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) into trying to rescue [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md). When [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) turns into a slug and realizes he has been tricked, he does everything in his power to kill the characters.

#### Items of Value

Alternatively, the characters might offer items of value:

- Two very rare magic items or one legendary magic item are appropriate payments.  
- One of the characters' life and soul.  

#### Leverage

The characters can avoid the previous options if they've come across knowledge that gives them leverage over [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md):

- If the characters have discovered the plans that [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) gave to the Brothers Morax and Adramalech, then they can use this as leverage. However, if they have the plans on them, then the Triad reminds them that those can easily be taken off of their dead bodies.  
- If they learned the secret of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s origins from [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)'s aboleth, that is significant leverage.  

#### Negotiating

This final negotiation is influenced by the choices the characters made during their time in the Nine Hells. If they're corrupted their options are severely limited. However, if the characters managed to keep their souls relatively untarnished, they have more options and may be able to outmaneuver the Triad. For each individual character, check the Final Outcomes table in appendix E to see which options are available in the negotiation.

##### Setting the Terms

A corrupted character who came to the Nine Hells to free their loved one can choose to add one of the following clauses to their new contract:

- You sacrifice your loved one to ensure a better position in the Nine Hells for yourself. Your loved one is returned to their torment. However, you're free to live out your life as an agent of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). After you die, you arrive in the Nine Hells as a pit fiend. After you sign this contract, you may choose any 2 of the epic boons available in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" (a successful DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can increase this to 3).  
- You commit to becoming an agent for [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) for the rest of your life. In exchange, the soul of your loved one is released from their contract. After you die, you arrive in the Nine Hells as a horned devil.  

A corrupted character who came to the Nine Hells to free their own soul has limited leverage with which to negotiate. They can try to improve their situation in the afterlife, however.

- You agree to become an agent for [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). This guarantees you arrive in the Nine Hells as a horned devil upon death. A successful DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check upgrades this to a pit fiend.  

Uncorrupted characters have a better position in these negotiations and can easily convince the Triad to release their loved ones or themselves from their bonds with this new contract.

##### There Is Always a Catch

Once terms have been agreed upon, the Triad writes up the contract. However, there are some obvious loopholes that could be exploited by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). There are three loopholes in total, one written by each of the Triad. A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals the first loophole and alerts the characters that they're being tricked, lowering the DC for finding the second and third loophole to 15. Once discovered, the characters can succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to have the loophole removed—or they can threaten violence. If they're violent, then whoever they've threatened attacks. If it wasn't [Buer](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/buer-coa.md) that they threatened, she helps in the attack. The other(s) stand back and watch. At half hit points the hostile devil accepts defeat and removes the loophole.

Once the contract is finished, the characters are told to take it to [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) for his signature.

### Audience with Asmodeus

An audience with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) (see appendix A) is something that very few mortals have ever had. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) doesn't want to meet the characters just to sign their contract. He could have let the Triad handle that. He always has another angle to push, and the characters should be on their guard during what turns out to be his final temptation.

If any of the characters managed to free their loved ones without damning themselves in the process, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) wants to convince them to serve him one last time. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) butters up the characters by saying that he has witnessed their power, tenacity and ingenuity and has been greatly impressed. He tells the characters that he has an offer.

Any of the characters can agree to sign a contract that stipulates that their soul goes to the Nine Hells when they die. However, they will arrive in the Nine Hells as horned devils. A successful DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can make it so that they arrive in the Nine Hells as pit fiends instead. In exchange for their souls [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) will grant them power undreamed of by most mortals. They can choose any 2 of the epic boons available in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" (a successful DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check increases this to 3).

While he is disappointed if none of them accept his offer, he won't harm the characters. Instead, he teleports them back to [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge. See the next section.

## Leaving the Nine Hells

At this point the characters may have been teleported back to [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), or they may be fleeing the Oasis. Regardless, once they reach the barge, your adventure is almost complete. It may be as simple as using the barge's plane shift capability to rise ever upwards from the lower layers to the higher. Or the characters may have unresolved grudges or debts to repay. Regardless, the characters have, in whole or part, bested the archdevil [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) himself.

That is both an accomplishment and a signal to higher powers that the characters themselves may be a growing threat...

![Asmodeus towers over his guests.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/213-0.webp#center)
