# Chapter 11: Hunted by the Dukes
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 179* 

![Abigor, Duke of the Nine Hells](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/178-0.webp#center)

The events in this section may occur at any time during the characters' journey through the Nine Hells.

Not all dangerous devils confine themselves to a specific layer of the Nine Hells. Some roam, either escaping from enemies, or hunting potential victims. Among the greatest of these powerful devils are [Brother Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) and [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md), who are agents of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and command a warship, the likes of which have never been seen outside the Nine Hells. But [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) also has an agent who travels the River Styx—an archdevil known as [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), who pilots an infernal submersible.

## Running This Chapter

There are two methods by which the characters can encounter either of these naval opponents. Either the characters are hunted by the warship or the submersible, or the characters hunt one, or both, of these devil-ships.

### The Hunters

The archdevils, [Brother Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) and [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md), have been tasked by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to hunt the characters down and take them captive. If they succeed in taking the characters captive, then they take them to Malsheem where they're confronted by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) (refer to the section on "Malsheem" in chapter 12).

The archdevil [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) has been tasked by [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) to simply kill the characters and eliminate the threat to him that they present.

### The Hunt Begins

These archdevils start searching for the characters once they've completed one of their group patron's objectives. From this point on, every time the characters move between layers (while on the River Styx) there is a 25 percent chance that they're intercepted by one of these foes.

If the characters are intercepted, proceed to the "Ambushed by the Infernal Warship" or the "Ambushed by [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)" section. You choose which one.

The Characters Are Searching The characters might pursue [Brother Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) and [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md), in the hopes of rescuing [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md), who is a prisoner aboard their infernal warship. Alternatively, they might seek [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) for one of the following three reasons:

- **The Triad.** The characters may have made a bargain with the devils [Rimmon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/rimmon-coa.md), [Zagum](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zagum-coa.md), and [Buer](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/buer-coa.md) to capture [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) (see "Malsheem" in chapter 12).  
- **The Geas.** They may have allowed [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md) to place a geas upon them that compels them to slay [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) (see "Anacreda the Angelmaker" in chapter 8).  
- **The Unmaker.** They may be seeking the Unmaker if the Conclave is their patron.  

If the characters are searching for either vessel, each time they enter a new layer of the Nine Hells via the River Styx, roll a `d8`. The quarry they seek is on the layer of the Nine Hells that matches the result. Reroll the `d8` if the result matches the layer which the characters are just exiting. If the ship they seek is on the same layer as they are, then the characters need to succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to locate the target vessel or use magic to determine its location. If the characters have been told of the location of [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)'s submersible, there is no need to make this check—just pick a layer of the Nine Hells and inform the characters that is where [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) may be found.

If the characters find their desired ship, proceed to either "The Brothers' Infernal Warship" or "[Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s Infernal Submersible."

> [!note] Corruption
> 
> These encounters may trigger a premature ending to the adventure. An additional gating mechanism you might consider is to avoid triggering this hunt until the characters have become corrupted. The information in appendix E helps you keep track of their corruption. Once they've grown too corrupt, the characters are infinitely tangled in [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s chains and making a deal with the archdevil is likely their best option anyways. But if they still have a chance of redemption, they don't want to end up in Malsheem too soon.

## Ambushed by the Infernal Warship

Review the top deck (area N1), for details on the attacking force (the ship is considered to be at battle alert). Once the warship is close enough to the barge, the devils on the top deck, as well as [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md), leap onto [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge to attack the characters. If the characters fall, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) and [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) (if present) are [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) during the fight while the characters are captured and brought aboard the warship.

If the characters repel the invaders, or are captured, proceed to "The Brothers' Infernal Warship."

> [!note] Unfair Fate
> 
> If the characters are captured now, it will be challenging for them to complete any remaining quests. Use your discretion—if you don't think the characters are ready for the end stages of the plot, then don't have the Dukes find the characters just yet.
^unfair-fate

## Ambushed by Abigor

[Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s submersible is considered at battle alert when it finds [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge. The submersible surfaces and Seleceus ([pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md)) flies above the barge and begins repeatedly using its [Fireball](Mechanics/spells/fireball.md) spell against it. Their intent is to kill the characters, and swiftly. [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) himself prepares to defend the submersible if Seleceus is slain. If the characters attack the submersible, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) does everything in his power to defeat them.

If the characters are victorious and explore the ship, proceed to "[Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s Infernal Submersible."

## The Brothers' Infernal Warship

The warship is under the command of [Brother Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) and [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md).

> [!note] Warship Weapons
> 
> Each weapon requires an action to fire it and another action to reload it.
> 
> **Acidic Sprayer.** Acidic bile sprays from a nozzle in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (`9d8`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is dissolved, leaving behind any objects it was carrying or wearing.
> 
> **Flamethrower.** Fire shoots out of the weapon's nozzle in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being carried or worn.
^warship-weapons

### Encounters

The exterior of this warship is patrolled by devils, as described in area N1. Additionally other devils occupy the watchtower (area N18). Evading their notice is challenging. If the characters somehow enter the ship without being noticed, the hallways are patrolled by a pack of four [displacer fiends](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/displacer-fiend-coa.md) (see appendix B). Every minute spent in the hallways there is a 1 in 4 chance of running into them.

### Locations in The Brothers' Infernal Warship

The major locations found within the ship are described below.

#### N1: Top Deck

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The top deck of the ship is outfitted like a tribute to extremity. Ten flame throwers and ten acid sprayers line the deck in neat, alternating order, bubbling with vile green foam, or spurting out little bursts of fire, and interspersed among them are three enormous ballistae, armed with gleaming metal projectiles. At the rear of the ship, you feel the cutting heat of the furnace that powers the terrible vessel, and you hear the agonized wails of the souls being fed into it below.
^2c8

The top deck is usually crewed by a half-dozen [cambions](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md) aided by ten [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). They attack anyone that isn't a crew member. If the ship is at battle alert, then [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md) is on the top deck.

Characters might try to operate the shipboard weapons. While the great ballistae are only usable against other warships, the acid sprayers and flamethrowers can be pivoted to attack creatures on the deck (see the sidebar for details).

#### N2: Acid Vats

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A swirling morass of sizzling green acid jostles with the motions of the warship, acid occasionally sloshing almost over the lip of the vat containing it.
^2ca

These chambers are where the acid is stored that is used in the sprayers. There are ten of these acid vats, each one colored green on the accompanying map. Each vat is situated below an acid sprayer on the top deck (area N1).

#### N3: Hellfire Fuel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Hellfire in the vat before you emanates a tremendous heat even before you ever get close to it. The air above the vat shimmers, distorted by the heat and occasionally sparks erupt, landing with a sizzling hiss upon the metal floor.
^2cc

These chambers are where the fuel is stored that is used in the flame throwers. There are ten Hellfire vats, each one colored red on the accompanying map, and each situated below a flame thrower on the top deck (area N1).

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/181-0.webp#gallery)

#### N4: Command and Navigation Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The room is cramped and dark, with most of the space being taken up by a massive chair and an equally oversized wheel. The chair and wheel face the only windows in the room, toward the bow of the ship.
^2ce

[Brother Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) can often be found here. He is usually only accompanied by three [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) that he uses to send messages to other parts of the ship.

##### Treasure

There are a half dozen steel chests in this room. Each is locked and requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to unlock. Five of the chests contain platinum bars, each worth 1,000 gp. Each chest has 5 bars stacked inside of it.

The last chest contains plans written by [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) himself. The plans detail how he intends to trick [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) into leaving his plane so that he can turn him back into the slug form that [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) so despises. He has ordered the archdevil brothers to find [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s trusted lieutenant, and take him prisoner to draw [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) out. This is the same plan that the Triad will offer the characters (see chapter 12).

#### N5: Brig

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room, near the front of the lowest level of the warship, is blocked by a solid metal door. From behind the door, you hear muttering and complaining. On a hook beside the door hangs a blackened key.
^2d1

The rooms are used for disobedient crew members and prisoners of war. Unlocking the door with the key makes a loud screeching noise and by the time the door is fully opened, the prisoners beyond are already standing and looking expectantly at the door. There are currently four prisoners being held in separate cells—a [cambion](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md) named Shlatchel, a [bearded devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md), a [couatl](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/couatl.md) that has assumed the form of a cambion to avoid conflict with his cell mates (though all other crew members know the truth) and the former Hellrider, [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md) (see appendix C).

The key that opened the outer door also opens any of the cells. When [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md) sees the characters, he approaches the bars of his prison.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The aasimar before you glows with what can only be described as a divine radiance. Despite his captivity and the wounds inflicted upon him, his grin is joyous. When he speaks, his voice rings with certain truth. "It was [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md), my long-ago friend, that has sent you? He and the Hellriders?"
^2d2

[Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md) insists on freeing the other prisoners (even though he doesn't know that there is a couatl here). He feels all of them have served enough time aboard this infernal vessel already. Once [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md) is restored, the characters may use the ritual that the Hellriders taught them to free him from the Nine Hells.

#### N6: Nest

This is where the brothers keep their [vorvolakas](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/vorvolaka-coa.md) (see appendix B). There are three to be found here unless the ship is at battle alert, whereupon the room is empty.

#### N7: Engine Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The engine seems almost like a living thing. It purrs, a deep rattling, rumbling sound, and the sharp, heavy heat that comes off it pulses like a giant's breath. Lemures slink about the room, tending to its needs. Among them stalks a hulking brute with tall, curved horns, snarling at the lemures and watching with gleeful satisfaction as the door to the engine chamber is opened and soul coins are thrown into the mouth of the beast. The souls shriek and scream as they're consumed by the red-hot flames within, their torment fuel for the engine's endless hunger.
^2d5

The [horned devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) is called Coal Heart (he keeps his real name to himself) and does his job with a great deal of relish. A dozen [lemures](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lemure.md) work for him and sometimes, when he's bored, he'll throw one of them into the furnace. Coal Heart is a favorite of [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md) and there is a 1 in 4 chance that the archdevil is making his way to the engine room to spend time with his favorite subordinate.

Anyone entering the furnace (or starting their turn in it) must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) fire damage and 17 (`5d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Both Coal Heart and [Brother Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md) attempt to grapple an enemy to drag them into the furnace if combat occurs here.

![The brothers' infernal warship sails the Styx.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/183-0.webp#center)

#### N8: Kitchens

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dozen or so tieflings toil over vast pots of lumpy, bubbling goo, their shoulders slumped and eyes half closed in exhaustion. Imps dart around underfoot, taking away bowls full of squirming muck and dashing off with them to the mess hall. The air in the kitchens is stifling hot with a putrid smell that stings the eyes.
^2d7

The tieflings ([commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) have no loyalty to the Brother archdevils. They're willing to tell intruders everything they know, as long as none of the imps are around to rat them out.

#### N9: Mess Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There are several long tables in the mess hall, all of them lined on both sides with an assortment of rickety chairs and sagging benches. Tieflings, cambion devils, and bearded devils can be found sitting, standing, and slouching around the tables, shoveling unidentifiable clumps of food into their mouths with joyless abandon. Imps come in and toss more bowls of vile sustenance down the tables and take away the empty dishes and unused utensils as they leave.
^2d9

There are usually three or four each of tieflings ([bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)), [cambions](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md) and [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). There are several smaller mess halls along the lower deck, but each only contain one or two occupants at any time.

#### N10: Common Quarters

There are numerous identical crew quarters throughout the lowest level of the warship.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The bunk room is cramped, dark, and smells vaguely like fish and a great deal like rotting flesh. The bunks are packed together so tightly they might as well be one unit. There are no mattresses, just stretched canvas cots with a layer of ragged, suspiciously stained blankets tangled together on top.
^2db

##### Treasure

Searching any of these rooms usually nets `1d10` gp and `1d4` pp. There is a 10 percent chance that `1d4` [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md) return to their quarters during the characters' search. They won't engage but run to area N4 to alert the rest of the ship.

#### N11: Officer's Quarters

Below-decks there are 6 almost identical officer's quarters.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There are two beds in these small quarters. A taste of sulfur lingers in the air.
^2de

##### Treasure

Similar to the common quarters, but a search reveals `1d10` pp and `1d4` gems worth 50 gp each.

#### N12: Workshop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Approaching the workshop, you're assaulted by a vicious cacophony of awful noises. Within the large, overheated room you find several devils making repairs on a variety of weaponry and metal machinery. The sound of hammering and metal striking metal reverberates harshly off the steel walls, creating an agonizing and unending echo.
^2e1

A [maelephant nomad](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-nomad-coa.md) (see appendix B) named Zerkosis runs this workshop. It is assisted by four [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) and four [barbed devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md).

#### N13: Storage

The various storage rooms are filled with rations for the crew.

#### N14: Soul Fire Engine

This is the engine that powers the ship. Anyone entering the engine area (or starting their turn in it) must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) fire damage and 17 (`5d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### N15: Fuel Reserve

This reserve of fuel is used to power the ship if the usual soul fuel is unavailable.

#### N16: Armory

The armory is filled with weapons of almost every kind. In addition, there are two magic weapons—a [Stygian Spear](Mechanics/items/stygian-spear-coa.md) and a [Demonbone Polearm](Mechanics/items/demonbone-polearm-coa.md) (see appendix D).

#### N17: Kennels

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room apparently has no means of illumination. At the far end, in the shadows, rest several bulky, lion-like forms. The air around them seems to waver as if there were a disturbance near the creatures. You find it hard to concentrate on them.
^2e7

This is where the [displacer fiends](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/displacer-fiend-coa.md) (see appendix B) are kenneled. There are six of them here resting at any given time.

#### N18: Watchtower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Near the rear, a metal-clad tower rises over the bulk of the warship, red-hued windows offering a full view of the ship's deck as well as the river all around it.
^2e9

At any given time, four [cambions](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md) are on watch, observing the cardinal directions for signs of other vessels approaching. If a vessel is spotted, or if intruders enter the watchtower, one of the cambions attempts to flee to warn the Brothers.

#### Brothers Adramalech and Morax

[Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) seldom deigns to wield the whip himself when someone rouses his ire. He has lesser devils to do that for him. Though, in this case, 'lesser' can still mean very powerful indeed. Adramalech and Morax have served the greatest of Fiends faithfully since the earliest days of the Nine Hells. They were angels within the host [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) commanded. When he fell, they cast themselves willingly down to be with him. In an internal hierarchy rife with ambition and betrayal, the brothers' lawful nature manifests as absolute loyalty. In return, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) gives them what they want. They stand outside the intricate hierarchies of the Nine Hells, reporting directly to him and undertaking his commands with their own hands, his personal enforcers. His 'hounds', say other devils with a sneer of contempt, but Adramalech and Morax are as content with their lot as any devil can be.

They manifest most often as chalky white humanoids, Adramalech around eight feet tall and the hulking Morax, twelve. Morax is the more physically potent of the two, his hide spined and barbed, his hands jagged talons. Adramalech does most of the talking, to dreadful effect. As befits [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s devils-of-all-work, they're a versatile pair of monsters, more than equipped to punish those who have disappointed their master. And 'punish' is the operative term. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) dispatches his enemies to them when they've roused his personal ire.

[Morax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-morax-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) has the tremendous strength and speed one would expect of a martial devil. His spines are brittle and hollow, and shards of them lodge in the flesh of those he strikes, or who strike him, where they rapidly begin to grow jagged extrusions of their own like miniature sea urchins. The shards must be cut out swiftly before they carve his victims up from the inside. This is mostly by way of a distraction so that [Adramalech](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-adramalech-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) can play his own games though.

Adramalech retains his angelic voice from before the fall. His golden words inveigle their way into the ears of listeners, confusing, distracting, distorting the way they see the world and causing mind-wrenching dissonance in mortal minds. Worse than this, Adramalech can conjure simulacra of his enemies' loved ones, living or dead. More than mere illusions, these creations have a temporary life and thought drawn from the memories of the brothers' enemies. This psychic link means that, when Adramalech torments them or Morax tears them apart, the pain is felt by those whose minds gave rise to them. In this way, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s decreed punishments combine physical agony and mental trauma in equal measure.

Though concentrating on destroying the less imposing Adramalech might seem the logical way to assault the brothers, the pair have a final surprise for their foes. They were as close as two angels could get before the fall and nothing in all the eternal ages of the Nine Hells has ever divided them. If either falls while the other still stands, the remaining Brother's presence sets their fallen kin's flesh bubbling in a frenzy of regeneration. They must be defeated together or not at all.

## Baalzebul's Infernal Submersible

The submersible is commanded by [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md).

![Baalzebul's infernal subme...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/188-0.webp#center "Baalzebul's infernal submersible emerges from the Styx.")

> [!gallery]

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/190-0.webp#gallery)

### Baalzebul's Infernal Submersible Locations

The major locations found within the submersible are described below.

#### B1: Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The long hallway of the bridge is eerily silent. You hear the steady rush of water outside the submersible as the vessel cuts through the river, but inside it is still and dark. The brightest light comes from the words writ in fire on the walls, that flash briefly and then vanish. A long metal device hangs from the ceiling in the center of the room, with handles on the sides and small windows for the eyes.
^2ee

The bridge is always crewed by a half-dozen [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md). There is a 50 percent chance that the commander on deck is [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), otherwise it is the first mate, a [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) named Seleceus. If the submersible is currently at battle footing, then [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) is in command. The words on the wall are written in Infernal and are how the aboleth in area B3 communicates with the bridge commander.

#### B2: Brig

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small room appears to usually be used for storage, but manacles have been bolted to the wall and a tiefling sits in a comfy chair beside them. There's a plate of food in his lap and a half full bottle of wine beside the chair. A small satchel sits under the chair. As he hears you enter, he looks up, licks his fingers, and smiles. "More guests of our superb host, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)? I'll wager a soul coin, that you are here to rescue me."
^2f0

The prisoner is named [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) (see his entry in appendix C). The moment he walks free of the room with the characters, he holds out his hand for the coin he has won from them (he did win the wager after all). His satchel contains two [Soul Coins](Mechanics/items/soul-coin-coa.md), 15 gp, and a set of gambler's dice.

##### The Conclave as Patron

If the characters are working for the Conclave, [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) is the Unmaker. To fulfill their patron's objective, the characters must capture and destroy [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md)'s soul. [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) knows nothing of this: as far as he is concerned, he's just a fairly lucky (albeit compulsive) gambler making his way through life. Despite his ignorance, [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md), and the protection being the Unmaker provides, isn't going to make this grim task easy for the characters. The following describes what the characters might learn from [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md), or how he might react depending on how they interact with him:

- **The Manacles.** If asked why he's not chained up, he merely shrugs and says he made a bet with the guards and he won. He'll raise the plate of food and declare, "That's how I got this as well." However, if the characters appear to be dangerous to him, he lies instead and insists that there was another prisoner here, "A really bad fellow; they just dragged him off, that-away." If they leave, he attempts to hide from them in the submersible.  
- **The Unmaker.** If asked about being the Unmaker, [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) (truthfully) has no idea what the characters are talking about. The reality is that [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)—and perhaps other archdevils—would like to use the Unmaker to set the stage for a wager of divine proportions, one that will leave the world permanently changed and possibly irrevocably broken. Though [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) himself is innocent in this future wrongdoing, his soul is simply too dangerous to be allowed to exist.  
- **If Attacked.** [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) tries to talk his way out of conflict, and if that fails, he flees. If slain, the characters have 1 minute to use the Conclave Coin to capture [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md)'s soul, otherwise the Unmaker is reborn in the next generation and the threat returns (the characters fail their patron, who no longer provides additional support, other than [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s services).  

Ultimately the characters must slay [Aeshma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/aeshma-coa.md) and capture his soul with the Conclave Coin. Once accomplished, they can bring the coin with them to their final meeting with their patrons (see "A Thankful Patron" in chapter 10). Clever characters might instead destroy the coin now, ensuring that the soul doesn't fall into the wrong hands. An infernal ship's furnace consumes the Conclave Coin instantly and destroys the coin in the process. The soul trapped in the coin becomes trapped in the furnace instead, powering the infernal ship. Not even divine intervention can restore a soul destroyed in this manner.

#### B3: Communication Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is an immense tank filled with water in the center of the room. A grotesque creature with countless tentacles swims in it. The creature uses its many limbs to touch the infernal sigils carved into the wide wall in front of it with careful intention, leaving streaks of slime in its wake.
^2f3

The tentacled creature is an [aboleth](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) that was imprisoned by [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) centuries ago. It now serves the purpose of keeping [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) in communication with everyone on the ship and its other servants throughout the Nine Hells. The aboleth uses the sigils to send messages to other rooms in the submersible or receive messages from those locations. Likewise, and not unlike a [Sending Stone](Mechanics/items/sending-stones.md), some of [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)'s minions carry talismans that can send messages to this room or receive messages from it, even when they are on a different layer.

The aboleth knows many things and it is willing to share for the right price. A rare or more powerful magic item is what it wants in exchange for knowledge. It knows almost as much about the Nine Hells as [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) himself. The most important thing it knows is the truth of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s origins. You choose which of these origins is the true one:

- [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) arose from the primordial chaos as the mightiest of the lawful gods, with Jazirian the only one who could rival him. They both took the form of a serpent and they set their minds on bringing law to the chaos. Eventually the two gods fought, and [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) was defeated. His body fell through the multiverse until it crashed into Nessus forming the canyon known as the Serpent's Coil.  
- [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) is a fallen angel. He was originally tasked with keeping the demons of the Abyss in check, but eventually to become better at killing demons he and his angelic followers took on demonic traits. This led to him being banished by the gods. But before he was exiled to the Nine Hells, he was able to fool the gods into signing the Pact Primeval. This is a contract between [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and the gods of the multiverse that allows [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and his servants to legally corrupt mortal souls so that they end up in the Nine Hells. These souls can then be used to increase [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s power.  
- [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) served the first and most powerful god, He Who Was. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) chaffed at having a master, so he used an artifact called the Shard of Evil to kill his god. Then he was able to erase the name of the god from existence. The Shard of Evil is the ruby at the tip of the rod that is [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s signet. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) was banished to the Nine Hells by the other gods.  

##### Betraying Baalzebul

If the characters are working with the Triad to trick [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) into reverting to his slug form again, they can ask the aboleth to summon the archdevil here. The aboleth does this only if [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) is [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or dead and the characters must agree to cede control of the submersible to the aboleth afterwards. For the ruse to work, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) must be convinced to leave Maladomini. If the submersible is currently on the River Styx in Maladomini, the aboleth is able to navigate the vessel to the layer above or below this one before contacting [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md).

Once the aboleth summons [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), proceed to the "Capturing [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)" section at the end of this chapter.

#### B4: Engine Room

This is a Hellfire furnace. Anyone entering the furnace (or starting their turn in it) must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) fire damage and 17 (`5d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### B5: Kitchens

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The kitchen staff, a handful of wretched imps, work quickly and with stern silence. They don't speak to each other, nor make any noise at all. There are towels on their cutting boards so that their knives won't make a sound as they slice through hunks of unidentifiable meat-like substance, and they stir tall pots of frothing gruel slowly, taking care not to strike the metal sides with the stirring utensil.
^2f7

The six imps flee from any intruders, looking to alert the rest of the ship.

#### B6: Showers

There are four rooms dedicated to bathing or showering, along with toilet facilities. These are often empty.

#### B7: Common Quarters

There are two large rooms dedicated to housing and feeding the crew.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a motley collection of devils in the mess hall. Great and small figures sit silently side by side, eating spoonfuls of thick, grayish gunk. Only the slightest of slurping, chewing noises can be heard, and beneath these sounds, the distant rush of water.
^2fa

Each of the quarters contains two [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) and three [cambions](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md). If fighting occurs in one of these rooms, the occupants in the other room are likely to hear.

##### Treasure

Searching any of these rooms turns up `1d10` gp and `1d4` pp.

#### B8: Officer's Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There are three beds in this room for the submersible's officers.
^2fd

##### Treasure

Searching this room nets `8d10` pp. There is a 25 percent chance that a patrol of `1d4` [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) notice anyone looting one of these rooms.

#### B9: Storage

There are several mostly empty rooms dedicated to storing rations and nonmagical weapons.

#### B10: Abigor's Bedchamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Despite the cramped halls of the submersible, this is a reasonably sized room, with a large bed and a table with several chairs. Papers are scattered over the table.
^301

[Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) is seldom here, as there is so much work to be done in maintaining the infernal submersible. The papers mostly detail the logistics of keeping the devil crew fed and disciplined.

#### B11: Torpedo Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The room is narrow and cramped with strange equipment. There are rows and stacks of enormous metal cylinders packed into the room. Each cylinder is long and tapered, with the pointed end facing dark tunnels carved into the vessel wall that are just as wide as the cylinders themselves. Glowing infernal runes cover each of the cylinders.
^303

There are usually two [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) present, but on a battle alert the room has eight bone devils working feverishly to keep torpedoes loaded and ready to fire. There are thirty-four cylinders, each a torpedo weighing 800 pounds. They're usually inert, but if the submersible is at a battle alert, then `1d4` of them have been primed. To prime a torpedo, one must press the correct combination of runes on its surface. This requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, for each torpedo (Fiends succeed on this check automatically). If a primed torpedo takes more than 10 damage it explodes, dealing 35 (`10d6`) force damage to every object or creature within a 30-foot-radius. Any primed torpedo damaged in this way explodes too. The damage from two or more torpedoes breaches the hull of the submersible, filling the room with the waters of the Styx within `2d4` rounds.

#### B12: Depth Charge Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There are racks of metal cylinders in this room. Each is squat and thick with a tapering rear that ends in a strange round fin-like shape. Glowing infernal runes cover each of the cylinders.
^305

There are two [bone devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) present, whether or not the submersible is at a battle alert. There are ten depth charges, each weighing around 400 pounds. A depth charge must be armed before it is capable of detonating. To arm a depth charge, the correct combination of runes on its surface must be pressed, requiring a successful DC 19 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check for each depth charge (Fiends succeed on this check automatically). If an armed charge takes more than 20 damage it detonates, dealing 52 (`8d12`) lightning damage to every object or creature within a 60-foot-radius. Any armed depth charge damaged in this way detonates too. The damage from a single depth charge immediately breaches the hull of the submersible, filling the room with the waters of the Styx.

### Abigor

[Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) is [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md)'s chief general, a warlike monster fit for the violence that the Lord of Deceit considers beneath him. Its preferred shape is a flayed-looking humanoid with musculature of polished metal. Physically, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) commands tremendous strength and destructive power. Its greatest joy, however, is to command a battlefield, ordering legions of infernal troops in complex stratagems against the enemies of the Nine Hells. In times past, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) has commanded the legions of Maladomini up in Avernus to stem the tides of the Abyss. Most of the time, though, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) keeps the monstrous creature close to guard against domestic threats or punish those underlings whose construction efforts disappoint their master, as they inevitably do. [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) considers its talents wasted in such sideshows and its frustrated dreams of war manifest in counterproductive ways. Visitors sneaking through Maladomini might be surprised to find legions of devils standing about in parade ground order, or else marching and drilling, every maneuver perfect, yet their general is never satisfied. What the perfect city is to [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), military exercises are to [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md). The archdevil forces its troops to march and salute and trudge through ever more complex motions as it plays at war. Alternatively, it throws its soldiers into vast war games across the ruinous country of Maladomini, decimating its own troops just to try out some new stratagem. [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) is rightfully hated by all the devils under its command, and covertly mocked by its peers for its obsessions.

Getting close to [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) without engaging legions of infernal troops is difficult—to [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md)'s regret, in fact. Sometimes the archdevil decides to test Maladomini's security by creating openings for imaginary assassins and spies, to see who might take advantage of them. On one occasion this resulted in a determined paladin getting far too close to [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) himself, for which [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) spent some decades being whipped by infernal rust monsters. After that incident, [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) became obsessed with presenting a clean and martial appearance, employing a small legion of imps to burnish its skin to a blazing shine.

An actual physical run-in with [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) should be a simple, brutal experience but its relative isolation at the heart of Maladomini has left it curiously desperate to make the most of any fight it might get into. Rather than simply tear up the opposition, it constantly changes to more and more complex and convoluted tactics, desperate to make the very most of any melee. In doing so, it can end up missing obvious opportunities to destroy its enemies, or even inadvertently give them an advantage or let them escape. In one recorded instance, the archdevil even broke off the fight at its moment of victory to school its enemies in how they could provide a greater challenge, then insisted on beginning the fight anew.

### Assassinating Abigor

If the characters have come to slay [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) for the hag, [Anacreda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anacreda-coa.md), when the archdevil is defeated, they feel the ever-pressing weight of the geas that has bound them magically lift. They've completed their end of the bargain and are free of the hag's influence.

### Capturing Abigor

The characters don't need to keep [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) alive for the Triad's ruse to work. They simply must defeat [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md) and capture the submersible before convincing the aboleth to lure [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) into a rescue attempt. If they've done this, and the aboleth still lives, and the characters return to area B3, then read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you prepare yourself for the arrival of the archdevil, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), you watch the aboleth's slimy tentacles press against various glowing sigils. A long silence ensues, punctuated only by the occasional ping as the Styx's immeasurable pressure exerts against the submersible's metal hull. Then a sigil draws itself upon the floor, lines arcing and dovetailing, flaring bright and fading swiftly. For a moment a man with features exceedingly fine appears, in shadow, and then he shrieks, his voice deepening into a grotesque gurgle as the human-form shatters, expanding into a bulging mass of flesh, until a slug-like creature looms over you.
> 
> "W-what trickery is this?" And you recognize the voice, for you have heard it spoken from the mouth of [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) when he was possessed by [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) at the beginning of your venture. "My body... my b-beautiful body. What have you done to me?"
^309

[Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) (see appendix A) is both confused at his sudden transformation back into his most hated form and in rage at the characters. He lashes out at them. The characters can either stand to fight him or attempt to escape. In either case, they've completed the mission the Triad assigned them and if they survive here, they should return to Nessus.
