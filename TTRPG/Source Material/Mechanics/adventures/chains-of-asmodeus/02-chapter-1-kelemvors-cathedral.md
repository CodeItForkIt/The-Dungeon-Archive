# Chapter 1: Kelemvor's Cathedral
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus, p. 33* 

![The Nine Hells are no place for a paladin.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/032-0.webp#center)

Kelemvor is a god of the dead, and the cathedral dedicated to him reflects the somber nature of the god. The character's face their first challenge in this dimly-lit building.

## Running This Chapter

Before running this chapter:

- Familiarize yourself with this chapter and [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), who plays an important role in the adventure.  
- Each player must separately decide which soul they need to save from the Nine Hells.  
- As a group, the players must decide which of the group patrons they wish to ally with.  

## The Infernal Contracts

The characters meet with their group patron. They learn about [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) and how he has tricked the powerful into signing infernal contracts. They learn why their group patron is concerned about this.

Read the following text to start things off. Then read the text that is specific to the group patron.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You knew as much of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) as anyone in your line of work. He was a powerful deity, a conniving master of many schemes, and the Lord of the Nine Hells. You knew that he often plotted to corrupt and win the souls of the influential and the powerful through the use of infernal contracts, damning those unfortunates to the torments of his realm. You never thought that you would be one of his targets.
> 
> Now, you live with the loss. A hollowness exists where your soul should be, or else the fierce grief-ache of a stolen friend or family member. If [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) could not convince you yourself to sign a contract, he went after those closest to you. If you made a pact with the Lord of the Nine, you did it with the assumption that you would have enough time to fulfill your end of the bargain. Likely the others who fell prey to him thought the same. It was not to be. [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s hired murderers ensured it.
> 
> Since then, you have been searching desperately for a way to recover what you lost, without success. Every lead has turned up nothing. Every promise of a gateway into the infernal realm has been false. It has begun to seem truly hopeless... But that is about to change.
^064

### Hellriders of Elturel Introduction

The characters meet with [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) in the temple of Helm within the city of Elturel. If Elturel wasn't saved from the Nine Hells, then the meeting takes place in the city of Berdusk, one of the cities that was ruled from Elturel.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> For months, you have been searching for information about the Nine Hells and looking for allies that can help your party venture there. After hearing about the Hellriders of Elturel and their history with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), you have been granted an audience.
> 
> The temple of Helm in Elturel is a grand building of marble and gilded stone. "Heroes, well met," comes a voice from the entrance of the temple. A man in armor strides toward you. "I am [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) of the Hellriders of Elturel, and I have a proposal for you."
> 
> [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) beckons you to follow him to one of the temple walls, which bears a depiction of a great cavalry unit descending upon a gateway of flame. At the head of the painted cavalry is a winged woman in shining armor.
> 
> "In Elturel's darkest hour," [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) continues. "Our prayers were answered by the angel [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md), who led a thousand riders and a host of celestial beings into the gateway to the Nine Hells. The battle was won, the gateway destroyed, but [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md) and some of her allies were captured by the Lord of the Nine, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md) was lost. But we have learned that a few of her allies remain, held captive and tormented in the Nine Hells." The Hellrider pauses and then adds quietly, "My dearest friend among them."
> 
> [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) collects himself and says, "I propose that together you and I journey through the Nine Hells and rescue [Zariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zariel-coa.md)'s allies, my own dear friend, and the souls you yourselves have lost."
> 
> If you agree, I will take you to the temple of Kelemvor. There is a priest there who can help us."
^066

After the introductions, [Ramius](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ramius-coa.md) uses a teleportation circle to take them to the temple of Helm in Waterdeep and from there to the cathedral of Kelemvor.

### Conclave of Halruaa Introduction

The players meet [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) in Halarahh, the capital city of Halruaa.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you traverse the many market stalls of the central plaza of Halarahh, you see the shadowed pavilion described to you by your employer. Inside, [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) of the Conclave of Halruaa, a tall and slender man, wastes no time with greetings, beckoning you to follow him over to a crystal ball in the center of the pavilion. A month ago, you each received a letter from [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) inviting you to the city of Halarahh. He claimed to have a lucrative proposition for you, something that might bring back the soul that has been lost to each of you.
> 
> [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) passes a hand over the crystal ball, and suddenly you see cruel flames and strange figures moving within. "Through the power of Divination, I have discovered that the Lord of the Nine Hells, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), will very soon unleash a terrible evil, a soul that we call the Unmaker."
> 
> The flames in the crystal ball are overtaken by a pitch-black darkness. Cold eyes glare out from the void. "To prevent this disaster, you must travel to the Nine Hells, track down the Unmaker, and perform a ritual the Conclave has prepared to destroy him. To aid you in this task, we will use our powers to reveal the locations of powerful magic items hidden throughout the Nine Hells."
> 
> The crystal ball shows a series of objects wreathed in fire: a staff, a harp, a cloak, and a sword, among others. "The Nine Hells are full of dangers," [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) says gravely. "And you know well the conniving schemes of [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). As you travel through the Nine, you may have the opportunity to restore those souls that were taken from you."
> 
> [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) passes his hand over the crystal again and the images within fade away.
> 
> "This is no easy quest, but the fate of many depends upon it. If you will come with me to the temple of Kelemvor, I have a contact there who is an expert on the Nine Hells."
^068

Once [Zythan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zythan-coa.md) has finished describing the mission, he teleports himself and the characters to the cathedral of Kelemvor in Waterdeep.

### Deathstalkers of Bhaal Introduction

The players meet [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) in Waterdeep.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> It is not the finest tavern in Waterdeep. The tabletops are grimy, the chairs a spare breath from collapse, and you've spied at least one rat scampering across the floor. But the drink is cheap, and the patrons mind their business, which is exactly what your party needs. On quiet nights like these, you each feel more keenly the ache of your losses.
> 
> Your contact in the city has set up this meeting. For months, you have all been searching for allies in your quest and for a way in to the Nine Hells. Finally, after all this time, your efforts may have been rewarded. The tavern door opens, letting in a burst of cold. Footsteps follow and come directly to your table. The footsteps belong to a man who wears the robes of a high priest, though you don't recognize the symbol of his clergy. He sits down at your table, looks at you with his gleaming eyes, and speaks.
> 
> "I am [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) Anchev, high priest of the Deathstalkers of Bhaal. On my lord god's behalf, I seek to gain leverage over the deceiver, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md), the Lord of the Nine Hells. I know that each of you has cause against [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md). I offer a mutually beneficial opportunity." There is something about [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) that tells of death and destruction. But the zeal in his eyes is entrancing.
> 
> "Throughout the Nine Hells there are many powerful and ancient artifacts that [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) values, the prized possessions of his archdevils. It is the desire of the Deathstalkers for you to steal these artifacts. For your reward, we offer the artifacts themselves, save one, to do with as you please."
> 
> "If you agree, I will take you to the temple of Kelemvor. There you will be advised on how best to traverse the Nine Hells."
^06a

After speaking with the characters, [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) takes them to the cathedral of Kelemvor in Waterdeep. If the characters inquire about the artifacts [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) mentioned, he says it doesn't matter which artifact the characters surrender to the Deathstalkers. No matter the artifact, the Deathstalkers plan to use it to gain leverage in their dealings with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md).

> [!note] Meeting the Others
> 
> At this point, just prior to heading towards the cathedral of Kelemvor, if there are souls of the damned among the characters, the patron should introduce them to the other characters.
^meeting-the-others

## The Cathedral

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cathedral of Kelemvor is bone-cold and dark. The walls and floor are black stone, and there are motifs of grinning skulls in every direction. Deep set into the floor are pools of viscous liquid, as bright and red as arterial blood. The cathedral is still and silent, but you faintly hear the distant click-clack of the bones that hang from the vaulted ceiling, knocking gently together in the musty air.
^06d

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) has been waiting for the characters to arrive. He has prepared a ritual that should tell the characters where to find their group patron's objective, along with the soul they're each searching for.

### Koh Tam

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) is an imposing figure dressed in many layers of colorful robes and heavy armor pieces. He wears a golden mask that covers the upper part of his face, set with strange green gemstones that wink and glitter like eyes in the flickering cathedral light. He carries a wooden staff with a golden hand affixed upon it. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s voice has a rasping hiss to it, like wind through skulls' teeth, but he speaks kindly and with steadfast patience.

![Koh Tam prepares his ritual.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/035-0.webp#center)

### The Possession

![The ritual begins!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/036-0.webp#center)

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s plan is to allow himself to be possessed by [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), who, owing to the divine wards provided by [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s ritual, can't tell a lie. Once he has been possessed, the characters must ask him questions.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It is true," [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) says to your party. "That among those on this mortal plane, there are none that know the Nine Hells as I do. But the Nine Hells are immense, full of countless secrets and dangers. To find that which you seek, you must consult someone with even greater expertise."
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) spreads out his arms, gesturing at the ritual he has prepared in the center of the cathedral sanctum. "I will summon for you [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), one of the archdevils of the Nine. He will possess my body and speak through me. He cannot lie, but be warned, he will use all his wit to escape your questioning or to misdirect you."
> 
> Turning from you, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) begins his ritual. He chants ancient words and lifts his wooden staff, and you feel the air in the cathedral shudder with the growing power. The liquid in the pools around you rises. Thick ribbons of bloody red swirl around [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), not touching the priest, but obscuring him from your sight as the chant reaches a crescendo.
> 
> A growl escapes [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s mouth. "The rancid stench of sinners... surrounds me. Speak to me of your sins, and swiftly, so that I might tell you what I must."
^070

Each character now has the opportunity to ask after the sins they seek. [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) refuses to answer any questions until each character admits their sins or the sins of their loved one, however. Once they've done this, [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) reveals where the soul can be found. He provides only the layer of the Nine Hells and the general location (an adventure area, district, or landmark within the layer). The players should make note of this information.

At this point, the group patron contact steps forward and asks for information specific to their objective.

#### Hellriders

If the characters chose the Hellriders as a group patron, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Poor [Barachiel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/barachiel-coa.md) is held in a moving cage upon the River Styx, a guest of the great Brothers. The unfortunate [Jenevere](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jenevere-coa.md) languishes somewhere among the broken streets of the Eye Market of Maladomini. And once-mighty [Anagwendol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/anagwendol-coa.md), captured by the great hunter himself, is at the heart of Kordichai's famed hunting grounds."
^072

#### Conclave of Halruaa

If the characters have the Conclave of Halruaa as a group patron, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "You may find the Unmaker beneath the murky waters of the River Styx. In silence, moving. In darkness, moving. Entombed in a ship that does not sail, guarded by the great and monstrous [Abigor](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/abigor-coa.md), who commanded the legions of Maladomini up in Avernus to stem the tides of the Abyss."
^074

#### Deathstalkers

If the characters followed [Sarevok](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarevok-coa.md) into the cathedral, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Five items you seek, scattered across the Nine Hells. In Minauros, search [Mammon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/mammon-coa.md)'s boggy trove. One of two you may find in Phlegethos, if you dare brave the hunting grounds of Kordichai. In Malbolge, the hag-run inn might host one of your treasures. In Stygia, explore the icy Chasm of Found Things. And in Dis, cast your gaze upon the stalls and palace halls of the agora."
^076

### The Exorcism

Once [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) has answered, things go wrong:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) begins to tremble. His staff falls to the cathedral floor with a clatter, and his hands reach for his head. The ribbons of red liquid fall back into their pools, sending up mighty sprays of staining droplets.
> 
> "Prepare, adventurers!" [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) says with a gasp, his voice once more a dry hiss instead of the archdevil's terrible growl. "He is attempting to escape the confines of my body. You must exorcise him back to the Nine Hells!"
> 
> The priest's voice is suddenly overcome with ugly, booming laughter as an avatar of the archdevil begins to appear, rising out of [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s shaking form.
^078

The characters must now exorcise [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) from [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md). This is a two-stage battle. In the first stage, they must defeat the [avatar of Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/avatar-of-baalzebul-coa.md) (see the accompanying stat block) that has partially crawled out of [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md).

![Battling the avatar.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/037-0.webp#center)

Once the avatar has been defeated, the second stage begins. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) (see appendix C) is possessed and attacks. The characters must free him by casting a Dispel Evil and Good or [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell on him, or by dealing radiant damage to him. Feel free to allow other strategies to work if they make sense to the situation. A cleric's Divine Intervention, for example, banishes [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) back to the Nine Hells immediately.

Once the characters rid [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) of the avatar of [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md), the threat is ended.

## Entering the Nine Hells

Once the threat posed by [Baalzebul](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-coa.md) has been dealt with, [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) takes a little time to recover and then talks to the characters about the next steps.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The weary priest sits on the steps below the cathedral altar. His hands still tremble but his voice is calm and steady as he explains the journey that lies ahead.
> 
> "I can open a portal to Avernus, the first of the Nine Hells. Once there, I have a barge that will allow us to sail the River Styx, a far easier task than attempting to navigate by foot. I will sail with you and be your guide," [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) says. "To succeed in your mission, you must do two things. First, you must find the souls you seek and free them from whatever foul device holds them captive. Second, you must deal with [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) himself. For even if you escape the Nine Hells with the souls you wish to rescue, they will only be hunted down again unless you can convince, or trick, [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) to declare them free."
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) stands and dusts off his heavy robes. "I will go and prepare for our journey," he says. "When you are ready, come find me and I will open the portal."
^07a

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) waits for as long as the characters need. Once they're ready, he opens the portal to Avernus.

## Meeting Tiax

The portal takes [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) and the characters to the Bronze Citadel in Avernus.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The heat that greets you on the other side of the portal is at once sharp and searing and unbearably heavy, each push forward as difficult as swimming through molasses. The air is so dry that after a single breath your throat aches for drink and yet so humid that your clothes already cling to your sweat-soaked form. Above you the sunless sky is a brilliant red, alive with writhing masses of crimson clouds and flares of orange lightning. Your party stands on a rocky cliffside. Below you the dark and trepid River Styx stretches out to the ends of the horizon. All around you loom towers and walls of glinting metal and bleached bone: the Bronze Citadel.
^07c

[Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) guides the characters away from the Bronze Citadel to the docks. There he introduces them to his first mate, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) (see appendix C).

![The gate to the Nine Hells opens.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/CoA/039-0.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s first mate is a gnome of peculiar mannerism by the name of [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md). He is dressed like a naval captain that has fallen upon hard times. His face is covered by a wild beard and a wooden pipe held between his teeth sends out plumes of foul-smelling smoke. He stands on the docks by [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge, arms crossed and face set in a scowl as you approach.
> 
> "There ye are, ye fools!" [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) slams a foot down on the edge of the barge. The force pushes the vessel out to the end of its rope, leaving the gnome unbalanced and tipping toward the unnatural river water. [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) reaches out and snatches the back of [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md)'s shirt, pulling him to safety. The gnome neither offers his thanks nor pauses his speech. Instead, he stomps his foot again, this time on the firm wood of the dock, raises his fist, and says, "So, you wish to sail the treacherous waters of the Nine Hells with the mighty sorcerer [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md). Well! No better choice of guide could you have made. For the great and wise [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) knows all! But, beware, for the way before ye is full of horrors that would drive lesser souls to terror. Not I though," he says, crossing his arms again. "I'm frightened of nothing."
^07d

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is a cleric of Cyric, the god of lies. He believes that his god has chosen him to one day rule Faerûn. Over the years this preposterous belief has led to imprisonment half a dozen times, usually when one of his schemes blows up in his face (often literally). However, Cyric does indeed favor him and treats him like a pet or jester. Thus, the god always helps the gnome escape from whatever predicament he has brought down on himself.

Cyric has directed [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) to serve [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) faithfully. Cyric is interested in what [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md) has planned and harbors a deep hatred for [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s god, Kelemvor. He hopes that [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) might learn something about [Asmodeus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/asmodeus-coa.md)'s schemes and if not, then [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is well positioned to kill one of Kelemvor's most powerful clerics.

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) hides his faith from everyone. He proclaims himself a great sorcerer so that any magic he uses isn't thought of as divinely given. [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is a ticking time bomb and as the characters travel deeper into the Nine Hells he becomes more dangerous. [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) will randomly appear to help—or hinder—the characters as they make their way through the Nine Hells. Every time the characters arrive at a layer of the Nine Hells, even if they've previously visited it, roll on the Troubles with [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) table and run the indicated event.

Eventually [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) will betray [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) at the Falls of the Frozen Titan in Cania. See the "Tiax's Betrayal" section in chapter 10 for more details.

^troubles-with-tiax

### Nothing Unusual Happens

Events in this layer proceed as normal with [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md) being the primary contact.

### The Group Patron Checks In

The group patron is waiting for the characters, offering assistance as is described in their individual "As a Contact" sections from the Introduction. If this is their first time in this layer, the patron can serve the role—and read the appropriate descriptive text—that is indicated for [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md).

### "Tiax Always Knows Best!"

If this is their first time in this layer, [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) serves as guide instead of [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), insisting that he has far more insight into this part of the Nine Hells. Unlike [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md), he'll try to accompany the characters to each location they visit within the layer.

### Tiax's Shady Dealings

As the characters leave their first area within this layer (or at another opportune time), they notice [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) trying to hide (poorly) as he spies on them. If confronted, he declares, "[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) the Mighty was just making certain that his minions were behaving. Now get back to work!" If this event is rolled a second time, run the "Do Not Question [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) the Mighty!" event instead.

### "Do Not Question Tiax the Mighty!"

[Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) is temperamental. Roll a `d10` (+ the number representing their current layer of the Nine Hells) every time the characters ask [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) for advice or enter a new location. On any result lower than a 10, he is helpful. If a 10 or higher is rolled he becomes angry and stomps back to the ship. Each time he becomes angry in this way, add 1 to the next time you make this `d10` roll.

## No Turning Back

Having met [Tiax](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tiax-coa.md) and boarded [Koh Tam](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/koh-tam-coa.md)'s barge the characters are ready for their adventure to begin. Proceed to "The Bronze Citadel" section in chapter 3.
