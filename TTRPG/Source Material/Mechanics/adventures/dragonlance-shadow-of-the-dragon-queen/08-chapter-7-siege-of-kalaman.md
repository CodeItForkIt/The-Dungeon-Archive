# Chapter 7: Siege of Kalaman
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 161* 

The Red Dragon Army has failed to raise the City of Lost Names into the heavens. The characters have deprived the Dragon Army of its city-sized battle platform, but as the smoke clears, a citadel flies free of the ruins, its course set for Kalaman.

![With its flying citadel lo...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/111-07-001.chapter-splash.webp#center "With its flying citadel looming overhead, the Dragon Army prepares to lay siege to the city of Kalaman")

## Running This Chapter

This chapter opens in the aftermath of the destruction of the City of Lost Names. The characters must make haste to prepare the people of Kalaman for the flying citadel's threat. A ship at the eastern coast of the Northern Wastes can swiftly sail them to the city—but first they have to reach the coast.

When the characters return to Kalaman, they apprise the city's leaders of the threat and help prepare for the coming siege. The characters have their hands full keeping Kalaman's people safe while taking the fight to the Dragon Army. With their allies' aid, the characters infiltrate the flying citadel and bring it down from within. Finally, the characters must face the Highmaster of the Red Dragon Army, [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) herself.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- Characters begin this chapter at 10th level, having gained a level at the end of chapter 6.  
- They advance to 11th level after completing the "Flight of the Dragonnels" section and reaching the flying citadel.  

## A Hasty Retreat

While the Red Dragon Army recovers from the destruction of the City of Lost Names, [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) and the troops from Kalaman retreat and make camp a safe distance away. Begin this chapter as the characters join them by reading the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Kalaman's surviving soldiers made camp on a bluff east of the City of Lost Names—or what remains of it. In the distance, a constellation of rocks floats in the air, some the size of islands, others little more than boulders. However, the largest island advances south from the ruins, positioning itself above the reassembling Dragon Army forces. The island holds aloft a sinister temple with otherworldly violet light gleaming from its cracked walls. Its exposed foundations crawl with creatures of blackened bone and violet flame. As you watch, several of these skeletal dragons spread tattered wings, lurching into the sky to circle the citadel like gigantic vultures.
^3ec

Characters who watch the flying citadel for ten minutes or more see dragonnels moving troops from the ground to the citadel. The flying citadel gives the Dragon Army a powerful weapon, but it will take it days to move all of its forces aboard.

The flying citadel and the Dragon Army aren't immediate threats so long as the characters and Kalaman's forces keep their distance. If the characters draw near, they attract the attention of one or more [lesser death dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) that attack until the characters retreat.

### Shadow of the Citadel

After the characters see the flying citadel, Darrett seeks them out. If they haven't already told him of their time in the City of Lost Names, he asks what occurred, anxious to learn about this new threat on the horizon. After the characters share what they know, Darrett relates the following information:

- Kalaman's troops aren't in any state to take on this flying citadel.  
- Darrett suggests the characters hasten to Kalaman to apprise Marshal Vendri of this threat.  
- Darrett sent word to the transports that ferried the group to the region to relocate. They should be waiting at Dread Wolf Cove to the east (location J on map 5.1).  
- Darrett urges allies of the characters, like Cudgel and Rookledust, to go with them to help support their report to Kalaman's leaders.  
- Darrett will stay and lead the troops back himself.  

Darrett encourages the characters to rest, then set off for the coast as soon as they're ready. If [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) (see chapter 5) is with Darrett's troops, he can guide them, hastening the characters' journey.

![Darrett Highwater Wearing Solamnic Armor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/112-07-002.darrett-highwater.webp#center)

### To the Coast

The journey to Dread Wolf Cove takes five days—fewer if the characters have [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md)'s guidance or other methods of conveyance. Consult the "Movement in the Wastes" section in chapter 5 for details on moving through the region, but play the trek briskly; reporting to Kalaman about the flying citadel should feel like a race against time. If you wish, run one or more random encounters from chapter 5 during the journey. Shortly before the characters reach the cove, run the following encounter.

#### Dragonnel Down

When the characters are about a day from reaching the Kalaman ships at the coast, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three crimson dragonnels appear in the sky bearing riders in Dragon Army armor. They pursue a fourth dragonnel, but this one has no rider, and its scales are of a coppery hue. A Dragon Army rider whips a net at their desperately fleeing quarry, and the unfortunate creature tumbles from the sky, crashing near you.
^3f0

The injured [wasteland dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) crashes to the ground 30 feet from the characters. It has 4 hit points remaining and is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by a net. The three [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) and their [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) land nearby. They approach the injured dragonnel, planning to capture it and train it to serve as a mount. If the characters interfere, the Dragon Army troops attack them. The Dragon Army dragonnels flee if their riders are defeated.

##### Wasteland Dragonnel

The coppery dragonnel is entangled in a net. A character who warily approaches the dragonnel can remove the net by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. If the net is removed, the dragonnel locks eyes with whoever aided it, then clumsily flies away to the south.

### Supply Camp

The characters find the Kalaman ships at Dread Wolf Cove. If the characters didn't already venture here in chapter 5, they find it as detailed there. The shore near the vessels is guarded by a small camp of Kalaman soldiers. One of the ship captains, a human man named Haldri Leddis, recognizes the characters and prepares a ship for their journey back to Kalaman. The other vessels wait here for Darrett and his troops.

If [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) is with the characters, he bids the characters a fond farewell. He tells them he intends to return to Heart's Hollow, but he promises to send word if he finds a way to further aid them.

The characters' ship departs whenever they're ready. Thanks to strong winds in their favor, the voyage back to Kalaman takes only one day.

## Return to Kalaman

When the characters reach Kalaman, the city looks much as they left it, but tension fills the streets. The Red Dragon Army has claimed much of the surrounding lands, and the city's forces have been locked in skirmish after skirmish.

If the characters don't go directly to Castle Kalaman to report to Marshal Vendri, one of her aides finds them within a few hours of their return and escorts them to the council chamber in the castle.

### Grim Report

When the characters return to Castle Kalaman, Marshal Vendri is in a meeting with the city's newly elected leader, Governor Fuline Thren. However, the marshal has left standing orders to interrupt her if news comes from Darrett's forces. When her aide leads the characters into the castle's council chamber, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This familiar conference hall and its large round table have seen significant repairs since last you were here. Marshal Vendri and Lord Bakaris sit at the table, along with various bickering strangers who wear the colors of Kalaman guilds. Opposite the door, a woman in simple clothes sits in the governor's chair, watching the proceedings with uncertainty.
> 
> Marshal Vendri sees you and stands, surprise clear on her face.
^3f5

Vendri calls for silence and welcomes the characters. Unless they recently contacted her via the [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) spell or similar magic, she had thought they were lost. She's eager to hear their private report on what happened in the Northern Wastes.

Before Vendri can leave with the characters, though, Lord Bakaris demands the entire council hear whatever news they bring. Governor Thren hesitantly agrees, and Vendri reluctantly gestures for the characters to report. As the characters tell their story, consider interjecting criticism from Lord Bakaris or support from Marshal Vendri.

Any mention of the flying citadel captures the room's attention. Vendri, Thren, and others in the room pose the following questions:

- How many flying citadels does the enemy have?  
- Could the enemy make more?  
- How does the citadel fly?  
- Where is it headed?  
- How can it be destroyed?  
- How can Kalaman stand against a fortress that soars over the city's defenses?  

The characters are unlikely to have answers to all these questions, and Marshal Vendri doesn't expect them to, but the council grows more anxious with each unanswered question.

When the characters have answered what they can, Vendri bids them rest. The characters' quarters in the castle remain at their disposal.

### Quiet Time

After finishing their report to Kalaman's leaders, the characters are free to spend the following days as they please. The Dragon Army will need at least a week to prepare its full force to march on Kalaman, so there's plenty of time for the characters to make final arrangements in and around the city. Encourage them to tie up any loose ends, as they'll have few opportunities once the Dragon Army attacks.

Kalaman remains as described in chapter 4, though rumors of a flying war machine now flood the streets, and there's a feeling of imminent crisis.

#### Meeting with the Marshal

If the characters seek out Marshal Vendri for further conversation, she's pleased to see them. Vendri shares that the war hasn't gone well in their absence. Kalaman's forces have held their own, but the Dragon Army has claimed much of the surrounding land. The enemy has conspicuously avoided Kalaman, and the bulk of its forces are camped near the ruins of Vogler, as if waiting for something. With the news of the flying citadel, Vendri now knows why. She has ordered all troops to return to Kalaman and shore up the defenses along the walls. However, she admits the city has little hope of defeating a flying fortress.

## Day of Dread

When you're ready to proceed with this section, the characters hear a commotion in Castle Kalaman or the city streets. Scouts have returned to the city with news: A flying citadel has been spotted to the northwest of the city. Beneath it, the Red Dragon Army has begun to march toward Kalaman.

This news ushers in an uneasy day of waiting as the city braces for battle. As the day progresses, run the following encounters, using the Dread in the Streets table to set the mood as the characters venture across the city.

**Dread in the Streets**

`dice: [](08-chapter-7-siege-of-kalaman.md#^dread-in-the-streets)`

| dice: d6 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A makeshift aid camp has taken over an alley, providing help to refugees recently arrived in the city. |
| 2 | A baker stands outside their bakery, handing out free bread to all passersby. |
| 3 | A lost child calls for their parents on a crowded street. |
| 4 | A sign hangs over a blacksmith shop: "Weapons out of stock. Sorry and good luck." |
| 5 | An old man with a pointed green hat sits on a bench, telling a group of children a story of the heroic knight Huma Dragonbane. |
| 6 | A person pulling a small wagon full of stray pets stops to pick up another lost critter. |
^dread-in-the-streets

### Trouble at the Gates

A soldier discreetly seeks out the characters to report trouble at Kalaman's west Trade Gate. The soldier is concerned one of Kalaman's captains is preventing refugees from entering the city. Not wanting to make a scene or oppose a superior officer, the soldier hopes the characters can help.

If the characters follow the soldier, they find the following scene at the Trade Gate:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The portcullis of the Trade Gate has been lowered. Dozens of anxious civilians gather outside it, banging on the gate and pleading for entry. Inside the gate, Kalaman soldiers stand with spears ready, nervously eyeing the gate and their stern captain.
^3fa

The Trade Gate has been closed at the orders of Captain Oklid Narnhelm (neutral, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)). He's on the scene with his eight [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). If questioned, Narnhelm shares the following:

- Dozens of travelers and residents of the trade camps seek refuge in the city.  
- Narnhelm has heard draconians can take on the appearance of other people.  
- When large groups started showing up, Narnhelm closed the gate to prevent disguised enemies from slipping inside.  

A character can convince Narnhelm to open the gate through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If convinced, he orders the gate opened but tells his soldiers to remain on guard.

### Strange Riders

Later in the day (likely while the characters are on the streets or walls), the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score spots a dragonnel ridden by two figures flying over the city toward the spires of Castle Kalaman. At a glance, the character doesn't see any Dragon Army colors on the distant figures.

The characters can learn more about these visitors by heading to the ramparts atop Castle Kalaman. When the party arrives, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> On a broken stone buttress jutting from the ancient tower wall perches an exhausted dragonnel, its coppery scales glimmering in the sunlight. Two figures tend to the dragonnel—one in rugged leather, the other wearing the armor of a Knight of Solamnia.
^3fc

The riders are [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) and [Darrett](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md). If the characters saved the dragonnel in the "Occupied Mansion" section in chapter 6 or in the "Dragonnel Down" encounter earlier in this chapter, they recognize it as the same creature.

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and Darrett are pleased to see the characters and have the following information to share:

- Not long after parting ways with the characters, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) found this wasteland dragonnel. It was friendly and allowed [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) to ride it.  
- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and the dragonnel managed to soar close to the flying citadel.  
- Tunnels riddle the citadel's base. Eerie lights suggest they connect with the temple above.  
- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) found Darrett and offered him a ride home once the Kalaman soldiers were safely aboard the ships.  
- Several other friendly wasteland dragonnels followed [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and Darrett to Kalaman, but they broke off once the city came within sight.  

#### Planning the Counterattack

Allow the characters to use the details [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and Darrett share to concoct a plan for infiltrating the flying citadel. If they miss particulars or need ideas, Darrett makes the following suggestions:

- Facing the Undead dragons and the Dragon Army troops directly on the surface of the flying citadel would end in disaster.  
- The citadel is surrounded by flying foes, but their attention could be diverted by a distraction.  
- Using the tunnels in the citadel's foundation, a group might sneak inside and find a way to destroy the flying citadel.  
- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) might be able to find the other dragonnels in the region and bring them to aid the characters in reaching the flying citadel.  

The characters can add their own embellishments to this plan, but the flying citadel will be vulnerable only during its attack on Kalaman. The tunnels in the flying citadel's foundations are the safest path for getting inside the fortress, and "The Flying Citadel" later in this chapter assumes the characters use these tunnels.

Once the characters and their allies agree on a plan, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and his dragonnel rest briefly before heading off to find the other dragonnels and convince them to aid in Kalaman's defense.

## Night of Terror

As dusk approaches, the defenders on Kalaman's western walls sound an alarm: the Red Dragon Army and its flying citadel draw near. All of Kalaman's soldiers are called to defensive positions. When the alarms ring out, Darrett finds the characters and takes them to the Trade Gate's ramparts. When they arrive, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The west-facing ramparts of the Trade Gate are abuzz with soldiers rushing reports in and orders out. Amid the activity stands Marshal Vendri, issuing sharp commands to an endless array of lieutenants. Every so often, the marshal's gaze passes through the tangle of soldiers to the field beyond the walls.
> 
> There, thousands of soldiers in red and black raise the Dragon Army's camp beyond the reach of Kalaman's defenders. War machines roll into position between crimson banners bearing the Dragon Queen's claw-like symbol. Above, dragonnels soar in rigid formations alongside the Dragon Army's most terrifying weapon, the flying citadel. Otherworldly smokes roil from the ruined temple atop the floating island. As it drifts into place above the battlefield, reanimated corpses of ancient dragons circle the ruins, glowing with the same terrible light as the temple itself.
^3ff

Marshal Vendri can spare only a moment for the characters. She has no immediate orders but asks them to stay on hand to solve whatever emergencies are sure to arise. She doesn't expect the Dragon Army will launch a full siege tonight, but Kalaman's defenders must be prepared for anything.

If the characters and Darrett have plans for attacking the flying citadel, Vendri supports them. Use her suggestions and orders to guide the characters toward infiltrating the flying citadel once they have the help of [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md)'s dragonnels—a plan that becomes reality in the "Dragonnel Reinforcements" section.

### No Sleep in Kalaman

The people of Kalaman face a long, anxious night waiting for the Dragon Army's attack. Use encounters from the Night Encounters table to reinforce the Dragon Army's menace throughout the night. When you're ready to conclude this section, move on to the "Bakaris Defects" encounter.

**Night Encounters**

`dice: [](08-chapter-7-siege-of-kalaman.md#^night-encounters)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Six [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) scale the walls and attack a group of [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) near the characters (see appendix B for both stat blocks). |
| 2 | Four Kalaman soldiers turn on their commander—in truth, these are four [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) disguised using Shape Theft. |
| 3 | Testing the Defenses (see below) |
| 4 | Highmaster's Message (see below) |
^night-encounters

![A sivak draconian swoops down to attack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/113-07-003.sivak-draconian.webp#center)

#### Testing the Defenses

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A warning horn sounds from a group of soldiers crewing ballistae nearby. In the distance, a flight of Dragon Army dragonnels sweeps toward the city walls.
^402

Four [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) carry a total of eight [bozak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks). On the walls near the characters are three ballistae (detailed in the ""Siege Equipment"" section of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") and six [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B).

The Dragon Army dragonnels are currently 360 feet from the city. In 3 rounds they will be 20 feet above the walls, and the eight bozak draconians will recklessly glide onto the ramparts and attack.

The characters can use the ballistae to attack the approaching dragonnels. A dragonnel struck by a ballista bolt panics and retreats with its two riders.

#### Highmaster's Message

This encounter occurs while the characters are outside, possibly on Kalaman's walls or the city streets. The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score sees a strange violet light in the sky. After they react, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A violet star plummets from the sky and crashes nearby, throwing up a cloud of debris. A breathless screech rises from the black-lit dust. An instant later, blackened fangs and violet flame burst forth in the form of a massive skeletal dragon.
^404

This [lesser death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) has come specifically for the characters. After its dramatic crash landing, it starts the battle with 160 hit points and fights to the death.

During the fight, the first character to deal damage to the death dragon notices a piece of parchment is pinned to the skeleton with a dagger. When the death dragon is defeated, the characters can retrieve the parchment, which bears this message:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Dragon Queen sees you, and I am the fire in her eyes. The end comes. It is the Dragon Queen's will.
^405

The message was written by [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) specifically for the characters. There is no signature, but the wording suggests the characters have become objects of the highmaster's ire.

### Bakaris Defects

A messenger arrives, either seeking Marshal Vendri at the Trade Gate while the characters are present, or seeking the characters at Vendri's orders. The messenger reports the Warrior's Gate on the east wall is unguarded. Vendri urges the characters to quickly find out what happened.

When the characters arrive at the gate, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Warrior's Gate stands open, though its portcullis remains closed. No guards are in sight, and beside the gate, the guardroom's door is ajar.
> 
> On the other side of the portcullis, several figures wearing Dragon Army uniforms pace back and forth. As you near the gate, the portcullis begins to rise.
^407

The portcullis rises jerkily. After 3 rounds, it will be high enough to admit a group of six [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) into the city.

The characters know the portcullis's controls are in the guardroom adjacent to the gate. There they find the anxious Lord Bakaris ([noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)), accompanied by six [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) in Kalaman armor. One of the knights turns a winch, raising the portcullis outside.

Lord Bakaris is defecting to the Dragon Army and has convinced these knights to come with him. The cowardly lord is terrified of the invasion and is convinced everyone in Kalaman is about to be slaughtered. After a moment of shock at seeing the characters, he orders the five unoccupied knights to attack the characters—while trying to stay out of battle himself.

#### Portcullis

If the knight raising the portcullis isn't stopped within 3 rounds of the characters arriving at the Warrior's Gate, the Dragon Army officers join the battle and Lord Bakaris tries to flee from the city. If the characters prevent the portcullis from opening, the Dragon Army troops flee.

#### Bakaris's Defeat

Lord Bakaris panics if his escape plan falls apart. Desperate, he might try to climb over the city wall or employ another reckless scheme. He surrenders if he takes any damage or if his knights are defeated. Once Bakaris is defeated, a character who searches him finds the following message from his son:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Father, the Dragon Army sends its greetings and a proposition: Avoid the doom in store for Kalaman. Meet our agents at the Warrior's Gate. Open the way, and they'll bring you to me. I've found a place here and have been promised a share of the glories to come. You can have the same if you embrace the Dragon Queen's will.
^40b

The letter is simply signed "Bakaris." The characters will face [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) in the "Flight of the Dragonnels" section, but they have no other information about the traitor at this time.

### Concluding the Night

After running the encounters in this section, the Dragon Army's attacks cease for a time. Have Darrett or another NPC urge the characters to rest before the coming day's battles. Give characters enough time to finish a long rest before starting the next section.

## Battle of Kalaman

After a brief lull in the initial attacks on Kalaman, the Red Dragon Army unleashes its wrath on the city.

If the characters rested after the events of the previous section, their rest concludes to the sound of warning horns. Darrett or a messenger from Marshal Vendri urges them to hurry to the command post atop the Trade Gate. Once the characters arrive, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The siege of Kalaman has begun. Thousands of Dragon Army troops—humans, draconians, and other creatures—march on the city. Along the walls, Kalaman soldiers shout commands while ballistae fire in rapid percussion, their deadly bolts barely keeping the dragonnels wheeling overhead at bay. Beyond the dragonnel riders, the flying citadel looms like a thunderhead, drifting slowly but relentlessly closer.
^40e

At this point, there has been no word from [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) or the dragonnels he went to track down.

### Battle Begins

This section has no set timeline or specific goals beyond involving characters in Kalaman's desperate defense. Roll on or choose the encounters you want to run from the Defending the Wall table. These encounters are described below. Once you're ready for the characters to begin their infiltration of the flying citadel, proceed with the "Dragonnel Reinforcements" section.

**Defending the Wall**

`dice: [](08-chapter-7-siege-of-kalaman.md#^defending-the-wall)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Ballista Breakers |
| 2 | Daring Riders |
| 3 | Death Dragon Attack |
| 4 | Draconian Assassins |
^defending-the-wall

#### Ballista Breakers

A flight of dozens of sivak draconians soars from the flying citadel toward Kalaman. Many are shot down, but four [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) land on Kalaman's wall and attempt to destroy three ballistae 30 feet from the characters.

On each sivak's turn, it attacks a ballista unless the sivak was targeted before that turn by a character. A ballista is destroyed after sivaks attack it three times. If all three ballistae are destroyed, three dragonnels and their riders fly overhead, avoiding the wall's defenses. This provokes the "Daring Riders" encounter immediately after this encounter is resolved.

#### Daring Riders

Three [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) mounted on [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) manage to get past Kalaman's walls. The riders throw alchemist's fire onto the city as they circle overhead. Characters on the wall can turn a ballista to fire over the city, but doing so takes an action and a successful DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. If the ballistae near the characters have been destroyed, they can find an additional ballista 60 feet farther along the city wall.

#### Death Dragon Attack

A [lesser death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) crashes against Kalaman's wall at least 90 feet from the characters. By the time the characters draw close, the death dragon has already used its Cataclysmic Breath to kill four Kalaman soldiers, transforming them into [zombies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/zombie.md).

#### Draconian Assassins

While the characters are at the Trade Gate command post or another vulnerable point, two [aurak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) teleport nearby using the [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) spell and attack a Kalaman commander (use the [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block). This might be Marshal Vendri, Captain Narnhelm, or another Kalaman officer.

### Dragonnel Reinforcements

When you're ready for the characters to turn their focus to the flying citadel, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A scout rushes to you with a message. Only minutes ago, a small group of coppery dragonnels landed in a grove southwest of the city. They didn't look like the kind the Dragon Army flies, and only one had a rider.
^415

From this description, the characters should recognize [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) has returned with the dragonnels he sought. From here, the adventure proceeds in one of two ways:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you are using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game along with this adventure, the characters are asked to report to Marshal Vendri. She plans to have her troops take to the field, providing cover for the characters to reach the dragonnels. Consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 11" sidebar.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the "Over Enemy Lines" section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 11
> 
> Kalaman's defenders undertake an attack to distract the Dragon Army, giving the characters an opportunity to reach the dragonnels and fly to the flying citadel. Read the introduction to scenario 11 in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*, then play that scenario.
>

^warriors-of-krynn-scenario-11

#### Over Enemy Lines

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) found the dragonnels he went looking for and convinced them to follow him to Hawker's Grove, a wooded area southwest of the city. To rendezvous with [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md), the characters must reach him amid the siege. The characters might come up with their own methods, but if they ask Darrett or another ally for suggestions, they're directed to the southwest city wall where Rookledust is posted.

There, the characters find Rookledust and her new assistant, Than (introduced in chapter 3), have managed to convert a defunct catapult into a gnomeflinger (see appendix A). They created it to help get soldiers into the field or city rapidly, but thus far no commanders have incorporated the device into their strategies. The gnomes are delighted to let the characters use the gnomeflinger. They even provide each character a [narycrash](Mechanics/items/narycrash-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A)—or two, if a character asks for a backup.

Once the characters are ready, the gnomes happily launch the characters one by one from the southwest city wall and over the Dragon Army forces below. After flying several hundred feet, the characters land a short distance from the tree line and Hawker's Grove.

### Assault on Hawker's Grove

Hawker's Grove is depicted on map 7.1. As the characters near Hawker's Grove, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Kalaman's scouts weren't the only ones to notice [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and his dragonnels. The grove ahead is in flames. From amid the smoke comes the sound of bestial screeching.
^419

The [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) has taken refuge in the grove and has set up a small camp where he waits for the characters. He's accompanied by his own coppery [wasteland dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and one for each character. Just before the characters arrived, four [red dragon wyrmlings](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling.md) pursuing the dragonnels used their breath to set part of the grove aflame. The red dragons now lurk in the smoke, preparing to attack. They fight until wounded by a [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) or reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and his dragonnels stay out of battle unless attacked.

Unless the characters prepared another strategy, they begin this encounter adjacent to the tree stump at the southeast corner of the map.

The following section notes elements unique to this battle. The battle ends when the red dragons are defeated.

#### Hawker's Grove Battlefield Features

The battlefield includes the following features:

- **Burnt Ground and Trees.** This area has recently been blasted with flames. It still smolders, and smoke heavily obscures this area. The smoke disperses after 5 minutes or if exposed to wind moving at least 10 miles an hour.  
- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents areas from which dangers might appear.

#### Hawker's Grove Battlefield Events

During this battle, roll on the Hawker's Grove Battlefield Events table each round on initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table when a red dragon is slain or if a character enters the Fray or otherwise tries to leave the battlefield.

**Hawker's Grove Battlefield Events**

`dice: [](08-chapter-7-siege-of-kalaman.md#^hawkers-grove-battlefield-events)`

| dice: d10 | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1–3 | A flight of dragonnels strafes the battlefield, the wind from their passage reigniting flames in the burnt ground. Each creature in this area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 4–6 | A stray ballista bolt fires into the grove. Roll any die. On an even roll, the bolt targets a random player character. On an odd roll, the bolt targets a random red dragon. The attack has +6 to hit and deals 16 (`3d10`) piercing damage on a hit. |
| 7–8 | A [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) arrives, appearing adjacent to the Fray near a random player character. If there is already a sivak draconian in the battle, no event occurs. |
| 9–10 | One of the red dragons roars a prayer: "Dragon Queen, grant us your flames!" Each red dragon recharges their Fire Breath action. |

### Meeting with Clystran

After the red dragons are defeated, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) greets the characters and introduces them to the [wasteland dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) he has convinced to aid them. Use the following topics to guide the conversation with [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md):

- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) is eager to leave the grove before the Dragon Army attacks again.  
- He hopes the dragonnels can slip past the Dragon Army's winged forces amid the chaos.  
- He intends to lead the characters to the tunnels in the foundation of the flying citadel. He urges them not to attack during the flight or otherwise draw attention to themselves.  
- Once the characters land on the citadel, it'll be up to them to find a way to bring it down.  
- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) doesn't know how the characters will escape after destroying the flying citadel, but he promises to watch for them from a distance.  

Once [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) has answered any questions, he and the characters can mount their dragonnels and take off. The dragonnels are intelligent creatures and understand the stakes, so they allow their riders to direct their flight as long as their riders don't give life-threatening orders.

### Flight of the Dragonnels

As [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and the characters fly above the battlefield, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The clash between the Dragon Army and Kalaman's defenders rages below. The city's walls hold, though smoke rises from the bombardment of enemy war machines and dragonnels. Flights of winged enemies circle between the city and, high above, the inky shape of the flying citadel. [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) points toward the citadel and guides his mount to follow the path of a group of Dragon Army dragonnels returning from an attack.
^41e

As the characters near the flying citadel, they must succeed on a DC 14 group Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check or a flight of six [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) spots the party and approaches. If the characters have disguised themselves as Dragon Army soldiers, the dragonnels ignore them and fly on. Otherwise, the dragonnels attack. If the characters flee, the dragonnels break off after a short pursuit, but other foes notice the characters (see the following section).

#### Red Ruin

![The Dragon Army's ace drag...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/116-07-004.red-ruin.webp#center "The Dragon Army's ace dragonnel rider, Red Ruin, soars toward her target")

After the characters avoid or contend with the dragonnels, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) breaks away from the Dragon Army flight path he had been following, rushing the characters toward the base of the flying citadel. Read the following text as the characters approach:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you near the flying citadel, two shapes emerge from the dark clouds drifting in its wake. A pair of bright-red dragonnels slash through the air, their riders guiding them directly toward you.
^420

The characters are spotted while they're approximately 600 feet above the ground. Coming for them is [Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md), the Red Dragon Army's ace dragonnel rider, and [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) (a [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md)). Both are mounted on [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for all three stat blocks).

[Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md) fights to the death, but Bakaris flees if reduced to 20 hit points or fewer. If Bakaris is knocked from his mount or slain, he falls and vanishes amid the chaos.

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and his dragonnel stay out of combat.

##### Bakaris's Ego

During the battle, Bakaris removes his helmet and taunts the characters, claiming Kalaman is doomed and offering to find them jobs cleaning dragonnel stables if they surrender.

##### Falling in Battle

[Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md) seeks to knock her foes from their mounts using her Lance attack. If a rider falls from a dragonnel, the rider falls toward the ground until the end of the following round. During this time, another rider who is mounted alone on a dragonnel can use movement to dive alongside the falling creature and try to catch that creature as an action. The rider catches the falling creature on the rider's dragonnel if the rider succeeds on a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A falling creature that isn't rescued takes 70 (`20d6`) bludgeoning damage upon hitting the ground.

#### Entering the Citadel

Once Bakaris and [Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md) are defeated, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) urges the characters to follow him directly to the citadel. Other Dragon Army dragonnel riders have noticed the battle and are turning from Kalaman to investigate, but they're still minutes away.

As the characters reach the flying citadel, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The flying citadel rises upon an inverted mountain of black stone and exposed dragon bones. Fissures riddle this foundation, creating tunnels that extend deep into the rock. [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) guides his dragonnel close to one of these, a natural shelf with space enough to land. Beyond, a narrow cave cuts its way into the depths of the flying citadel.
^424

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) urges the characters to land swiftly, dismount, and head into the cave before they're spotted. He'll take their dragonnels and lead off any pursuit. He doesn't know what's in the cave beyond the landing site, but he urges the characters to move fast and stay quiet, as untold numbers of Dragon Army troops occupy the land around the Bastion of Takhisis above. Soon after, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and the dragonnels depart.

Before the characters enter the cave, have each character make an Intelligence check. The character with the highest result calculates that based on the flying citadel's current speed, at least three hours remain before the citadel reaches Kalaman's walls (at which point crashing it would destroy the city). The party shouldn't dally within the citadel, but they don't need to rush for the sake of bringing down the citadel quickly.

The tunnel here is narrow, and only Medium or smaller creatures can enter. It leads to area S1 in "The Flying Citadel."

### Character Advancement

When the characters arrive at the flying citadel, they advance to 11th level.

## The Flying Citadel

When the end came for the City of Lost Names, it came for everyone in equal measure except the followers of Chemosh, god of undeath. Chemosh's servants thrived in the ruins of the Bastion of Takhisis, Onyari's temple dedicated to forces controlled by the gods of evil. Led by the vampire Alstare Bellis, they assumed control of the temple and continued their worship. When [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) claimed the temple, he carried Cataclysmic fire into heart of the temple, suffusing it with magical power. This power now animates the death dragons and gives Soth control over the Bastion of Takhisis.

### Goals in the Citadel

It should be clear to the characters that the flying citadel must be prevented from reaching Kalaman, but they likely haven't yet determined exactly how. During their exploration of the flying citadel, characters like [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) (see area S2) and [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) (see area S22) can reveal details that help the characters devise plans aligning with the possibilities below.

#### Unseat Soth

The party's initial plan most likely hinges on destroying [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) or otherwise removing him from the citadel. Soth is the absolute commander of the Bastion of Takhisis, and defeating him would render it inert. The characters need to be ingenious, as they can't hope to beat [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) by direct confrontation.

#### Discover Lost Elven Magic

Hidden in the depths of the temple is a magic item known as the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A). It can temporarily paralyze [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and halt the citadel. Multiple people point to the mirror as crucial to Soth's downfall, but on its own, it's only a temporary solution.

#### Destroy the Citadel

Ending the magic that holds the citadel aloft means snuffing the Cataclysmic fire in the Mourning Sanctum, the heart of the citadel, or destroying the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A) it empowers. [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) will never allow this to happen, though, so he needs to be neutralized beforehand.

### Citadel Features

Maps 7.2 and 7.3 depict the flying citadel. Unless otherwise noted, the following features are consistent throughout the dungeon:

- **Corridors.** All corridors have 10-foot-high ceilings. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings.  
- **Lighting.** Except for natural chambers and areas that note otherwise, areas inside the flying citadel are dimly lit by the flickering flames of magical torches and candles.  

### Citadel Depths

The lowest levels of the flying citadel are unworked tunnels. The characters find an entrance to these depths through a fissure in the citadel's base.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.2: Flying Citadel Sublevels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/117-map-7.02-flying-citadel-sublevels.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/118-map-7.02-flying-citadel-sublevels-player.webp#gallery)

#### S1: Tunnels

As [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) departs and the characters venture into the cave tunnels, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnels leading into the foundations of the flying citadel are completely dark. Occasional rumbles echo through the passages as the citadel's foundation shifts in flight.
^42e

The tunnels are 10 feet wide, occasionally opening into larger chambers. Switchbacks, dead ends, and sloping tunnels make these passages a maze.

To navigate the tunnels to area S2 without incident, the characters must succeed on a DC 16 group Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. If more than half the characters fail the check, they find the passage leads through a 50-foot-wide, 70-foot-long, 50-foot-high cavern where a [lesser death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) lurks. It attacks when it notices the characters. Once the dragon is defeated, the characters face no more dangers in the tunnels. They eventually find a 30-foot shaft rising to area S2.

### Temple Crypts

The Bastion of Takhisis had countless enemies, many of whom were interred in the temple crypts (depicted on map 7.2). [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) pays this level of the citadel little mind, as his cursory investigation turned up little of interest. Unbeknownst to him, several free-willed Undead linger here.

#### S2: Entry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnels that wind through the foundation of the flying citadel rise via a natural shaft into this rocky cavity. A gash in the rock forms a passage to the east, where a familiar, blue-skinned elf in a pale dress stands with a knowing smile on her face.
^431

This chamber is a crooked seam in the rock. The passage to the east splits, with both routes connecting to area S3. One path enters area S3 through a broken crypt in that room's wall, while the other descends 15 feet and leads to a gouge in the floor of that area.

![Leedara](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/119-07-005.leedara.webp#center)

The elf waiting here is [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) (a neutral [ghost](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) detailed in chapter 3) in her guise as a living Silvanesti elf. She's here to aid the characters in confounding [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s plans and imparts the following information:

- [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) lurks in the ruins above. He's using the Cataclysmic fire from Kalaman's catacombs to control the flying citadel and reanimate dragon skeletons buried in the flying island's foundations.  
- If the characters can quell the Cataclysmic fire, the Undead dragons will be destroyed and the flying citadel will fall.  
- [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) isn't certain how to quell the Cataclysmic fire. The flames were created by the gods, so it stands that the power of the gods could extinguish them.  
- [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) is a peerless foe. The characters won't be able to stand against him in battle.  
- Hidden somewhere in the chambers ahead is an elven relic known as the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A). Those who view the mirror see glimpses of their past.  
- [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) believes the mirror can distract Soth, giving the characters a chance to extinguish the Cataclysmic fire.  

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) also knows [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s past and relates all the information from "Lord Soth's Curse" in chapter 4.

The characters likely have many questions about [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) herself: why she's here, how she knows so much about Soth, and so forth. If questioned, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) reveals her true, ghostly form. She explains that, in life, she was one of the elven priestess Isolde's attendants and was among those who distracted Soth from his quest to prevent the Cataclysm. For her deeds, she's cursed to live as a ghost—but she's also a curse on Soth and works to stymie his ambitions. She can't stand against Soth alone and earnestly seeks to aid the characters. After sharing the information here and answering any questions the characters have about [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), she vanishes.

During the conversation with [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md), if the characters attack or disbelieve her, the ghost vanishes, then reappears later to provide any of the information here as it proves helpful.

#### S3: Burial Vault

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Spaced evenly about the perimeter of this chamber are numerous bricked-over stone archways. Plaques are set into many of these arches. At the room's center stands a raised stone dais bearing an ominous statue. A double door, a smaller door, and a stairwell stand at the east end of the room.
^433

A fissure has opened in the wall of this vault, allowing access from area S2. Eleven sealed crypts line its walls. One crypt has been broken open, and a branch of the fissure connects it to area S2. The broken crypt bears a plaque reading "Acont, Prince of Minotaurs."

Two [skeletal knights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-knight-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and a [minotaur skeleton](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/minotaur-skeleton.md) stand guard in this room and attack intruders on sight.

##### Brickwork Seals

Each occupied crypt is bricked over. These brickwork seals are Large objects with AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

##### Crypts

Each crypt contains the remains of someone whose soul was remanded to Chemosh, God of Undeath. A simple plaque notes the occupant's identity. Use the Crypt Plaques table and Crypt Contents table to determine what the crypts' plaques say and what lies within each. If you roll the same name for a plaque more than once, the plaque is missing.

^crypt-contents

#### S4: Chemosh's Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the center of the crypt, a dais bears a statue of a robed figure with a grim skull for a face. Before the statue, a pair of skeletons kneel, holding an altar of polished black stone between them.
^437

This shrine is under the effect of a [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) spell, with the additional effect that creatures other than Undead that attempt to ascend the dais are subject to the spell's fear effect (save DC 16).

##### Chemosh's Blessing

The first character who succeeds on the saving throw against the [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) spell and approaches the skull on the shrine hears the voice of Chemosh in their mind:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I find you worthy. Join me, and I will open the River of Souls to you."
^439

If the character refuses the offer, the altar emits smoke that coalesces into a [hulking figure](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/hulking-shadow-dsotdq.md). This hostile figure uses the [clay golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md) stat block, but it is an Undead instead of a Construct. If the character accepts, they immediately become aware of how to use the altar to speak with the dead, and they don't need a holy symbol to do so.

##### Chemosh's Altar

A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of necromancy around the altar. The altar can be used to commune with the dead. If a corpse's skull is placed on the altar, a creature wearing or holding a holy symbol of Chemosh can ask the skull five questions, as if by the [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell. Each skull can be questioned only once in this way.

If the characters question a skull from area S3, it can answer little beyond general questions about the temple's layout. If asked about the treasure vault's location, one of the skulls answers, "Treasure is found when Takhisis turns her ire south."

If the skulls from areas S8 and S9 are questioned, they provide the facts detailed in those sections.

#### S5: Vestry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bare room's only adornment is a half dozen disintegrating robes hanging from pegs in the walls. A section of the wall has swung open, revealing another room once hidden behind a secret door.
^43c

The small room is strewn with shattered pottery, a broken chest of empty drawers, and a moldering pile of clothes. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check shows this room has been ransacked; the chest of drawers and pottery have been carelessly handled and the clothes tossed about.

##### Treasure

A character who searches the pile finds a [portable hole](Mechanics/items/portable-hole.md) hidden among the clothing, folded into a small triangle and tucked into the pocket of a shirt sized for a Small creature.

#### S6: Elven Catacombs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Statues adorn the north, south, and east walls. The north statue depicts an elf man reclining on a bench. The south statue depicts an elf woman doing the same—but the statue has been pushed aside, revealing an open doorway behind it. The statue to the east features a noble elf man seated on a fine chair.
^43f

The Large statues mark the entrances to the tombs of three elves: the Silvanesti ambassador Cithcillion and his companions, Madar and Tenadria. All three died as captives of the Bastion of Takhisis and were interred here so their spirits could be further interrogated using magic mirrors in their tombs.

The statue to the south has been pushed aside, revealing the entrance to a tomb behind it. Similar entrances exist behind the other statues, which can be pushed aside with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

#### S7: Madar's Tomb

The doorway to this tomb can be accessed by pushing its statue aside with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long, gray marble slab lies in the middle of this chamber. A shallow inset of similar dimensions is carved into the ceiling directly above the slab. Scattered about it are skeletal remains intermingled with shards of glass.
^441

Close inspection of the floor reveals the shards of glass are pieces of a mirror. The bones belong to Madar, one of Cithcillion's companions. Madar's bones were thrown from the marble slab when the City of Lost Names fell from the sky. The bones are now scattered and shattered beyond repair.

#### S8: Cithcillion's Tomb

The doorway to this tomb can be accessed by pushing its statue aside with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long, gray marble slab lies in the center of this chamber. Scattered around it are the skeletal remains of an elf. An inset in the ceiling above the slab holds a mirror the same size as the slab.
^443

A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals the mirror on the ceiling radiates an aura of necromancy. If the characters return Cithcillion's bones to the slab, the reflection in the mirror is of him as he was in life. His reflected image opens its eyes and speaks:

![Cithcillion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/120-07-006.cithcillion.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I am Cithcillion of Silvanost. I came here with two dear friends, Madar and Tenadria. Do you know what's become of them?"
^444

Cithcillion is aware he's dead, but he has no idea what became of his companions. The characters may realize the other tombs (areas S7 and S9) belong to Madar and Tenadria.

##### Cithcillion's Quandary

If the characters tell Cithcillion that Madar and Tenadria are also dead, his sadness is evident, and he requests the characters bring his friends' remains to his tomb so they can be reunited in death. He doesn't speak further or answer questions until the characters have done as he asks.

When Madar's and Tenadria's remains are brought to his tomb, Cithcillion is willing to talk with the characters, answering questions forthrightly. He doesn't know anything about the dungeons in which he is interred, the Cataclysm, the state of the City of Lost Names, or how much time has passed. He shares the following information with the characters:

- Cithcillion was a Silvanesti elf who, like many in Krynn, had grown concerned with the kingpriest's increasingly arrogant behavior.  
- When rumors spread of the kingpriest desecrating a dragon burial ground, Cithcillion was sent as the Silvanesti ambassador to Onyari with his friends Madar and Tenadria. They hoped to persuade the kingpriest to return the bones to their proper resting place.  
- They brought with them a gift, the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A). An elven relic used to help long-lived peoples recall happier times, the mirror was intended to help the kingpriest reflect on simpler expressions of faith and hopefully deter him from dramatic affronts to the gods.  
- Their diplomatic visit ended with Cithcillion and his friends imprisoned and dying in the temple.  
- Cithcillion doesn't know what happened to the mirror, but it's likely still in the temple somewhere.  

If the characters use the [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell on Cithcillion's skull instead of using the mirror, he gives truthful answers about the above information.

#### S9: Tenadria's Tomb

The doorway to this tomb opens to area S6, as its statue was moved before the characters arrived.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long, gray marble slab lies in the middle of this chamber, and atop it lies a Humanoid skeleton. A shallow inset of similar dimensions is carved into the ceiling directly above the slab. Shards of broken glass litter the slab and floor.
^447

Close inspection of the floor reveals the shards of glass are pieces of a shattered mirror. The skeleton on the slab belongs to Tenadria, an elf diplomat and one of Cithcillion's companions. Tenadria responds uncooperatively to the [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell.

##### Alstare Bellis

The neutral evil [vampire](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/vampire.md) and former high priest of Chemosh, Alstare Bellis, hides just above the entrance to the tomb in bat form. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the bat. If Alstare isn't detected, he waits for the characters to enter the tomb and drops behind them, changing into his Humanoid form and blocking the exit.

Alstare doesn't immediately attack the characters but instead questions them. If it becomes clear they're enemies of the Red Dragon Army, he offers a deal. In exchange for the characters destroying the draconians on the floor above—especially their gold-scaled leader (Drayan in area S12)—Alstare will reward the party with "treasures untold." Once the characters return to him with evidence they've completed this task, Alstare tells them how to access the treasure vault (area S13) using the statue in area S12.

If the characters agree to help Alstare, he also immediately shares how the altar in area S4 functions.

If refused or attacked, Alstare flees, then harasses the characters with hit-and-run tactics, seeking to make them his vampire spawn. This tomb is Alstare's resting place.

##### Alstare's Amulet

Alstare wears a medallion around his neck in the shape of a goat's skull, which he offers to loan to a character who wishes to use Chemosh's altar. A cleric of Chemosh or a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes this as a holy symbol of Chemosh, god of undeath.

### Priests' Quarters

The priests' quarters (depicted on map 7.2) are where many of the temple's faithful spent their lives. The Bastion of Takhisis's officiants and servants practiced their worship here, separate from the public spaces above. Now the draconians work feverishly to uncover its secrets while [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) looks on through his Undead servants.

#### S10: Corridors

The corridors on this level are guarded by two [skeletal knights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-knight-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). The knights guard the door to the sanctuary (area S12), and they notice anyone using the southeast stairs to area S3.

![Lorry Wanwillow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/121-07-007.lorry-wanwillow.webp#center)

#### S11: Rubble and Ruin

Rubble chokes the southern half of this room where the wall and ceiling have collapsed. A character who examines the room and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notices a set of bootprints from a Small Humanoid going north to south. At the midpoint of the room, the Humanoid tracks stop and a set of rat tracks begin, leading directly into the rubble.

##### Exploration

Though the ruined area to the south has mostly collapsed, cramped passages allow space for a Medium or smaller creature to squeeze through to Lorry's lair.

##### Lorry's Lair

Past the rubble is a ruined chamber lit by black candles surrounding an open stone coffin. The body of a female kender lies in the coffin, her features placid and her hands folded over her heart.

[Lorry Wanwillow](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lorry-wanwillow-dsotdq.md) (chaotic evil, kender [vampire](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/vampire.md); her Shapechanger trait allows her to become a rat instead of a bat) rests in the coffin. The Humanoid and rat tracks in the room to the north were both hers. She appears dead, feigning as much until the characters draw near, at which point she tries to scare them by sitting up. Amused with herself, she then addresses the characters:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "So, who are you then? Not hobgoblins or draconians. Not ghosts or ghoulies either. Oh, I know—you must be trespassers! That's fun."
^44f

Lorry has spent the last several days in rat form, surveilling the citadel's new residents. She'll happily parley with the characters as she's been unimaginably bored.

Lorry chatters at length and eventually provides the following information, only some of which is useful:

- Lorry came to the City of Lost Names about two hundred years ago, searching for treasure. Alstare Bellis caught her and turned her into a vampire. Fifty years later he bricked her up in the chamber, though she has no idea why (it's because she's a chatterbox).  
- Lorry recently escaped her prison when the temple rising broke apart the bricks sealing her crypt.  
- Alstare is a jerk, but he knows a lot about the temple. He's afraid of the black rose knight.  
- A ghost named [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is lurking around—it seems like he's up to no good. Lorry is thinking about destroying him and putting in for his job.  
- Most of the dragon-people spend their time above ground, but some of the higher-ups have been spending time in the sanctuary (area S12).  

##### Treasure

Lorry's backpack is tucked in the corner of the room. Among her possessions are a [potion of gaseous form](Mechanics/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md), a [ring of spell storing](Mechanics/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md) with a [seeming](Mechanics/spells/seeming.md) spell (save DC 16) stored in it, and a ventriloquist's dummy with a sharp widow's peak and a red satin cape. Lorry turns hostile if the characters try to take these items without her permission.

#### S12: Sanctuary

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Crumbled frescoes lie along the walls of this dilapidated sanctuary. A twenty-foot-tall statue of the Dragon Queen dominates the west end of the room, with smaller statues arrayed behind it.
^452

This chamber's vaulted ceiling is 50 feet high. Obsidian columns outline the walls, though a portion of the south wall has partially caved in, collapsing two of the columns. At the center of the room stands a statue of Takhisis in her five-headed form. Statues of the evil gods Chemosh, Hiddukel, Morgion, Nuitari, Sargonnas, and Zeboim (detailed in the introduction) form a semicircle behind Takhisis's statue. A character who is a cleric of a depicted deity or who succeeds on a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the deity's statue.

##### Creatures

The [aurak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md) Drayan supervises six [bozak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) in this room. The bozaks are busy dismantling the statues of the gods behind the effigy of Takhisis. If a fight ensues and the draconians are losing, Drayan uses the [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) spell to flee to area S18, where she prepares to ambush the characters.

##### Statue

If the characters examine the statue of Takhisis, they notice depressions spaced along its base and a plaque reading, "Yield to Her Will." A character who inspects the depressions and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check realizes they serve as handles to rotate the statue.

Though the statue is designed to move, it's still immensely heavy. It can be rotated to a new position by a character who succeeds on a DC 22 Strength check or by creatures with a combined Strength of 40 or higher.

If the statue is rotated to face north, the secret door to area S14 opens. If the statue is rotated to face south, the secret door to area S13 opens. If it is rotated to face any other direction, the statue's heads animate and breathe flame. Each creature in the chamber must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the statue has breathed flame, it rotates back to face east.

##### Secret Doors

There are secret doors in the north and south walls. A character can find one by searching that area and succeeding on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, but there's no clear way of opening either door until the statue is moved.

#### S13: Treasure Vault

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Coins and other valuables lie strewn about this partially collapsed chamber. Among them is a sizable mirror with an intact pane of black glass.
^457

This is the temple's treasure vault, where offerings and the recovered goods of enemies were kept.

##### Treasure

Though some of this room has crumbled, the characters can easily retrieve 5,200 gp worth of coins and valuable pieces of art, as well as a [potion of gaseous form](Mechanics/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md), two [potions of healing (superior)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md), a [+1 greatsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md), and the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A).

#### S14: Primordial Altar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Within a cave of dark stone stands a gleaming altar of black obsidian polished to a mirror shine. Where the light strikes it, bands of color glimmer within the altar: blue, green, white, and red.
^45a

This chamber holds a primordial altar to Takhisis, a weakening in the fabric of the planes where the Dragon Queen's will bleeds into Krynn. The chamber is desecrated ground that grants Undead, Fiends, and worshipers of Takhisis advantage on attack rolls.

##### Altar

The first character who touches the primordial altar is [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the start of their next turn. During that time, their mind fills with terrifying visions of Takhisis's draconic heads shrieking in triumph, the Dragon Armies marching across the face of Ansalon, and a dark temple rising from broken ground. The character gains the charm [Dragon Queen's Will](Mechanics/rewards/dragon-queens-will-dsotdq.md) (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"; see below).

##### Creatures

As soon a creature touches the altar, three [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) emerge and attack.

#### S15: Draconian Garrison

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Simple bunk beds and equipment racks fill this room. A few tables are littered with the remains of past meals.
^45f

This garrison is occupied by four [bozak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and three [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks).

#### S16: Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An old desk sits in this study. One of its legs is missing and has been propped up with chunks of rubble. Doors lead from this room to the west, north, and east.
^461

The top drawer of the desk contains Dragon Army reports on troops and supplies on the surface of the flying island, as well as a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [arcane eye](Mechanics/spells/arcane-eye.md).

#### S17: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ancient shelves have collapsed into heaps along the walls. Old books with deteriorated bindings spill their pages onto the dusty floor.
^463

The books here are rotted and worthless, but a character who spends five minutes searching the library finds a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [polymorph](Mechanics/spells/polymorph.md).

#### S18: Draconian War Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber holds a large table, which is covered by a roughly drawn map of Nightlund along with several other documents and scraps of paper.
^465

Six [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) are here reviewing the battle plan for the assault on Kalaman. On the table in front of them are rough sketches of Kalaman's leadership, including Marshal Vendri, Darrett, and the characters themselves. One of the sivaks has a key to the cells in area S19.

If Drayan was encountered in area S12 and escaped, she is here when the characters arrive. If so, only four sivak draconians are with her. [Drayan](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md) has readied an action to use her Noxious Breath as soon as she sees a character in range.

#### S19: Cells

These bare stone cells once quartered the temple's priests. They are currently empty.

#### S20: Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is piled with bits of rubble, pottery, a pair of broken stone gargoyles, a painting of a sunset over a city skyline, and a bronze bust of a dignified man wearing a hat with an excessive number of feathers.
^468

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s servants use this room to store junk. Most of it has no value, but the bust is of Istarian origin and is worth 1,000 gp to a collector. Characters might recall seeing hats of similar style to the one the man is wearing in the City of Lost Names.

### Bastion of Takhisis

The City of Lost Names was built on a foundation of pillaged dragon bones, which gave it much of its magic. The Bastion of Takhisis (depicted on map 7.3) now carries that magic's legacy, empowered by the Mourning Flame that burns in the Mourning Sanctum at the temple's heart.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.3: Bastion of Takhisis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/122-map-7.03-bastion-of-takhisis.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/123-map-7.03-bastion-of-takhisis-player.webp#gallery)

#### S21: Ruined Hall

When the characters enter this area, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From the top of the stairs, a shattered corridor runs to the south. The ancient walls to the west and east are made of crumbling stone, and flickering violet light shines through gaps in the east wall.
> 
> At the south end of the hall, another stairway rises into one of the ruin's corner towers. An unfamiliar soldier in Kalaman's armor stands there. With a look of mild surprise, she notices you. "Oh. You," she says. "You could be helpful. Come on." With that, she turns and heads up the far stairs.
^46b

This hall connects the stairs leading to areas S19 and S22.

##### Crumbled Wall

The east wall here is weak and riddled with cracks. The Mourning Sanctum (area S23) is visible to creatures that look through these cracks. A 10-foot section of this wall is a Large object with AC 17, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If destroyed, the wall topples, providing access to area S23 and alerting creatures in that area to the characters' presence.

##### Soldier

The soldier is a [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) wearing the armor of a Kalaman soldier—but she's possessed by [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) (detailed in chapter 4; stat block in appendix B). When she notices the characters, she withdraws up the stairs to area S22.

#### S22: Nuitari's Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This dilapidated room was clearly once a shrine, and its walls are covered in carvings of robed figures gathered beneath a large black moon. Recesses with lit black candles and melted wax cover the walls at even intervals. Simple doors lead to the north and east.
^46f

A cleric of Nuitari or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the moon in the wall carvings represents the god Nuitari.

##### Caradoc

The soldier the characters encountered in area S21 withdraws here. This is [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) possessing the body of a veteran in Kalaman armor. [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is eager to speak with the characters and enlist them in a plot to betray [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and steal the flying citadel for himself. He doesn't try to disguise his identity despite the new body he's claimed. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) believes Soth's alliance with the Dragon Army is folly, distracting him from taking revenge against the Knights of Solamnia.  
- [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) wants to take control of the flying citadel. He promises to leave Kalaman if the characters help him do so.  
- Soth is higher up in the ruins (area S25), where he controls the flying citadel using a throne linked to the Cataclysmic fire holding the citadel aloft.  
- Soth is fantastically powerful. [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) urges the characters to find a way to distract him or otherwise undermine him without fighting.  
- [Wersten Kern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wersten-kern-dsotdq.md), Soth's standard bearer, guards the brazier containing the Cataclysmic fire. She's loyal to Soth and will have to be disposed of as well.  

[Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md)'s plans are doomed to failure, as the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) in area S25 can be used only by a spellcaster. (Later, when [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) realizes he can't attune to it, he goes into a rage and attacks the characters.) If the characters don't ally with [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md), he sends them on their way, then attempts to ambush them the next time they're vulnerable—likely in area S25.

Regardless of how [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) interacts with the characters, use his warnings to reinforce the danger of engaging [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) in outright combat.

##### Captive Soldier

If the soldier [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is possessing drops to 0 hit points, allow her to make death saving throws, as the characters may wish to heal her. Her name is [Amelia Ghallen](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/amelia-ghallen-dsotdq.md) (neutral good, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)). She remembers being captured during a battle with the Red Dragon Army and taken alongside other prisoners to a terrifying castle in the mountains. She helps the characters defeat [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) if the spirit is present, but she wants nothing more than to return home to Kalaman.

#### S23: Mourning Sanctum

![Wersten Kern loyally serve...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/124-07-008.werstern-kern.webp#center "Wersten Kern loyally serves Lord Soth and stands guard over the Mourning Sanctum")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The interior of this mighty temple has been hollowed out, its roof and interior walls reduced to rubble, creating one great chamber. At the north of the ruins stands a menacing statue of the Dragon Queen with her five snarling draconic heads. Above the statue, deteriorating stone reveals a shadowy chamber in the wall forty feet up.
> 
> At the chamber's center, a massive brazier—easily ten feet tall and thirty feet across—roils with violet flames. A crude iron scaffold surrounds it, with uneven stairs climbing to a platform surrounding the lip of the brazier. Four supports crowned by blazing violet flames levitate around the scaffold, holding it aloft. A figure in blackened armor stands atop the scaffold, bearing a pike fluttering with tattered cloth.
^473

This is the heart of the flying citadel. The magic of the Cataclysmic fire here holds the citadel aloft—and it is also the forge from which death dragons emerge. The gates at the south of the room lead from the temple to the surface of the flying island, but they're sealed shut.

##### Wersten Kern

The figure atop the scaffold is [Wersten Kern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wersten-kern-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B), an Undead former Knight of Solamnia who is now [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s standard bearer. When she notices a character, she salutes them and demands they either submit and join the service of her master, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), or face her in honorable, one-on-one combat. Regardless of their response, she begins battle by using her Terrifying Litany action. Kern fights to the death and prioritizes attacking foes that seek to damage the room's brazier or scaffold.

##### Lord Soth

If the characters didn't already paralyze [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) with the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) in area S25, he arrives 3 rounds after the battle with Kern begins and immediately attacks. See area S25 for more details.

##### Brazier

Cataclysmic fire fills the room's giant brazier. A creature that falls into it takes 70 (`20d6`) necrotic damage. The brazier's flames can be extinguished by bathing a holy relic of a good-aligned god in the flames, such as a [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md). If the players don't think of this on their own, have the characters make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) or Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. On a successful check, a character recalls [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) said the power of the gods could quell the flames, and they remember the [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) bears Paladine's power. Extinguishing the flames destroys the brazier, as detailed below.

##### Scaffold

The scaffold surrounding the brazier rises 10 feet off the ground. Stairs to the west and east climb to its top. Four floating supports with depressions holding Cataclysmic fire support the scaffold and the brazier. These supports are Large objects with AC 18, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If all four supports are destroyed, the scaffold and brazier topple as detailed below.

##### Destroying the Brazier

If either the Cataclysmic fire in the brazier is extinguished or the supports holding aloft the scaffolding are destroyed, the brazier topples and the magical flame within goes out. Proceed with "The Citadel's Destruction" below.

#### S24: Sargonnas's Shrine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A hulking minotaur is carved in bas-relief on this shrine's west wall. Scorch marks cover the floors and walls. Doors lead to the north and west.
^47a

Two [skeletal knights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-knight-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) stand guard in this room.

A cleric of Sargonnas or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the images on the walls represent the god Sargonnas.

![Lord Soth glimpses his pas...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/125-07-009.lord-soth-glimpse.webp#center "Lord Soth glimpses his past betrayals in the Mirror of Reflected Pasts")

#### S25: Lord Soth's Throne Room

Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters enter this room:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sections of this chamber's walls have fallen, revealing both the open interior of the temple and the dark clouds surrounding the flying island beyond. Overlooking the violet flame at the temple's heart below, this chamber holds a crude throne made of broken marble. Veins of pulsing violet light—the same shade as the flames below—pulse through the stone. A still figure in charred armor sits on the throne, glowing red eyes staring from his closed, crown-like helm. His charred breastplate bears a black rose emblem.
^47c

The throne is the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A) that controls the movement of the flying island. It draws its power from the brazier in area S23. If the brazier there is destroyed, the helm ceases to function.

The floor of area S23 is 40 feet below the ledge bearing the throne. The entirety of that area is visible from here.

##### Lord Soth

Unless the characters already encountered him in area S23, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) is seated on the throne. Soth is fixated on controlling the movement of the flying citadel and ignores the characters until they address him. Soth is a terrifying figure, and his armored corpse crackles with cinders. Once confronted, he speaks little, preferring concise threats like "Submit" or "Die." If possible, he begins combat using his Cataclysmic Fire action against a group of characters.

##### Distracting Lord Soth

If confronted with the [mirror of reflected pasts](Mechanics/items/mirror-of-reflected-pasts-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A), [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) fails all saving throws to resist its effects. He whispers the name "Isolde" before staring into the mirror, transfixed. So long as [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) can see the mirror, he is [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 hour or until he takes damage. If damaged while [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) by the mirror, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) can make saving throws against the mirror's effects as normal.

### The Citadel's Destruction

If the characters destroy the brazier in area S23, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> With a cacophony of whispered sighs, the violet flames vanish. You feel the flying island beneath you lurch to a stop. Everything is silent for a moment, then with the sound of a distant crack, the ground begins to shudder. A split runs through the floor and up a nearby wall. The citadel is breaking apart!
^480

With the brazier's destruction, the magic holding the flying citadel aloft ends. This disengages the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) in area S25 and destroys all the lesser death dragons allied with the Red Dragon Army, reducing them to inanimate bones.

Any other threats the characters are contending with remain, but the characters have succeeded in their primary mission. Now they must escape the shattering citadel. There's no set time limit for how long the characters have until the flying citadel crashes, but don't let the players know this. Use the following scenes to encourage characters to flee the citadel as swiftly as possible.

#### Soth's End

The characters witness [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) consumed by disaster. If he is in area S23 or S25, the ground opens beneath the death knight and he falls into darkness. He doesn't appear again in this adventure, and it will take exceptional coercion for Soth to ally with the Dragon Armies in the future.

#### Escape Routes

Allow the characters to decide how they're going to escape the citadel. If they race through the temple's underground levels, they encounter falling rocks as the structure shakes apart (see "Scenes of Destruction"). Alternatively, widening cracks in the temple walls allow the characters to quickly leave the bastion and flee to the flying island's edge (see below). The area outside is depicted on map 7.4 and features the following areas outside the Bastion of Takhisis:

- **Cataclysmic Smoke.** Violet vapor drifts from the temple, leaving the area it fills heavily obscured.  
- **Dragon Army Camps.** Dozens of Dragon Army troops panic amid rows of tents and dragonnel landing strips.  
- **Plaza.** This raised, 10-foot-high plaza provides a vantage of the surrounding chaos. Stairs descend to the south.  
- **Ruins.** Ruined Istarian buildings lie scattered across the area.

The hundreds of Dragon Army troops outside the citadel are largely too preoccupied with their own escape to pay the characters any attention.

Whatever their path, before the characters manage to escape, highlight the flying citadel's deconstruction with events from the "Scenes of Destruction" section, then proceed with the "Karavarix's Revenge" section.

#### Scenes of Destruction

Emphasize the destruction of the flying citadel and the effects of the extinguished Cataclysmic flames using any of the following events you wish:

- **Death Dragon Destruction.** A [lesser death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) lands near the characters. The violet flames animating it fade, and the creature collapses into a pile of inanimate bones. Elsewhere, the characters can see other death dragons falling, their flames extinguished as well.  
- **Falling Rocks.** Part of the temple collapses. Each character must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 27 (`6d8`) bludgeoning damage.  
- **Hungry Crevice.** Six [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) rush toward the characters through a crack opening in the temple walls. A 10-foot-wide fissure in the ground opens up, swallowing the draconians in darkness.  

#### Karavarix's Revenge

Before the characters escape, they're confronted by [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md), the first and most powerful of the death dragons. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An animate dragon skeleton larger than any other you've seen bursts through the crumbling ground, its body still blazing with violet flames.
^485

[Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md) is a chaotic evil [greater death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/greater-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) who hasn't been affected by the destruction of the brazier in the Mourning Sanctum (area S23). In life, she was the gold dragon [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) slew during his quest to the flying city of Onyari—and [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md) still seeks revenge. Before she attacks, she roars, "[Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)! I won't be driven from the skies again. I'll have my revenge on you and all humans!" Characters who explored the catacombs beneath Castle Kalaman (detailed in chapter 4) recall the name [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md), the dragon he slew, and the statue in his tomb with gold dragon features. [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md) then fights until destroyed.

![Karavarix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/128-07-010.karavarix.webp#center)

#### Escaping the Bastion

The citadel is 300 feet in the air. Before it crashes, the characters can escape it using the following options or any other approach they please:

- **Magic.** The easiest way off the Bastion of Takhisis is magic, such as the [feather fall](Mechanics/spells/feather-fall.md) or [fly](Mechanics/spells/fly.md) spell.  
- **Narycrash.** If the characters obtained extra [narycrashes](Mechanics/items/narycrash-dsotdq.md) earlier in the adventure, these devices can be used to escape.  
- **Enemy Dragonnels.** Although most Dragon Army dragonnels have abandoned the citadel, a few remain trapped in stables across the plaza. If the characters free them, the dragonnels help them escape to the battlefield below.  
- **Clystran's Dragonnels.** If the characters can find no other way off the flying citadel, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) and his dragonnel friends arrive just in time to airlift the characters to the battlefield below.  

## Dragon Army Rout

The destruction of the citadel is a great blow to the Red Dragon Army's morale. Its forces are shaken, but Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) seeks to wrest revenge from the jaws of defeat.

### The Sky Is Falling

When the characters safely reach the ground, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Above the field west of Kalaman, the Bastion of Takhisis crumbles. As the flying citadel tilts precariously, massive boulders fall to the earth, taking Dragon Army troops with them. Below, the Dragon Army scatters to avoid the rain of devastation, but the flying citadel's ruins crush its forces in droves.
^489

The characters land a quarter mile from Kalaman's west wall. There is little risk of the flying citadel crashing on the characters, but fallen rocks and the bones of death dragons litter the field. Draconians with half their hit points flee the flying citadel, making hard landings on the battlefield. These and other foes scatter, fleeing the battlefield in every direction and ignoring the characters.

### Clash of Fallen Flames

![Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/129-07-011.dragon-highmaster-kansaldi.webp#center "Dragon Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes scours the battlefield astride the red dragon Ignia")

When the characters start their return to Kalaman, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A streak of red sweeps low over the battlefield, crashing through dozens of retreating enemies. At the last moment, it sweeps upward and a mighty red dragon perches atop a stone spire fallen from the citadel above. On the dragon's back sits a woman with short white hair and Dragon Army armor. She levels a vicious pike at you as her left eye—a crimson gemstone—smolders with magical flame.
^48b

This is [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and her red dragon ally, [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md). [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md) uses the [young red dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md) stat block but is Huge. Kansaldi spotted the characters fleeing the flying citadel and now seeks revenge. She's a fanatical follower of the Dragon Queen and vents righteous rage on the characters, including the following topics:

- The Dragon Queen's victory is inevitable. Half of Ansalon already bows to Takhisis.  
- The characters might've delayed Kalaman's fall, but Kansaldi's troops are a mere fraction of the Dragon Armies' forces. Her master, Dragon Highlord Verminaard, will return with greater numbers.  
- Agents from the Blue Dragon Army are gathering other floating pieces of the City of Lost Names. One way or another, the Dragon Armies will conquer the skies.  
- Kansaldi will show the characters mercy for their audacity—if one character submits to her, she will spare the others. The one who submits must agree to be burned to death by [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md) for all to see.  
- If any among the characters wish to join the Red Dragon Army, they're free to prove their allegiance to her.  

Kansaldi and [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md) attack if her demands are ignored or rebuffed. This battlefield is represented on map 7.5. See the following sections for details on this battlefield's features.

Kansaldi and [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md) start atop the spire, 30 feet above the characters. The characters begin amid the citadel rubble at the south of the map. Both foes use ranged attacks to keep the characters at bay. They engage in melee combat only if a creature reaches them atop the spire or if they're outmatched in ranged combat. Both fight to the death.

Even as she dies, Kansaldi whispers to the characters that her death is the sacrifice Takhisis wants and that victory is now assured.

#### Treasure

Kansaldi's gold-embossed half helmet is worth 3,000 gp, and a crimson [gem of seeing](Mechanics/items/gem-of-seeing.md) is embedded in her left eye socket. The gem can be removed only if Kansaldi is dead. When used, the gem grows uncomfortably warm to the touch.

If Kansaldi is dead, this [gem of seeing](Mechanics/items/gem-of-seeing.md) becomes a sentient magic item of lawful evil alignment with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and normal vision in a range of 120 feet. The gem can speak and understand Common and Draconic, and it can communicate telepathically with its wielder. It promises its bearer the Dragon Queen's favor if they replace one of their eyes with the gem.

#### Clash of Fallen Flames Features

The battlefield includes the following features:

- **Citadel Spire.** A 30-foot-tall stone shard dominates the center of the battlefield. A cliff winds up its side, making it possible to walk from the ground to the top. There are ample handholds in the rock, making it easy to climb.  
- **Citadel Rubble and Dragon Skeletons.** The squares with fallen rubble or bones of dead dragons are "difficult terrain".  
- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents dozens of Dragon Army troops trying to retreat. This area and the battlefield beyond the map are "difficult terrain". A creature that starts its turn in the Fray or that enters the Fray for the first time during a turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage from attacks by opportunistic foes.

#### Clash of Fallen Flames Events

During this encounter, on initiative count 0 each round, roll on the Clash of Fallen Flames Events table. The encounter ends when both Kansaldi and [Ignia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ignia-dsotdq.md) are defeated.

**Clash of Fallen Flames Events**

### Aftermath of the Siege

When Kansaldi is defeated, the Red Dragon Army breaks completely, retreating southeast toward the Taman Busuk.

The adventure unfolds in one of two ways from here:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you are using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game along with this adventure, consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 12" sidebar.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the following section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 12
> 
> As the characters near the gates of Kalaman, a contingent of the city's defenders emerges to clear the remaining Dragon Army forces from the field. Run scenario 12 from *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn* to represent this final conflict.
> 
> If the characters attain a win or hold during this scenario, Darrett approaches the characters and gives them something he found amid the rubble of the flying citadel. If there is a good cleric or paladin among the characters, this item is a [talisman of pure good](Mechanics/items/talisman-of-pure-good.md) in the shape of their god's holy symbol. If there's not, it's an ancient [+3 shield](Mechanics/items/3-shield.md) bearing Solamnic knotwork designs and the symbol of Paladine. Characters gain no reward for a loss.
> 
> At the end of the scenario, proceed with "Kalaman Victorious."
^warriors-of-krynn-scenario-12

## Kalaman Victorious

With the defeat of the Red Dragon Army, the characters return to a heroes' welcome in Kalaman. Their allies, including Darrett and Marshal Vendri, are among the first to express their awe and thanks on behalf of the entire city. Truly, Kalaman wouldn't have survived were it not for the characters' daring. The city spends the rest of the day repairing the city's fortifications and honoring those who died in the city's defense, but the night is filled with celebration and song.

### An Uncertain Future

Celebrations and enthusiasm fill Kalaman for days after the Dragon Army's defeat, and its people begin to make hopeful plans for the future. Here are the plans of just a few of the characters' allies:

- **Clystran.** [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) has seen more than enough of the city and is eager to return to Heart's Hollow with his dragonnels. He invites the characters to visit the next time they're in the Northern Wastes.  
- **Darrett.** With the danger of the Dragon Armies past for the moment, Darrett plans to travel to the city of Maelgoth, where he hopes to become a true member of the Knights of Solamnia.  
- **Marshal Vendri.** Ever pragmatic, Marshal Vendri is wary the Dragon Army might soon return, and she seeks ways to reinforce the city's defenses. She also plans to send agents to Maelgoth and Palanthas to court the Knights of Solamnia and the country's other great cities to aid in Kalaman's defense.  
- **Raven and Vogler's Villagers.** With Kalaman's support, Raven is leading an initial foray to Vogler. She hopes to see what can be salvaged and to plan the village's restoration. Raven is committed to hosting a fantastic Kingfisher Festival in the village next year.  
- **Rookledust and Than.** The gnomes learned they work well together, and with such radically different fields of interest, they're fascinated by the prospect of collaborating in the future. They plan to return to Rookledust's workshop and begin work on new inventions.  

Use these plans to wrap up the stories of these characters or to foreshadow future adventures.

### Heroes' Celebration

A week after the siege of Kalaman, the city hosts a great ceremony in the courtyard of Castle Kalaman to celebrate the characters and all who perished in defense of the city.

Heroes alive and dead are honored with medals and speeches. Governor Thren and Marshal Vendri personally thank the characters. Before all assembled, Vendri pronounces the characters' commitment to the Kalaman military honorably discharged; they've completed the terms of their involvement with Kalaman's defenders (as set forward in chapter 4). Characters who accept this honorable discharge are rewarded with platinum medallions bearing the symbol of Kalaman worth 2,500 gp. Characters who choose to remain a part of Kalaman's army receive the same medallion and are granted a new title: Knight of Kalaman. The responsibilities of this position and future assignments are for you to determine.

Additionally, if the characters participated in battles using the *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn* game, dole out the campaign rewards from that game as part of this celebration.

### Mysterious Message

After the characters have received their rewards, a Kalaman soldier delivers a message for them, which was left with a guard at Castle Kalaman's gate. The letter is sealed with blue wax bearing the Dragon Queen's symbol and reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Congratulations, heroes of Kalaman. I toast your bravery and daring. I could use audacious souls, such as yourselves, and will be watching your exploits with interest. Your city has escaped the Dragon Queen's grasp today, but none can defy her will for long. I hope that when first we meet, it won't be among Kalaman's ruins.
^496

The message bears no signature, but the seal is the symbol of the Dragon Queen impressed upon blue wax, suggesting an agent of the Blue Dragon Army.

The adventure ends here. Use this message to foreshadow future conflicts in the War of the Lance or to continue your adventures in Krynn.
