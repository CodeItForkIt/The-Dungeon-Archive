# Chapter 3: When Home Burns
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 51* 

At the edge of the Solamnic province of Hinterlund lies the quiet fishing village of Vogler. Home to humans, kender, and hill dwarves, Vogler is the last stop on the road to nowhere. To the village's north, scattered woods and shady brooks give way to the deadly badlands known as the Northern Wastes. Across the Vingaard River to the south stretches a land of grim legends and opportunity: the province of Nightlund, whose nearby port of Kalaman welcomes traders from long-forgotten lands. Vogler's people know little of the evil afoot in the world. On the day the characters arrive, the people of Vogler are concerned with two things: kicking off the annual Kingfisher Festival and putting a local hero to rest.

Before running this chapter, make sure each character has a reason for attending the funeral of Ispin Greenshield and experienced a fateful event during their journey to Vogler, as detailed in chapter 2.

## Running This Chapter

The events of this chapter unfold in two parts. First, the characters are introduced to the quaint village of Vogler during its annual Kingfisher Festival, where they meet many of the town's inhabitants. Familiarize yourself with the "Vogler Gazetteer" section in this chapter, which introduces many of the people and places in the town.

In the second part of the chapter, war comes to Vogler. The characters must survive a mercenary company's betrayal and ultimately help the townsfolk flee an invasion by the Red Dragon Army.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- The characters start this chapter at 2nd level, having gained a level after the events in chapter 2.  
- They advance to 3rd level after the Battle of High Hill.  
- They advance to 4th level at the end of the chapter, after evacuating Vogler.  

## Arriving in Vogler

The characters arrive on the day of Ispin Greenshield's funeral, which is scheduled to take place in the evening. Read or paraphrase the following text when you're ready for the adventure to begin:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The fishing village of Vogler clings to a spit of land reaching into the Vingaard River. Wooded cliffs overlook the community, and the only path from the north descends past the ivy-covered remnants of a crumbling stone keep. The village's modest wooden buildings cluster around a quaint central circle and along the riverbank.
> 
> Jutting into the river—out of place and seemingly out of time—stands an incomplete stone bridge of incredible artisanship. The structure clearly dates to before the Cataclysm, eclipsing its modern peers in size and sturdiness. The bridge crosses less than half the river's width before giving way to a series of ropes and tethered rafts serving as ferries.
> 
> On the river itself, dozens of small boats drift along the slow, murky waters as the fishers of Vogler ply their trade.
^0d8

The characters can explore Vogler as they please. Individuals or small groups could peruse the market, observe villagers preparing for the Kingfisher Festival, or find the rooms that—per their invitations—await them at the Brass Crab.

Use the "Vogler Gazetteer" section to help characters get acquainted with the village. Once they're done exploring it, they should meet at the Brass Crab for the funeral. From there, proceed with the "Final Farewell" section.

## Vogler Gazetteer

The Solamnic village of Vogler rests at the foot of a partially built bridge on the Vingaard River. Fishers, lumberers, hunters, and farmers live here peacefully, only occasionally interrupted by bandits or predators from the Northern Wastes. In addition to a volunteer militia maintained by Mayor [Raven Uth Vogler](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/raven-uth-vogler-dsotdq.md), the village is ostensibly under the protection of Hinterlund's capital, Maelgoth. This protection takes the form of a retired Knight of Solamnia, [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md), who's stationed at the crumbling Thornwall Keep—now more a historic landmark than a true fortification.

### The Kingfisher Festival

The characters' visit to Vogler overlaps with the kickoff of the Kingfisher Festival, an annual celebration commemorating Solamnia's victory over the forces of Istar during a clash near the town centuries ago. The festival takes its name from the kingfisher, a symbol of the Knights of Solamnia and a bird the fishers of Vogler consider lucky. Festivities culminate with the locals' reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, a clash between Istarian and Solamnic soldiers.

### Locations in Vogler

While in Vogler, the characters might visit any of the locations in this section. These sites are marked on map 3.1.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/038-map-3.01-vogler-player.webp#gallery)

#### The Brass Crab

The Brass Crab is a modest single-story inn on the village wharf, and its exterior vaguely resembles its namesake. Its proprietor, an Ergothian woman named Yalme (neutral good, human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), has an odd love of bad storytellers and inept musicians. One wall of the circular common room features a faded mural of two enormous crabs locked in combat, inlaid with brass details. The mural's origins are lost to time, but if asked, Yalme says she named the crabs Fancy and Gorgeous George. Four short halls branch off the common room, each lined with rooms for rent.

#### The Fishbowl

After a long day on the river, many of Vogler's fishers gather at the Fishbowl to tell tales, quench their thirst, and indulge in baked fish pies. The cramped but well-kept tavern is known for its savory baked goods more than its weak ale. The Fishbowl's proprietor is the elderly Elthar (neutral good, human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), whom most locals call Uncle.

#### High Hill

High Hill stands a mile north of Vogler. Centuries ago, Solamnic and Istarian forces clashed here, and legends claim the spirits of fallen knights haunt the hill and watch over the town. Each year, the Kingfisher Festival's reenactment of the battle serves as a reminder of the village's history and nominally honors any spirits lingering at the battlefield.

#### Market

Across from Vogler's busy wharf spreads the village market. Amid this collection of stalls, vendors sell fresh river fish, fishing supplies, crafts, the bounty of local farms, and all manner of mundane equipment. One notable stall is that of Froswin (chaotic good, kender [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), who sells intricate fish-bone puppets she designs in the shapes of animals and sea serpents.

#### Mayor's Home

Vogler's down-to-earth mayor, [Raven Uth Vogler](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/raven-uth-vogler-dsotdq.md) (neutral good, human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)), lives in a two-story house on the village circle. Raven is a practical, empathetic leader in her thirties who grew up on the river. She keeps a pair of guest rooms—lavishly decorated with mounted fish—where she frequently hosts villagers going through tough times.

#### Mercenary Camp

Along the road north of Vogler, a mile past High Hill, lies a mercenary camp. Known as the Ironclad Regiment, the soldiers here are under the command of Captain Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile (introduced in the "Final Farewell" section). Cudgel is a friend of the deceased Ispin Greenshield and many others in town, and she brought her company to Vogler a week ago to attend Ispin's funeral. She volunteered her band to take part in the annual reenactment of the Battle of High Hill—her attempt to lift the village's spirits after their loss.

During the day, Cudgel remains in the camp with her lieutenants—the half-ogre Gragonis and the human [Jeyev Veldrews](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jeyev-veldrews-dsotdq.md)—along with several dozen mercenaries. The soldiers spend most of the day participating in drills. At night, they keep to themselves, lounging and playing dice. They're under strict orders from Cudgel not to interfere with the locals.

#### River Gate

Those who enter Vogler from the north pass through the unguarded River Gate, a 15-foot-tall wooden archway carved with two leaping fish on its frame. Over the years, locals have etched the coin-sized scales of these fish with prayers for bountiful fishing. Two large wooden doors stand within the arch, but they haven't been closed for years and are embedded in the surrounding dirt.

#### Thornwall Keep

The ruins of an ancient Solamnic keep perch on a rocky rise at the western edge of town. Thornwall Keep's steward, the knight [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md) (introduced in the "Final Farewell" section), maintains the keep. Partially ruined walls surround the keep's three-story tower. The tower's ground level holds a small library and a collection of local relics: over forty pieces of rusty tools and armor. The second floor holds the quarters of Becklin's squire, [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) (introduced in the "Parting Gift" section later in this chapter). Becklin's austere room lies on the uppermost story; from there, a ladder leads to the keep's crenelated roof.

Vogler's resident tinker gnome, Than, built an elaborate catapult-like contraption on the roof of the keep. A friend of Becklin and Darrett, Than occasionally drops by to fine-tune this device, called a gnomeflinger (detailed in appendix A). Though it looks like a weapon of war, the contraption is a mode of rapid transportation originally devised by the tinker gnomes of Mount Nevermind. Becklin tolerates the gnomeflinger—and the noise of Than's occasional early-morning tinkering—because she sees the catapult-shaped device as a deterrent against attack.

> [!note] Deliberate Welcome
> 
> The village of Vogler welcomes good-natured visitors of all walks. As the characters explore the village, play up its quaint charms and hospitable locals.
> 
> Vogler should begin to feel like a home away from home for the characters, and the villagers might even become like family to them. Later in the chapter, when Vogler suffers disaster, the characters should feel the loss of Vogler's destruction, wanting to save the villagers and help their friends rebuild new lives.
^deliberate-welcome

#### Village Circle

The homes and shops in Vogler cluster around a grassy patch shaded by an ancient tree. This green is encircled by a dirt road that branches off into streets leading north out of the village and south to the ferry across the Vingaard, and others radiating out into the town. The village circle serves as a public space, meeting spot, and festival ground. An iron bell hangs atop a tall pole near the mayor's house. In times of need, anyone who vigorously rings the bell summons the mayor and `2d12` volunteer militia members ([guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) who arrive in about 5 minutes. The local militia is largely composed of retired farmers and fishers who exhibit more zeal than skill in the village's defense, but they all take the bell's sounding very seriously.

#### Vogler's Crossing

South of Vogler, an incomplete stone bridge begins to stretch across the Vingaard River. Half-constructed before the Cataclysm using techniques lost in the ages since, the bridge looks like a glorified pier—a remnant of once-promised glory. A simple ferry system of ropes and winches follows the bridge's supports and connects with posts on the opposite shore. Simple rafts and skiffs allow travelers and even small wagons to cross the river. The process is safe but slow, taking approximately 10 minutes for a raft to cross the broad river. Travelers can make use of the crossing themselves or hire a ferrier to aid them for 1 sp.

#### Westide House

The horseshoe-shaped structure known as Westide House is only slightly larger than the other homes in Vogler, but its owner speaks of it as if it were an opulent country manor. This is the home of Lord [Bakaris Uth Estide](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-uth-estide-dsotdq.md) (neutral evil, human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md); detailed in chapter 4) and his son, [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) (introduced in the "Heckler" section later in this chapter). Lord Bakaris is a Solamnic noble who claims to be living in exile after raiders burned his family home in Estwilde. In truth, Lord Bakaris and his son were driven from the region and sought anonymity in Vogler. They've been in the village for over a year, throwing their wealth around and treating the people of Vogler as backward yokels.

#### Wharf

Local fishers crowd these docks each dawn and dusk, rowing out with empty nets and returning with the day's catch. At the end of the southernmost pier, a centuries-old wooden post bears an eroded carving of a bird with a fish in its mouth. Many locals rub it for luck before seeking the morning catch. A cleric of Habbakuk or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the carving as a phoenix—a symbol of the god Habbakuk, deity of animal life and the sea.

#### Wharfinger's Office

Wharfinger Umpton Lanth (lawful neutral, human [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) wakes up earlier than any other fisher in Vogler to inspect boats docked at the wharf and impose fines on those in poor repair. Fishers and traders seeking to use the wharf must register with Umpton at his stuffy two-story office across from the market. The office is usually staffed by Umpton's son Nesau (chaotic neutral, human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), who—to his father's consternation—is quick to forgive fines and forgo docking fees when his father isn't present, making him quite popular in the village.

## Final Farewell

Once the characters have reconnected with one another and explored Vogler to their liking, it's time to assemble at the Brass Crab for the funeral of Ispin Greenshield. [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md), who sent the characters their funeral invitations, catches up to the characters prior to the funeral.

### Meeting Becklin

Becklin is hard to miss, as she's dressed in the full-plate armor and horned helmet of the Knights of Solamnia. Though she's never met the characters before, she recognizes one or more of them from Ispin's descriptions. Becklin introduces herself, offers her condolences, and invites the characters to come with her to the Brass Crab if they aren't already there. She explains that the service is meant to be a celebration of Ispin's life, and people will be encouraged to share over-the-top stories about him—like the inflated tales he was known for sharing.

![Becklin Uth Viharin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/039-03-002.berklin-uth-viharin.webp#center)

#### Becklin Uth Viharin

[Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md) (lawful good, human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)) is a Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Crown who, in her earlier years, adventured with Ispin Greenshield and [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md). For the last decade, she has served as castellan of Thornwall Keep in Vogler. This posting is not only an official charge from her superiors but also a quiet retirement for her. Becklin takes her role seriously, maintaining her skills and equipment as she remains alert for danger. In her considerable free time, she indulges her passion for studying the past by excavating the ruins of Thornwall Keep.

The region's commonfolk generally don't hold the Knights of Solamnia in high regard, most believing the knights had a hand in causing—or, at least, not preventing—the Cataclysm. However, the people of Vogler accept Becklin, as her skill at arms has kept the village safe from bandits and dangerous beasts for years.

##### Personality Trait

"Did you know Vogler was an island before the Cataclysm? Let me tell you about it!"

##### Ideal

"We can learn much from the past if we look for it."

##### Bond

"My honor was my life. It's still important to me, but no code accounts for all the challenges of living."

##### Flaw

"I romanticize the past. That's when people had the chance to become legends."

### Sending Off a Friend

![Cudgel Ironsmile and Beckl...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/040-03-003.cudgel-and-becklin.webp#center "Cudgel Ironsmile and Becklin Uth Viharin send off their friend Ispin Greenshield")

The funeral takes place at dusk on the stage and dock extending from the rear of the Brass Crab. Becklin encourages the characters to linger near the dock, while many mourning locals in small fishing craft assemble in the nearby water. When you're ready for the funeral to begin, Becklin takes the stage next to a simple boat, within which rests the body of Ispin Greenshield. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Those who were closest to Ispin Greenshield gather on the dock overlooking the Vingaard River. There, Ispin's body rests in a small boat, his body wrapped in a shroud. A musician plays a soft song as the knight [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md) steps forward in her ornate Solamnic armor. She smiles gently at those assembled, and her voice carries clearly across the water.
> 
> "You all knew Ispin as a friend, and there were none like him. Before he died, he told me this: 'There should be tales, not tears, for an old scoundrel like me. Make sure everyone knows my stories when I head off on the greatest adventure of them all.'"
> 
> Becklin nods, and villagers carry the boat containing Ispin's body to the dock's edge, where she and Cudgel lowered it into the water. "So, let us do just that," Becklin continues as the tiny vessel drifts out onto the Vingaard River. "On the eve of the Kingfisher Festival, we celebrate you, Ispin. Good travels, friend. Until we meet again."
^0f2

With that, the boat bearing Ispin's body drifts down the river and eventually out of sight. After a moment of silence, Becklin invites all assembled into the Brass Crab for a reception and opportunity to share stories about the departed.

### Tales Remembered

The funeral reception is a simple but crowded affair. Yalme, the Brass Crab's proprietor, keeps bread, cheese, and local ale coming for the dozens of attendees. Practically everyone in the village makes an appearance at the reception, and the characters can find anyone they've already met in the village with whom they might want to talk.

Soon after the reception begins, Becklin calls for everyone's attention and shares one of Ispin's favorite stories: the tale of the time the High Sub-Senior Artillerist of Mount Nevermind launched her pet weasel all the way from the gnome enclave to Sancrist Island, then hired Ispin to recover the critter—or, at least, to note its trajectory. Becklin tells several other charming stories about Ispin, then invites attendees to share other tales Ispin might have told them.

Characters are invited to participate in this comic tale telling. They're welcome to improvise their own tales about Ispin, taking cues from what they know about their relationship with the adventurer (as determined in chapter 2). The crowd nods along to nearly any tale a character tells, whether hearing it for the first or the thousandth time. If you or a player wants a story prompt, roll on or choose an option from the Ispin's Stories table. Award "inspiration" to characters who tell a particularly creative or touching story.

### Heckler

During the storytelling, after one or two characters or others have told tales, a finely dressed local named [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) lets out an exaggerated yawn. If left to continue, he eventually blurts out, "We've heard this a thousand times!" or "You're telling it worse than he did!" Bakaris cares nothing for Ispin's death or the locals' mourning—he's only here for the free ale, which he claims is the worst he's ever tasted. The other mourners grumble, but nobody directly confronts the heckler.

![Bakaris the Younger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/041-03-004.bakaris-the-younger.webp#center)

#### Establishing Bakaris

Use this interaction to establish [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) as a cowardly cad. He and his father are local annoyances, and they'll further antagonize the characters later in the adventure. This encounter with Bakaris shouldn't come to violence, but it should give the characters an accurately negative impression of him.

#### Confronting the Heckler

A character who confronts [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) can convince him to stay quiet by roleplaying or succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. After any confrontation, [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) scoffs and complains no one in Vogler can take a joke, then leaves of his own volition.

#### Bakaris "the Younger" Uth Estide

Bakaris (neutral evil, human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) shares the same name as his father, his father's father, and so on for generations. Bakaris places inordinate value on his good looks, fashionable clothes, and athleticism, but he's known more for his arrogance, pettiness, and short temper. He cares nothing for his family name, but he defers to his father—partly from unbroken childhood habit, and partly because all his privilege depends on his father's wealth. Bakaris also has a violent streak. While living in Estwilde, he murdered the son of a local leader during a duel, and he and his father to Vogler to escape the consequences. Bakaris takes quiet pride in that killing, and he fantasizes about one day winning respect via the point of his sword. He loathes being called "the Younger," a diminutive his father encourages.

##### Personality Trait

"My blood, my looks, my skill; everything about me is better than you."

##### Ideal

"I'll force the world to recognize how great I am."

##### Bond

"I've wasted too much time already; I owe it to myself to claim what I deserve."

##### Flaw

"What I can't get with my looks, I'll take with my sword."

### Meeting Cudgel

During the funeral reception, Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile jovially introduces herself to the characters as an old friend of Ispin Greenshield and the leader of the Ironclad Regiment—mercenaries currently camped outside Vogler. Cudgel asks the characters how they knew Ispin and where they traveled from. She talks openly about herself and her plans to participate in tomorrow's reenactment of the Battle of High Hill. Cudgel has no agenda other than to chitchat with out-of-town guests, as they likely have more in common with her than the local fishers. Early in the evening, Cudgel excuses herself to check on her company at the mercenary camp (detailed in the "Vogler Gazetteer" section).

#### Ridomir "Cudgel" Ironsmile

[Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) (neutral, hill dwarf [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) hails from the dwarven nation of Kayolin, south of Solamnia. For most of her life, she adventured with Becklin and Ispin, earning the nickname Cudgel along the way. She now commands her own company of mercenaries known as the Ironclad Regiment. Though small, the company has built a reputation for beating the odds, thanks in large part to her adroit leadership. Beyond a life of fighting, the middle-aged dwarf is a gifted card player. She also has a soft spot for Vogler, which she swears serves the best fish pies in Solamnia.

##### Personality Trait

"The person with the loudest voice usually wins the argument."

##### Ideal

"I like a well-thought-out plan, but a well-executed one is sublime."

##### Bond

"Money motivates, but the right cause inspires."

##### Flaw

"I can be slow to leave the comforts of an inn or tavern."

### Mysterious Mourner

A particularly somber guest—a blue-skinned Silvanesti elf named [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md)—keeps to the fringes of the reception. No one in town knows anything about her except her name, that she arrived a day before the characters, and that she claims to be a performer who knew Ispin. Characters who approach [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) find her politely aloof and evasive about how she knew Ispin—yet she expresses sympathy for the characters, claiming she's lost many loved ones in her long life. A character can convince [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) to perform by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, in which case she sings a heartbreakingly beautiful Silvanesti song in Elvish. Soon after, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) leaves the reception, retiring to her room in the inn.

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) has a role to play later in the adventure (see chapters 4 and 7). Use this scene to introduce this mysterious character, but don't reveal anything of her agenda (detailed below).

#### Leedara

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) died during the Cataclysm over three hundred years ago. Once an elven priest, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) witnessed her companion and fellow priest, Isolde, drawn into the grim fate of the wicked Knight of Solamnia, Lord Loren Soth (detailed in chapter 4). When Soth failed his gods-given quest to prevent the Cataclysm, he became cursed to exist forever as a death knight. As part of his curse, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) and several of her companions returned as deathless spirits devoted to ensuring Soth never finds peace.

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) has spent centuries tormenting [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) in his accursed castle, Dargaard Keep, endlessly reminding him of his failures and losses. Now that the Dragon Queen has summoned Soth, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) works to stymie the death knight however she can. She followed Soth's trail to this area and is in Vogler looking for ways to subtly oppose him.

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) is neutral-aligned and typically appears as a living Silvanesti elf. She has the statistics of a [ghost](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) with the following action:

> [!note] 
> 
> **Change Shape.** [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) magically assumes the appearance she had in life, and her creature type changes to Humanoid, while retaining her other game statistics. This transformation ends if [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) is reduced to 0 hit points or uses an action to end it.
^105

### After the Funeral

After each character who wants to has shared a story or mingled with the locals, the reception winds down. Before the characters retire for the evening, Becklin approaches, thanks them for coming, and says she has something Ispin left for them. She won't say what it is but asks the characters to call on her at Thornwall Keep in the morning.

## Parting Gift

The morning after Ispin's funeral, the characters can take Becklin up on her invitation to Thornwall Keep. They have plenty of time to visit in the morning, as the Kingfisher Festival celebrations don't kick off until midday.

### Meeting Darrett

As the characters head across town toward Thornwall Keep, they meet Becklin's squire, [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md), along the way. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The town is abuzz with festive energy this morning as locals set up stalls and hang decorations. Ahead, the road to Thornwall Keep climbs a low hill toward an ancient edifice, ghostly in the morning mist.
> 
> "Good morning, Becklin's friends," comes a cheerful voice. "I'm glad I caught you." From a shop doorway steps a young man, no more than twenty years old. He has a sword at his hip and a cloth sack in his arm. "I'm Darrett, Becklin's student. I hope you haven't had breakfast already."
^10a

[Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) is Becklin's pupil, though Becklin would refers to him privately as her squire. As much as Darrett respects Becklin and hopes to one day become a true Knight of Solamnia, he knows the people of Vogler frown on the knighthood and would see his aspirations as naive fantasies.

Becklin sent Darrett to fetch baked hand pies from the Fishbowl for the two of them and their guests. He encourages the characters to come with him on his errand. Darrett gets few opportunities to speak with travelers and is eager to do so, but he doesn't press if the characters want to go straight to Thornwall Keep.

If the characters join him on the short walk, Darrett tells them he grew up in Vogler. He peppers the characters with questions about themselves, their travels, their weapons, and anything else about the world beyond Vogler. He knows all about the Kingfisher Festival and shares the following details:

![Darrett Highwater](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/042-03-005.darrett-highwater.webp#center)

- The annual festival celebrates the victory of a Knight of Solamnia, Lord Decater Vogler, over the forces of the Empire of Istar. This battle occurred hundreds of years ago, long before the Cataclysm, and sparked the village's founding.  
- Today's festivities include music, food, and games associated with the town's founding.  
- Mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment—[Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md)'s band—are training Vogler's small militia. They're also participating in a reenactment of the Battle of High Hill this afternoon.  

Once Darrett stops at the Fishbowl and purchases hand pies for everyone, he leads the characters to Thornwall Keep.

#### Establishing Darrett

Throughout this adventure, Darrett will be the characters' earnest friend and ally. He's clever, eager to please, and a little starstruck by the characters. He always has their best interests in mind. Portray him as reliable and with whatever quirks your players are likely to find charming. Establish Darrett's trustworthiness now so the characters know they can rely on him when it matters later.

#### Darrett Highwater

[Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) (lawful good, human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)) is a fastidious, aspiring knight who serves [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md). His parents abandoned him in town over a decade ago, after which Darrett spent years as a ward of the community before coming under Becklin's wing. In the years since, his good heart and aptitude for strategic thinking led Becklin to train him for induction into the Knights of Solamnia one day. Darrett is well-read and courteous, though he sometimes catches himself talking in ways he considers less than knightly, for which he apologizes profusely.

##### Personality Trait

"My mind sometimes works faster than I can talk, and I often second-guess myself."

##### Ideal

"My honor is my life."

##### Bond

"As Becklin's student, I'm trying to learn everything I can from such a hero."

##### Flaw

"Though I understand military strategy, I'm inexperienced at command and have a hard time delegating."

### Thornwall Keep

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Veins of bronze-colored ivy cling to Thornwall Keep's ancient three-story stone tower, the tallest structure in Vogler. From its crenelated roof rises an elaborate device resembling a catapult. Crumbling ruins of walls and other fallen structures surround the keep, and amid them lie several shallow square pits and covered excavation sites.
^113

Though it's no longer a working fortress, Thornwall Keep remains a sturdy structure and an emblem of Vogler's past. As the characters arrive, Becklin meets them at the door in a simple shirt and breeches, welcoming them inside to her first-floor library.

If Darrett is with the characters, he distributes the hand pies he bought for breakfast. If he's not, he arrives soon after the characters and does the same. Becklin readily makes small talk about the keep, the excavations she's conducting on the grounds, and the device on the roof—all detailed in the "Vogler Gazetteer" section.

#### The Green Shield

After their breakfast, Becklin steps away to her quarters for a moment. When she returns, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Becklin reenters the room carrying a shallow wooden box, approximately three feet to a side. She sets it down gently on a table. "Ispin left this for all of you," she explains. "But it comes with a condition. Since he won't be attending the Kingfisher Festival this year, he wanted you all to participate for him. Specifically, he hoped you'd take his place during the reenactment of the Battle of High Hill. Every year, he looked forward to participating—and dying—in an even more ludicrous way than the year before."
> 
> Becklin smiles at the memory as she opens the box, revealing a round green shield.
^115

The box contains Ispin's signature shield, a [+1 shield](Mechanics/items/1-shield.md) carved with a scarred broadleaf tree and painted a mossy green. The characters all recall hearing Ispin's story of being given the shield by a unicorn in the far-off forest of Darken Wood. None can say if this is true or another of Ispin's tall tales.

Becklin gives the characters the shield only if at least one of them agrees to participate in the Battle of High Hill reenactment. She leaves it to the group to decide which character keeps the shield or how they share it.

If the characters have been pleasant, Becklin is happy to chat some more before she tells them she has to prepare for the Kingfisher Festival. Darrett eagerly suggests going to the festival alongside the characters.

## The Kingfisher Festival

When the characters return to town after visiting Thornwall Keep, the Kingfisher Festival is in full swing. Happy villagers drift from their homes toward the sounds of laughter and upbeat music at the village circle. The characters arrive at the center of town, by following either Darrett's lead or the flow of traffic, just in time to hear Mayor [Raven Uth Vogler](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/raven-uth-vogler-dsotdq.md) address the crowd:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Colorful banners and paper decorations shaped like kingfishers decorate the village circle. Temporary stalls sell food and colorful crafts, and in the center of the circle, an ancient tree provides shade for happy picnickers. From a temporary stage, a band of local musicians brings a spirited song to a close as Mayor [Raven Uth Vogler](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/raven-uth-vogler-dsotdq.md) takes the stage.
> 
> "Welcome, friends!" the mayor begins, raising her arms high. "Welcome to the Kingfisher Festival!"
> 
> Cheers and applause fill the circle. The mayor smiles widely. "Today is a day of not only revelry but also reflection. We are all here thanks to the courage of heroes who came before us. Let us honor our founders, our family, and all those who can't be here to celebrate today. Enjoy your festival, Vogler, with good spirits, good times, and good friends! And look to the kingfishers for good luck!"
> 
> An energetic round of cheers follows the mayor's words. With that, the Kingfisher Festival is officially underway.
^117

Vogler's village circle is the heart of the Kingfisher Festival's events. Here, townsfolk share food and drink while a rotating series of enthusiastic local musicians take to the stage and encourage the crowd to dance. From the various stalls in the circle, characters can buy a variety of fish-filled pastries, sweet drinks, and kingfisher-shaped crafts for 3 cp each.

### Festivities

![The people of Vogler celeb...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/043-03-006.kingfisher-festival.webp#center "The people of Vogler celebrate during the Kingfisher Festival")

Traditional Kingfisher Festival events commemorate Vogler's founding and history. Characters might participate in an annual competition, the season's inaugural fish catch, where fishers try to catch the biggest fish during a set period. Darrett and other friendly locals encourage the characters to participate.

Characters can also carouse in the village circle, volunteer to perform on the festival stage, or socialize with locals. Any villager from the "Vogler Gazetteer" section might interact with the characters at the festival.

Whenever you please, transition to the "Battle of High Hill" section.

#### Fish Catch

Traffic flows steadily from the village circle to the wharf. Here, the fish catch pits amateur fishers against the community's best anglers, all competing to catch the largest fish. Characters who go to the wharf are invited to participate in this popular event and, if they accept, are lent fishing poles and bait. At the end of each 30-minute contest, participants are given charming but valueless trophies; bragging rights are the real prize at stake.

Should characters choose to participate, they find one of Vogler's best fishers, Mayor Raven, is in their group, along with a dozen other locals. Read the following description when the characters have their fishing gear prepared and are ready to start:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fishing pole resting on her shoulder, Raven takes her place as one of the competitors and beckons other participants to line up with her along the docks. "It's time to find out who among us kingfisher fisherfolk is the fisher king!" the mayor says as she casts her line into the Vingaard River. The competitors receive her pun with good-spirited groans and laughter, then cast their lines as well.
^11a

##### Running the Contest

The contest plays out in three 10-minute rounds. After a character spends 10 minutes fishing, roll on the Fish to Catch table to determine whether a fish tugs on their line and, if so, the DC of the Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check required to catch it. The character then makes a Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, catching the fish if they succeed and losing it if they fail. A character has advantage on this check if they brought their own fishing gear to the contest rather than borrowing gear. If a character fails this check by 10 or more, they are pulled into the water and are out of the contest.

Repeat these rolls for every 10 minutes a character participates in the fish catch. After 30 minutes, the contest ends and a winner is determined.

**Fish to Catch**

`dice: [](04-chapter-3-when-home-burns.md#^fish-to-catch)`

| dice: d20 | Catch DC | Fish |
|-----------|----------|------|
| 1–3 | — | No fish |
| 4–7 | 8 | Tiny river eel (1 ft. long) |
| 8–11 | 10 | Tiny cuirassed carp (1 ft. long) |
| 12–15 | 11 | Mature river eel (1½ ft. long) |
| 16–18 | 12 | Mature cuirassed carp (3 ft. long) |
| 19 | 15 | Greater cuirassed carp (5 ft. long) |
| 20 | 18 | Benebog the Line Breaker (8 ft. long) |
^fish-to-catch

![Raven Uth Vogler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/044-03-007.raven-uth-vogler.webp#center)

##### Benebog the Line Breaker

This enormous cuirassed carp is a Vogler legend. Even sighting Benebog is considered good luck, and catching it makes a fisher an instant town legend. Benebog can be caught only once. If a character rolls a 20 on the Fish to Catch table after Benebog has been caught, a greater cuirassed carp tugs on their line instead.

##### Contest Winner

The winner is determined by totaling the length of all fish each participant caught. Mayor Raven's catch totals 7 feet, followed by a villager whose catch totals 5 feet. The participant with the highest total is the winner. Participants then receive prizes.

##### Contest Prizes

All contest participants receive tiny wooden carvings of kingfishers, while the winner receives their choice of a blue knit cap or a fishing fly made from blue feathers. These prizes are charmingly made but have no significant value. Should a character catch Benebog, the mayor gives the character an exceptionally crafted fishing pole carved with kingfishers, worth 50 gp. Additionally, for the rest of the day, the villagers laud the character with congratulations and free drinks.

##### Repeat Contests

Characters can participate in the fish catch as many times as they like. On future rounds, the best villager catches fish totaling `1d4 + 3` feet. Mayor Raven doesn't participate again.

##### Bad Sport

Lord Bakaris drinks heavily during the festival and spends much of his time on the wharf, watching the fish catch and grumbling about how boring it is. He stands near the most competent-looking character participating in the contest and mockingly asks why they enjoy such a ridiculous pastime. (The "Castle Kalaman" section in chapter 4 presents more information on roleplaying Lord Bakaris.) For as long as Lord Bakaris is present, the character he's haranguing has disadvantage on Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks made during the fish catch. Characters can make Lord Bakaris go away by roleplaying or succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

## Betrayal at High Hill

The Kingfisher Festival culminates in the annual reenactment of the Battle of High Hill, held at a hill located about a 30-minute walk north of the village. The reenactment, which also serves as a drill for Vogler's militia, is followed by a feast at the Brass Crab.

The event is scheduled to begin in the afternoon. About an hour before, Mayor Raven rallies Vogler's militia in the village circle. The militia then leads a haphazard parade from town to High Hill, followed by dozens of spectators and a wagon filled with drinks for participants.

Darrett, Becklin, or another villager finds the characters as the parade begins and encourages the party to walk with them. If the characters agreed to honor Ispin's last wishes, they easily find the other participants gathering at High Hill, either at the direction of this villager or by following momentum from the parade.

### Behind the Battle

This year's reenactment is a little different than in past years. Should the characters chat with Darrett or other locals during the walk to High Hill, they learn the following information:

- This mock battle reenacts the Knights of Solamnia's ancient victory over enemy forces from the eastern nation of Istar. The battle was led by Lord Vogler, a noble knight and the village's founder.  
- This year, Mayor Raven arranged for a friend of the town, the mercenary leader [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md), to participate. Cudgel's Ironclad Regiment is playing the part of the invading Istarian forces. The mayor claims it's a happy coincidence Cudgel's band was in the area during the event.  
- Mayor Raven has given the village's militia a lot of attention recently. Some villagers think she hired Cudgel to visit Vogler and help with this event—possibly because of vague rumors of war in the east. With trained mercenaries on the opposing side, this year's reenactment could be more of a challenge for the militia than in past years.  

### Betrayal

Unbeknownst to anyone in the village, Cudgel's lieutenant in the Ironclad Regiment—Gragonis (neutral evil [half-ogre](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/half-ogre-ogrillon.md)) has betrayed his leader. He has paid off many of the mercenaries under his command, and with the exception of Cudgel and a few mercenaries who aren't attending the reenactment, the entire company secretly plans to attack lethally during the mock battle

Agents of the Red Dragon Army—part of the greater army waging war in eastern Ansalon—hatched this plan when they learned the mercenaries would join in the mock battle. The commanders of the Red Dragon Army bought Gragonis's loyalty, and they seek to take Vogler quickly as part of a greater scheme.

A contingent of the Red Dragon Army slipped into the lands near Vogler and crossed the Vingaard River in recent days. The draconians the characters might have encountered in chapter 2 were part of this force. If Vogler can be taken by the traitorous members of the Ironclad Regiment, all the better. If it can't, the Dragon Army plans to bring its own devastating forces to bear.

### Preparing for Battle

When the characters and people of Vogler arrive at High Hill, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Passing through woods and fields, Vogler's parade of militia members and reenactment spectators finally reaches High Hill. The grassy slope is spotted with trees and crumbled stone fencing. Near the base, several dozen soldiers in matching armor stand in even formation. The contrast is striking between these mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment and Vogler's militia—with their mismatched armor and crooked helmets—but it does nothing to dampen the spirits of those assembled for the Kingfisher Festival's climactic reenactment.
^125

The parade follows a trail to the top of the hill, where Mayor Raven and [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) meet and discuss final preparations for the event. Soon, reenactment participants and spectators break up, with the former taking up wooden weapons while the latter settle down to watch the reenactment.

Encourage all characters to participate in the reenactment, if for no other reason than to honor Ispin Greenshield's last wishes. If a character refuses, Mayor Raven offers to pay them 5 gp to be a judge during the battle, making sure no one uses real weapons and calling for aid if someone gets hurt.

To prepare for the battle, Mayor Raven calls out to those assembled, explaining the mercenaries will charge up the west side of the hill while the militia and other participants charge down. The two groups will clash midway in a mock fight, with the mercenaries' Istarian forces eventually retreating. Participants are encouraged to use their own armor but are given wooden spears with padded tips to prevent them from dealing damage. The mayor reminds everyone not to use real weapons during the reenactment so nobody gets hurt.

Mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment use the [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block. Members of the Vogler militia also use the [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block, but their spears are padded and deal no damage.

### Battle Begins

When the characters are ready, Darrett or a militia member guides them into line with the other Vogler troops. Read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After much laughter and jostling, the mayor, Cudgel, and other spectators walk to a nearby vantage to watch. As they do, the militia takes up its position atop High Hill—the same hill Solamnic troops held centuries ago. They face the mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment at the base of the hill, arrayed as the forces of Istar once were. Although the event is only a reenactment, a tingle of excitement fills the field. Somewhere on the line, a reenactor hoots and yells, "Let's send those Istarian rats running!"
> 
> A moment later, a trumpet blast signals the start of the battle. "For Istar!" yells the mercenaries' leader, a tall half-ogre among several mounted soldiers. The mock Istarian troops assault the hill. Around you, the Vogler militia charges to meet them.
^127

As the two groups charge, have each character make a Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The character who rolls the highest notices the sun glinting off the mercenaries' spear tips and their half-ogre leader gesturing with a steel axe. Regardless of how the characters react to this, it's too late to stop the attack. The mounted mercenaries lead their forces in a charge up the hill. When they clash with the militia members, an actual battle begins.

### Battle of High Hill

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The unexpected sound of metal clashing on armor rings across the field, silencing laughter and melodramatic boasts. A ribbon of red splashes over the grassy hill, followed by shocked screams. Any pretense of a reenactment shatters—High Hill is the site of a true battle once more. Within moments, all around you, armed mercenaries attack unprepared villagers fighting for their lives.
^129

The characters find themselves in the middle of a battlefield. Map 3.2 depicts the characters' location during the conflict; they start the battle adjacent to the log at the north of the map. The "High Hill Battlefield Features" and "High Hill Battlefield Events" sections note elements of this battle.

The characters have little opportunity to aid the villagers being attacked as three hostile mercenary [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), each mounted on a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md), appear on the road at the southwest edge of the battlefield and focus their attacks on the characters.

If Darrett or another well-liked NPC accompanied the characters to the hill, they may be wounded during combat but should survive the battle. Other spectators, like Mayor Raven and Cudgel, are far enough away that they won't reach the battlefield until after the fight ends.

After these mercenaries are defeated, proceed with the "Gragonis Arrives" encounter.

> [!note] Battlefield Encounters
> 
> The "Battle of High Hill" section presents the first of several battlefield encounters in this adventure. These are events that take place on active battlefields. During these scenes, the wider battle is abstracted, allowing the characters focus on specific, tide-turning conflicts.
> 
> At the edge of each mapped battlefield encounter and beyond is a region called the Fray. The Fray is an interpretation of the dangers of combat, from clashing combatants to deadly spells. It is also the source of additional threats. Each battlefield encounter explains the Fray's effects and presents additional dangers that might occur at the end of each round of combat. A battlefield encounter ends when noted in the text.
^battlefield-encounters

#### High Hill Battlefield Features

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 3.2: Battle of High Hill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/045-map-3.02-battle-of-high-hill.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/046-map-3.02-battle-of-high-hill-player.webp#gallery)

The battlefield, shown on map 3.2, has the following features:

- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents dozens of clashing combatants. This area and the battlefield beyond the map are "difficult terrain". A creature that enters the Fray for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) slashing damage from opportunistic foes. The Fray can't be damaged and remains until the battle ends.  
- **Wall and Cart.** Both the stone walls and the supply cart are "difficult terrain". They grant "half cover" to creatures behind them.  

#### High Hill Battlefield Events

During this encounter, roll on the High Hill Battlefield Events table each round at initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table if a character enters the Fray or otherwise tries to leave the battlefield.

**High Hill Battlefield Events**

`dice: [](04-chapter-3-when-home-burns.md#^high-hill-battlefield-events)`

| dice: d4 | Events |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A volley of arrows falls on a random player character's position. That character and each creature within 10 feet of them must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage. |
| 2 | Two terrified, riderless warhorses bolt from the Fray. One random player character must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). The horses then dash off the battlefield. |
| 3 | An injured member of Vogler's militia (a [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) with 1 hit point) crawls onto the battlefield and begs for help, appearing in an unoccupied space adjacent to the Fray nearest a random character. |
| 4 | A hostile mercenary [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) with 6 hit points appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the Fray nearest a random mercenary on the battlefield. The guard takes their turn on initiative count 10. |
^high-hill-battlefield-events

#### Gragonis Arrives

As the characters prevail against the mounted guards, or whenever it feels appropriate, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A hulking figure swinging a formidable battleaxe leads a band of mercenaries through the chaos. He cuts through the few remaining members of Vogler's militia as he draws closer.
^12e

The [half-ogre](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/half-ogre-ogrillon.md) Gragonis emerges at the west edge of the battlefield adjacent to the Fray, along with four mercenaries (use the [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block). As he does, he points at the most formidable-looking character and laughs to his allies, "Look here! We got one who still thinks this is all a game!" Gragonis and the mercenaries then attack.

### Aftermath

After Gragonis and his four guards are defeated, the remaining mercenaries scatter and the battlefield encounter ends.

The mercenaries' retreat is further motivated by the arrival of their horrified commander, [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md), along with Mayor Raven, Becklin, and several burly spectators. The group has already seen some fighting, as treacherous mercenaries tried and failed to kill Cudgel at Gragonis's orders.

Anyone who accompanied the characters to the hill, like Darrett, also survived the battle, but almost all of Vogler's militia was wiped out.

If all the characters are defeated, Darrett or other surviving members of Vogler's militia drag them from danger and revive them. The characters awaken outside of battle with 1 hit point each just as Cudgel, Becklin, and Raven arrive.

### Response

Mayor Raven thanks the characters for defending her people, fearing things would have gone far worse if they hadn't. She promises to reward the characters, but at the moment, she's focused on treating the wounded and getting everyone back to Vogler safely.

#### Cudgel Betrayed

As the characters and Mayor Raven speak, [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) seeks answers. While the battle was taking place, one of her own mercenaries appeared and attacked her, only to be killed by Becklin. The typically unflappable mercenary commander is livid. It doesn't take her long to find one of her mercenaries who was wounded but survived the battle—possibly Gragonis, if the characters spared him. She angrily shakes and yells at the wounded mercenary. If the characters don't act first, Mayor Raven calms Cudgel and has the traitor bound for the walk back to Vogler where they can be interrogated (see the "Mercenary Interrogation" section).

#### Healing the Wounded

Most of Vogler's militia died during the battle, but if the characters search for wounded, they find a few souls in need of aid. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can bring a villager back from the brink of death. A character can also use healing magic to save a wounded villager by restoring 1 or more hit points. Any healed villager thanks their savior, giving the character a piece of jewelry or lucky charm worth 20 gp.

If a character openly uses the power of a god to save a villager, locals who see this are awed and consider it nothing less than a miracle. A villager saved in this way is particularly thankful and seeks to learn more about the character's deity.

#### Back to Vogler

After the wounded are tended to, Mayor Raven and Becklin urge the villagers to return to Vogler so they can organize a proper response. Raven and Becklin ask the characters to escort the villagers home safely in case of further threats, but the somber return trip to Vogler proves uneventful.

### Character Advancement

The characters advance to 3rd level after the battle at High Hill.

## Back in Vogler

After returning to Vogler, Mayor Raven, Cudgel, and Becklin ask the characters to join them at the Brass Crab as Darrett and other villagers tend to the wounded. The Kingfisher Festival's levity is abandoned as worried locals seek refuge or mill about the village circle, uncertain how to help.

The Brass Crab's owner, Yalme, had prepared the tavern's common room for a night of celebration, but those plans are quickly abandoned when the characters arrive with the village leaders. Mayor Raven leads the conversation, prioritizing the following points:

- Raven already instructed trusted villagers to tend to the wounded and to recover the bodies of those murdered at High Hill.  
- Raven wants to understand why the Ironclad Regiment attacked. Clearly Cudgel was betrayed, but why? The captive mercenary might have answers to these questions.  
- Vogler's leaders need to know whether other dangerous mercenaries are afoot.  
- If one of the characters used magic—particularly healing magic or other evidence of a god's power—Raven asks if the character can use their talents to help her people.  

Cudgel has only one concern: discovering the fate of the rest of her troops. She plans to return to her camp once the mercenary has been interrogated. She won't be deterred, and she refuses to let anyone go with her; if her mercenaries have betrayed her, she doesn't want anyone else walking into danger.

Let the characters pose their own concerns and plans, but ultimately the mayor urges everyone—except Cudgel—to stay in the village tonight as they try to learn more. In the meantime, Raven encourages the characters to join Cudgel in interrogating the surviving mercenary.

### Mercenary Interrogation

Unless the characters previously spared the life of a specific mercenary (such as Gragonis), the mercenary captured during the Battle of High Hill is a low-ranking [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) of the Ironclad Regiment named Svilnt Sunderlit.

Mayor Raven gives Cudgel and the characters leeway in conducting the interrogation. Raven doesn't oppose the use of coercive magic, but she refuses to let anyone harm the captive. Cudgel initially tries to lead the interrogation, but she struggles to contain her anger at her betrayal. She soon retreats to watch from a distance as the characters lead things—though she occasionally interjects at particularly angering news.

The captive mercenary is brought in with their chest and arms bound by a fishing net. At first, the mercenary only mocks the characters and refuses to reveal anything but their name. By coercing the captive through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the characters learn the following information:

- Gragonis planned to kill Cudgel and take control of the Ironclad Regiment.  
- Several days ago, Gragonis headed into the woods west of the mercenary camp, then returned with a considerable amount of gold.  
- Afterward, Gragonis hired his most loyal mercenaries to attack the Vogler militia during the reenactment. He planned to then raid Vogler.  
- The mercenary doesn't know who gave Gragonis the gold he used to pay off the mercenaries.  
- A few mercenaries remained at their camp, including Jeyev, Cudgel's other lieutenant. The mercenary thinks the others at the camp are loyal to Cudgel—the ones Gragonis paid accompanied him to the reenactment.  

If Gragonis is the mercenary being interrogated, he claims not to know who his benefactor was, other than they were hooded and wore black and red armor.

### A Tense Evening

When the characters are done questioning the mercenary, the captive is placed under guard in a nearby shed. Cudgel heads out soon after, intent on verifying the mercenary's story at her camp. She promises to return by the following dawn. The "Cudgel's Report" section details what Cudgel learns.

Mayor Raven is eager to learn more about Gragonis's meeting in the woods west of town, despite not wanting anyone else to leave the village. She plans to send out local hunters in the morning, but she responds with gratitude if the characters offer to investigate the woods instead. Raven offers to send Darrett with them as a guide—a task he eagerly agrees to.

## Sighting the Enemy

Either the night of or morning after the attack at High Hill, the characters (or experienced hunters from the village) head into the woods west of Vogler where Gragonis met with a mysterious sponsor. If villagers conduct this reconnaissance, they report back by midmorning with dire information, having learned everything the characters would in the following expedition.

If the characters go, they find a small wooded area an hour west of the village. A character who spends an hour searching the woods finds strange tracks. Some of these tracks are boot prints, while others are clawed reptilian feet the characters can't identify. The tracks wind north through the woods.

Following the tracks takes more than an hour, leading the characters from the woods into rugged hills. In a valley, they see the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The woods give way to a ledge overlooking a shallow valley. In the distance, dozens of low fires illuminate hundreds of red tents. Among them move patrols of shadowy, humanlike figures. Over a thousand soldiers occupy the camp—a whole army.
^139

This is a camp of Red Dragon Army soldiers. Should the characters attempt to approach the camp, a patrol of three [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) and two [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) draws near (see appendix B for both stat blocks). The draconians are hooded and look like Humanoid soldiers from afar, but a character who engages in melee combat with them discovers their true nature. If attacked, one draconian attempts to flee to camp and raise an alarm.

Use more draconians to prevent the characters from drawing close to the camp. Even if the camp is alerted to the characters' presence, the draconians don't follow the characters to Vogler.

Ultimately, when the characters or other scouts return to Vogler, they should have learned the following information:

- A significant military force is camped several miles northwest of the village.  
- The force looks well organized and has vigilant patrols.  
- The soldiers are a mix of humans and other hooded figures. If the characters encountered them up close, they know these hooded figures have wings and reptilian features.  

## A Fateful Morning

Mayor Raven spends the night and next morning conferring with members of the community in the common room of the Brass Crab. The morning after the battle at High Hill, two things happen:

- The characters (or local scouts) return with news of an armed camp.  
- [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) returns with information from the mercenary camp.  

### Camp Reconnaissance

When the characters or other scouts return to Vogler, they're directed to report to Mayor Raven, who has been at the Brass Crab with Becklin and other concerned villagers all night. Raven is shocked by the report about the enemy camp. She wants to know more about the nature and disposition of this force, and she's aware Vogler can't defend itself against anything more than a few raiders. She's eager to hear advice from the characters and others about how to address this potential threat.

At the outset, Raven is inclined to draft a letter to the commander of the camp to declare Vogler's neutrality in all conflicts, ask the mysterious army's intentions, and welcome them to meet with the mayor. But before the mayor can develop a plan further, Cudgel returns.

### Cudgel's Report

[Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) returns to Vogler accompanied by the lieutenant of her scouts, the human [Jeyev Veldrews](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jeyev-veldrews-dsotdq.md). Cudgel shares the following information:

- She believes Jeyev and her remaining troops are loyal to her—they could have easily overpowered her if they weren't.  
- On her return, Cudgel found Jeyev and other loyal mercenaries had heard of the events at High Hill. They had restrained several soldiers loyal to Gragonis but who didn't have orders to participate in the reenactment.  
- During the night, Jeyev's scouts came across a large military force to the northwest of the village, much too large and organized to be a mere mercenary band. This is the same army the characters likely spotted, and Jeyev's scouts can confirm everything from the "Sighting the Enemy" section.  

![Jeyev Veldrews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/047-03-008.jeyev-veldrews.webp#center)

### Vogler's Response

Allow the characters, in consultation with the village leaders, to determine how Vogler should respond to the mysterious army. Becklin, Cudgel, and Raven take the following positions:

- **Becklin Uth Viharin.** The knight is deeply concerned. She's heard rumors of strange armies in the east, and now there's a strange army close to her home. As the most experienced military leader in the room, she expects the worst, but she's trying not to panic anyone.  
- **Cudgel Ironsmile.** Cudgel feels responsible for everything at High Hill. She gives the village the complete support of the Ironclad Regiment. She favors a peaceful response to the mysterious army, but one backed by her mercenaries' spears.  
- **Mayor Raven Uth Vogler.** The mayor will do anything to keep her people safe. However, she wants more information before acting.  

To further complicate the situation, Lord Bakaris joins the group mid-conversation, insulted that he hasn't been involved in what are clearly important discussions. However, he has no idea what the discussions are about. Bakaris cares nothing for the safety of the village, but he posits ideas that make him look important without requiring any actual effort.

Allow the characters to guide the decision of Vogler's leaders, who will largely support any plan that doesn't involve a preemptive strike or bringing battle into the village.

### Voice of War

However the characters choose to respond to the army near Vogler, their plans are derailed by unexpected visitors. As the characters prepare, a messenger in black-and-red armor arrives at the River Gate. Villagers are the first to spot the messenger, and they alert the mayor and the characters.

When Mayor Raven and the characters arrive at the River Gate, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beneath the carvings of leaping fish etched into Vogler's open wooden gate, a human in black-and-red scale mail sits astride an armored warhorse. She holds out a rolled parchment and calls out, "Who among you speaks for this village?"
^13f

This [Dragon Army soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) astride a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) is a messenger from the Red Dragon Army. If a character doesn't speak up first, Raven steps forward and takes the messenger's letter. The message reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> People of Vogler,
> 
> By the orders of [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), the Voice of Takhisis, you will quarter the soldiers of the invincible Red Dragon Army this night. Refuse and die.
> 
> This is the Dragon Queen's will.
^140

Characters proficient in [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion) recognize the name Takhisis as one of the gods of Krynn. A cleric of Takhisis or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes a spiral symbol on the messenger's armor as a symbol of Takhisis, the greatest of the evil gods, who is also known as the Dragon Queen. This same symbol appears on all Dragon Army armor.

The messenger demands the village prepare to be occupied by Dragon Army troops that evening. In the meantime, nobody can leave the village. If the characters press the messenger for more information, she provides none. If threatened, the soldier holds her ground and gives a signal. Atop the 30-foot-tall cliffs to the east of the gate, four [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) appear (see appendix B). They use their javelins to attack anyone who threatens the messenger or who tries to leave the village.

Mayor Raven seeks to avoid bloodshed and encourages the characters to withdraw.

### Resistance

The appearance of the Red Dragon Army soldiers answers many questions about the force near Vogler. Back at the Brass Crab, Mayor Raven consults with the characters, Becklin, and Cudgel. Raven sees no other option than to do as the message demands and welcome the Dragon Army. Becklin and Cudgel immediately oppose this, having witnessed the horrors of occupying forces.

Let the characters propose plans to keep the Dragon Army at bay. If they don't suggest using the Ironclad Regiment to defend the town, Cudgel suggests it. As the mercenaries are camped north of the village, bringing them to Vogler without alerting the Dragon Army likely requires getting rid of the Dragon Army soldiers at the gate—a challenge while the soldiers hold the upper ground.

If the characters wish to sneak up on the Dragon Army soldiers, they have two options, both described in the sections that follow.

#### On the Cliffs

The simplest way to reach the Dragon Army soldiers is to climb the northeastern cliffs and sneak up on them. Taking a boat downriver, landing, and sneaking back is also a viable option.

The area atop the cliffs is wooded, but an open field lies below and behind the soldiers' position. Scaling the 30-foot-tall cliffs is simple enough, but unless they are distracted, the soldiers notice anyone climbing the cliff or approaching from another direction. If the characters reach the top of the cliff, they find four [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B).

#### The Gnomeflinger

![Gnomeflinger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/048-03-009.gnomeflinger.webp#center)

Thornwall Keep sits directly across from the Dragon Army soldiers' clifftop vantage. Atop Thornwall Keep sits the creation of the tinker gnome Than: a people-launching device called a gnomeflinger (described in appendix A). If using the gnomeflinger comes up, Becklin or Darrett suggests consulting with Than first.

Than is overjoyed to let the characters use the gnomeflinger. They're so delighted that they forget they also have several safety devices called [narycrashes](Mechanics/items/narycrash-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A). Than mentions the narycrashes only if a character raises concerns about landing after using the gnomeflinger. Than has enough narycrashes for each character to get one.

Should the characters use the gnomeflinger, it proves surprisingly effective and quiet, allowing the characters to [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) the four [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) atop the cliffs.

### Dealing with the Soldiers

If the characters confront the Dragon Army soldiers on the cliffs, the messenger attempts to retreat to the Dragon Army camp on her warhorse rather than aiding her allies. With the Dragon Army soldiers gone, Cudgel is eager to ride out to meet her mercenaries. She plans to bring them back to a defensible position just north of the village. If the characters don't attack the Dragon Army soldiers on the cliffs, skip to the "Preparing for the Worst" section.

### Preparing for the Worst

Whether the characters drive off the Dragon Army soldiers or make other plans within town, Mayor Raven eventually seeks the characters' council in determining how best to protect the villagers. During this conversation, Becklin, Cudgel, and Raven take the following positions:

- **Becklin Uth Viharin.** Becklin has grown quiet. She wants to speak privately to the characters and Darrett after they've conferred with Mayor Raven and Cudgel (see the "Becklin's Fear" section).  
- **Cudgel Ironsmile.** Cudgel wants only to get her troops and bring them back to Vogler. Even if they're outnumbered, fighting is the only option in her mind.  
- **Mayor Raven Uth Vogler.** If the characters attacked the Dragon Army soldiers, Mayor Raven is grappling with the fact they just started a war. Otherwise, she's frustrated by the situation and seeks advice on how to protect her people by nightfall. She refuses any suggestion involving fighting in the village.  

If the characters suggest they prepare to evacuate Vogler, the mayor initially dismisses the idea, but a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces her it's in the village's best interest. Becklin agrees and shares the information in the "Becklin's Fear" section. The mayor doesn't like it but grudgingly accepts it's the only option.

If not deterred, Cudgel and Jeyev either ride or sneak out of Vogler to rally their mercenaries.

#### Becklin's Fear

If the characters don't suggest preparing Vogler for evacuation, Becklin pulls them and Darrett aside for a private conversation. She shares the following concerns:

- Becklin has heard about war and unstoppable armies in the east. She fears these Red Dragon Army soldiers are part of that greater force.  
- She's lived in Vogler for decades and knows its people aren't soldiers. They'd need weeks of training and a hundred more professional soldiers to stand a chance in any conflict.  
- She suggests readying the villagers to evacuate at a moment's notice in case other plans fail.  
- Evacuees can follow the river to safety in Kalaman (detailed below).  

Becklin asks the characters to help convince Mayor Raven of this idea. If the characters already suggested this idea to the mayor, Becklin supports them, adding the points here to the argument. If both the characters and Becklin advocate for evacuating the village, Mayor Raven begrudgingly agrees.

Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check or who ask a resident of Vogler about the city of Kalaman can any of the information from the "Knowledge of Kalaman" section at the start of chapter 4.

### Planning to Evacuate

Once the village leaders agree to prepare for evacuation, the people of Vogler have much to do. Becklin focuses on getting information about the Red Dragon Army and shoring up local defenses. Mayor Raven asks for the characters' and Darrett's help organizing the evacuation, tasking them with the following:

- Help her inform the villagers of the situation by collecting everyone in the village circle.  
- Assess how many ships the village has and roughly how many villagers they can carry.  
- Instruct the villagers how to get to safety.  
- Keep the villagers calm.  

Mayor Raven and Darrett cooperate with any plans the characters have, as long as they clearly help prepare for escape and don't risk any villagers' lives. However, the mayor doesn't want to start the evacuation until absolutely necessary, allowing villagers time to prepare and safely evacuate together.

#### Informing the Villagers

The characters can easily summon most of Vogler's people to the village circle, likely by going door to door or by ringing the village circle's bell. When the villagers have gathered, Mayor Raven addresses the crowd. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Colorful Kingfisher Festival decorations still cover the village circle and the festival stage. Unlike the day before, the people collected in the village center are somber, muttering in worried tones as Mayor Raven takes the stage.
> 
> The mayor doesn't mince words: "A dangerous army is headed for Vogler. The Ironclad Regiment will do what it can to defend Vogler, but we must be ready to flee."
> 
> Following the mayor's report, the locals stand in stunned silence. Then their questions come in a wave of shouting, anger, and fear.
^149

With a successful DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the characters can help the mayor regain control of the crowd by speaking in support or explaining evacuation plans. Otherwise, it takes the mayor over an hour to placate the community and get evacuation preparations underway.

At your discretion, Lord Bakaris or [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) might speak out and try to undermine the mayor and the characters. If so, the villagers reject the evacuation plans until a character counters Bakaris by roleplaying or succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

Once the villagers have accepted the evacuation plans, they assist Mayor Raven, Darrett, and the characters in preparing to evacuate to Kalaman, understanding time is short.

#### Short Ship Supply

A character who spends an hour inspecting the ships in Vogler's wharf estimates the vessels there could transport only two hundred of the village's four hundred residents. Let the characters concoct ways to solve this problem. If they don't initially have ideas, characters can make skill checks to identify solutions like the following. A character proficient with water vehicles makes these checks with advantage.

##### Boat Made of Boats

A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check formulates a plan to use rope and rings of small boats to corral floating masses of logs, creating several large rafts capable of holding two hundred more villagers. With the help of locals, this simple plan takes three hours to complete.

##### Personal Fleet

If a character asks Vogler's fishers for help and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the character can convince the villagers to lend their personal vessels to the evacuation: boats in need of simple repairs, boats collecting dust in villagers' sheds, and even boats serving as decorations in homes. Given two hours, the villagers can find enough boats to fit one hundred more people.

##### Repurposed Ferry

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices the ferry crossing on the Vingaard River has a series of rafts and small boats on a pulley system. The mechanism can be broken down in two hours, freeing up vessels for one hundred people.

#### Battle Plans

Early in the afternoon, Cudgel returns to Vogler. She shares the following information:

- Cudgel has directed the Ironclad Regiment to hold a position north of the village. The mercenaries believe they can, for a time, defend against a larger force.  
- She hopes they won't have to fight. With any luck, a show of force will convince the Dragon Army that Vogler isn't an easy target.  
- Just in case, her soldiers set up a small rear command tent near the River Gate. She's posted a messenger there so the village can send word to her troops as needed.  
- She asks Becklin to join her at the front. She hopes if a Knight of Solamnia appears on the field, the enemy will hesitate to provoke the knighthood.  

Mayor Raven and Becklin support Cudgel's choices, and the knight agrees with her friend's plan.

##### Defenders of Vogler

This plan leaves the village and its escape operation undefended except for the handful of remaining militia members and a few tough fishers. Becklin and Cudgel ask the characters and Darrett to remain in the village with the mayor. They want to ensure that if any enemies get past the Ironclad Regiment, the villagers have protection.

#### Becklin's Request

During the conversation about battle plans, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) score realizes Becklin is keeping something back. She won't say anything in front of Cudgel, Mayor Raven, or Darrett, but if approached in private, she thanks the character and asks them to do her a favor. A large wooden box is under her bed in Thornwall Keep. She doesn't tell them what it holds but asks the characters to fetch the box and give it to Darrett once he safely escapes town.

The characters can easily retrieve the box from Becklin's quarters at any point before the "Invasion Encounters" section. The sturdy wooden box weighs about 70 pounds and bears no markings other than a simple kingfisher emblem on the lid. If the characters open the box, they find it holds a suit of Solamnic plate armor.

If the characters follow Becklin's instructions, they won't give the box to Darrett until after the evacuation. If they instead do so before leaving town, see the "Darrett's Armor" section in chapter 4.

### The Enemy Sighted

After Cudgel has returned and the characters have organized Vogler's evacuation, a local farmer rides into the village circle. The farmer reports seeing hundreds of soldiers on the road, headed toward Vogler. The adventure unfolds in one of two ways from here:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you are using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game along with this adventure, consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 1" sidebar.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the "Invasion of Vogler" section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 1
> 
> With the Red Dragon Army on its way, [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md) summons the characters to Cudgel's command tent at the village's edge. When they arrive, read the introduction to scenario 1 in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*, then play that scenario. This scenario details an organized defense of Vogler and the characters' desperate attempt to get the villagers to safety.
> 
> If the characters attain a win or hold during this scenario, each character gains "inspiration". Additionally, after the people of Vogler have reached safety, they recognize the characters as honorary members of the village and the mayor gifts them one of the community's few treasures: a folded paper kingfisher that functions as a [Quaal's feather token (bird)](Mechanics/items/quaals-feather-token-bird.md). Characters gain no rewards for a loss.
> 
> At the end of the scenario, Darrett is reeling from Becklin's defeat and returns with the characters to Vogler. You can run any encounters from the "Invasion of Vogler" section as the characters escape the village, or you can skip ahead to "The Final Boat" section.
^warriors-of-krynn-scenario-1

## Invasion of Vogler

Before Becklin and Cudgel leave Vogler to join the Ironclad Regiment, Becklin shares a brief, formal goodbye with Darrett. She then thanks the characters for all they've done, saying, "Ispin was right to call you friends. I'm glad I've had the chance to do the same." Becklin and Cudgel then ride out.

An hour passes before news arrives. In the meantime, keep the characters occupied with the evacuation's preparations, such as finding missing villagers and corralling ships.

### News from the Front

When you're ready to begin this section, give the characters a reason to be near the River Gate, such as fetching Becklin's box from Thornwall Keep or looking for a lost villager. When the characters are within earshot, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Pounding hooves sound from the direction of the River Gate as a mercenary of the Ironclad Regiment rides toward the village circle. As she nears, she yells, "They're coming! Evacuate now! The Dragon Ar—" The message is cut short as a squat, hooded figure launches from the nearby clifftops and slams into the rider's back, sending horse and rider tumbling.
^155

The rider is a [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) sent by Becklin to alert Vogler to evacuate immediately. When the characters arrive, the rider's horse is dead and she is locked in battle with her attacker, a [baaz draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). The draconian kills her if the characters don't intercede.

If the characters save the rider, she announces that an attack is imminent—the Dragon Army has split into two prongs. One went to engage the mercenaries, while the second is headed to the village.

### Perilous Evacuation

It's up to the characters to decide how to handle the incoming invasion. Unless the characters made other plans, Mayor Raven and Darrett are at the village's wharf with most of the villagers. After learning the scout's news, Mayor Raven orders the evacuation to begin. Read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The villagers remain eerily quiet as they begin lowering themselves into the boats. Panic washes over the crowd as cloaked figures emerge at the edge of the cliff above Vogler. The figures linger for a moment, then step off the edge. Wings sweep from beneath their cloaks, slowing their descent into the village.
^157

As invaders sweep over the cliff into Vogler, Darrett draws his sword and asks the characters to help him defend the escaping villagers.

### Invasion Encounters

Vogler is swiftly overwhelmed by Dragon Army draconians. Roll on or choose encounters from the Vogler Invasion Encounters table. Set these encounters anywhere in the village you wish.

After the second encounter, the characters hear loud clanking sounds from the north—something large and metal is moving toward them. This is the [boilerdrak](Mechanics/objects/boilerdrak-dsotdq.md) they'll encounter in the "Escape from Vogler" section. Before the characters can investigate the noise, a third encounter distracts them.

When you've run at least three of these encounters, proceed with the "Escape from Vogler" section.

**Vogler Invasion Encounters**

^vogler-invasion-encounters

#### Airborne Assassin

A [kapak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) glides overhead from the cliffs, intent on dropping onto one of the characters. Only characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher notice it. Unless alerted, the other characters are surprised when the kapak attacks.

#### Direct Attack

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From between buildings sprint five cloaked invaders, their clawed feet gouging the dirt. They wave torches and fierce blades above their reptilian heads.
^15b

Five [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) charge toward the wharf, intent on setting buildings ablaze and murdering escaping villagers. In their frenzied state, the draconians fight to the death.

#### Ominous Riders

The character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score glimpses the following scene during the invasion:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A distant flash of light catches your attention. Atop the cliffs north of town, three figures on motionless horses sit in the shadows of the trees. You make out the glint of light on plate armor, but before you can alert your companions, the figures vanish.
^15d

Three mysterious knights watch the battle, but they disappear as soon as they're spotted. If the character who noticed them succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check, they recognize the figures as wearing the antiquated armor of Knights of Solamnia. Who these knights are—skeletal knights, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and his retinue, or the spirits of Lord Vogler and his knights—is up to you.

#### Vogler Militia

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The sound of clashing metal draws your attention. Two of Vogler's remaining militia members struggle to hold their own against reptile-headed invaders. The scaled soldiers bait the militia members, hissing cruel laughter.
^15f

The two militia members ([guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) are outmatched by five [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). If the characters don't intervene quickly, the militia members are slaughtered. If the characters help and a militia member lives, this survivor gives the characters a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).

### Escape from Vogler

When you're ready to bring the invasion of Vogler to its climax, proceed with this encounter. No matter where the characters are in the village, screams ring out from the wharf. When the characters draw close, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The screams of villagers, still evacuating onto boats, ring through the smoke of burning buildings. Among the screams rises an unbelievable word: "Dragon!"
> 
> Then it comes into view. Pitching this way and that, its scales clanking like steel plates, a black beast draws near the wharf, flanked by reptilian invaders. Flames crackle from the beast's gaping maw.
^161

Despite its appearance, the thing nearing Vogler's wharf isn't a dragon—it's a boilerdrak, a gnomish siege engine invented for the Red Dragon Army (see appendix A). The boilerdrak is crewed by four [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B).

This battle takes place in front of Vogler's wharf, depicted on map 3.3. The "Vogler Battlefield Features" and "Vogler Battlefield Events" sections detail elements of this battle. The boilerdrak is positioned on the scorched ground. The characters start the battle anywhere on the wharf.

On the first round of battle, three draconians use their actions to load, aim, and fire the boilerdrak at the Wharfinger's Office—the structure at the north of the map. The building rapidly catches fire.

Characters who succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or who come within 5 feet of the boilerdrak recognize it isn't a dragon, but a mechanical device.

After the baaz draconians are defeated, proceed with the "Fewmaster Gholcag" encounter.

#### Vogler Battlefield Features

The battlefield includes the following features:

- **Burning Building.** The Wharfinger's Office is on fire. A creature that enters the burning structure for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) fire damage.  
- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents draconians facing off against Vogler's remaining defenders. This area and the village beyond the map are "difficult terrain". A creature that enters the Fray for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) slashing damage from opportunistic foes. The Fray can't be damaged and remains until the battle ends.

#### Fewmaster Gholcag

After the boilerdrak's baaz draconians are defeated, the commander of the draconian assault arrives. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud]

> An exterior wall of the Brass Crab shatters outward. A ten-foot-tall brute in black scale armor emerges from the inn. Holding a barrel of fish under one arm, the hulking figure fills her mouth with a fistful of wriggling fish.
> 
> From behind her, two reptilian soldiers emerge. "Them next," the ogre says, gesturing in your direction. The soldiers move forward obediently.
^165

[Fewmaster Gholcag](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fewmaster-gholcag-dsotdq.md) is a low-ranking commander in the Red Dragon Army and the leader of the raid on Vogler. She and two [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) arrive adjacent to the Fray along the northernmost road. [Fewmaster Gholcag](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/fewmaster-gholcag-dsotdq.md) uses the [ogre](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) stat block, but she wears scale mail and has AC 14. She and the draconians fight to the death.

After Gholcag and the draconians are defeated, the battlefield encounter ends.

### The Final Boat

Most of the draconians remaining in Vogler focus on looting the village, giving the villagers enough time to evacuate. At the end of the pier, only Mayor Raven, Darrett, and a few others have yet to board a boat. The remaining boats have enough space for them and the characters.

Before the characters head to their boats, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Hold the boat!" a voice rasps from the smoke-shrouded street. A man runs through the haze toward the wharf, clad in the armor of an Ironclad Regiment mercenary and gripping a horned helmet in his hand.

Characters recognize this man as [Jeyev Veldrews](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/jeyev-veldrews-dsotdq.md), Cudgel's lieutenant. He says he's been sent by Becklin to pass on the following information:

- The battle with the Red Dragon Army went poorly, but a few of the Ironclad Regiment escaped.  
- Becklin sent him to help everyone in the village safely evacuate and to ensure nobody waited for her and the mercenaries.  
- More Dragon Army forces are on his heels, and the villagers have to flee now.  

A character who looks at the helmet he carries recognizes it's the helmet of a Knight of Solamnia. Jeyev won't say more until they've boarded the ship. See the "Lost in Battle" section for more details.

#### Last Glimpse of Vogler

![Evacuees flee the Dragon Army's invasion of Vogler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/052-03-011.evacuees-flee.webp#center)

The characters escape Vogler on the last boat, a small fishing vessel barely large enough for the characters, Darrett, Mayor Raven, Jeyev, and a few other locals. Read or paraphrase the following as the characters leave Vogler behind:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Vogler is in flames. Amid the columns of smoke rising from the village, invaders loot what remains. The villagers traveling with you don't look away, watching until their home is nothing more than a red-black smear along the river's edge. The evacuation boats carry all that remains of Vogler down the Vingaard, toward an uncertain sanctuary in Kalaman.

#### Lost in Battle

It's up to you to determine how Becklin and Cudgel's battle against the Red Dragon Army unfolded and what Jeyev knows. In any case, Vogler's defenders were defeated and an enemy force marches on the town. The characters' allies might have suffered any of the following fates:

- **Assassination.** Jeyev is actually a neutral evil [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) who was bought off by the Dragon Army just like Gragonis was. He's been hired to assassinate the Solamnic knights in Vogler—Becklin and Darrett. He murdered Becklin during the battle and is now using her helmet to get close to Darrett.  
- **Capture.** Becklin sent Jeyev to warn the villagers that the defense failed and not to wait for their defenders. She sent her helmet as proof that Jeyev's words come from her. As Jeyev fled, he saw Becklin captured. You can determine where Becklin is being held, perhaps in one of the Dragon Army encampments detailed in chapters 4 or 5.  
- **Scattered.** Becklin and Cudgel orchestrated a retreat from the Dragon Army. Either of them might reappear in Kalaman in later chapters after evading their foes. As in the previous possibility, she sent Jeyev to warn the villagers.  
- **Witness.** If the characters already know about Becklin's defeat, Jeyev was separated from the rest of Vogler's defenders, knows specifics of her last battle, and recovered her helmet. He might still be an assassin or know the information in any of the other entries here.  

Regardless of your choice, Darrett takes Becklin's helmet and promises to keep it safe. If you choose to have Becklin return after the battle, she becomes a valued adviser to the military leaders of Kalaman (detailed in chapter 4).

### Next Steps

As the Vingaard River carries the flotilla of boats from Vogler toward Kalaman, a journey that takes most of the night, the characters advance to 4th level. After the horrors the villagers have faced, everyone is relieved their journey downriver is uneventful. Chapter 4 begins with the refugees' arrival outside Kalaman.
