# War Comes to Krynn
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 4* 

The world has ended, and it's ending again.

Three hundred years ago, the Cataclysm brought ruin to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of Krynn survived, but the world isn't what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their ancestors' wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world has changed.

Then came the Dragon Armies, legions of soldiers devoted to the wicked god Takhisis the Dragon Queen, and the world faces ruin once more. The War of the Lance has begun, and in a conflict between gods and dragons, a wounded world hangs in the balance.

## Using This Book

This book presents a glimpse of the world of Krynn through the lens of a specific conflict. Rather than providing an overview of the entire world, the book focuses on the region surrounding the city of Kalaman in the nation of Solamnia as the War of the Lance first reaches its borders. Details of the world and the perils facing Kalaman are presented through this introduction, supplemented by reports from Solamnic scholars and soldiers. Beyond this, the book is divided into the sections below.

Chapter 1 explores how to create characters prepared to take part in the War of the Lance. It details the peoples of Krynn, such as [kender](Mechanics/races/kender-dsotdq.md), along with feats, backgrounds, and a subclass to immerse characters in the world.

Chapter 2 provides an overview of this book's adventure and how to start playing. It also contains a series of short encounters to immerse characters in the world's mysteries.

Chapters 3 to 7 present an adventure detailing the Dragon Armies' invasion of Solamnia and their pursuit of a terrifying magical weapon.

Beyond these chapters, appendices support the adventure with equipment, magic items, stat blocks, and other resources. A poster map of the continent of Ansalon is included, depicting the regions mentioned throughout and those beyond.

## History of Krynn

![Scholars and soldiers acro...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/001-00-002.scholars.webp#center "Scholars and soldiers across Solamnia spread warnings of sinister forces rising beyond their nation's borders")

While every world's history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn's tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.

### Before the Cataclysm

Krynn's earliest centuries have passed into mythohistory. The story begins in the Age of Starbirth when the gods forged the world from primordial chaos. This period's records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.

Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these cultures often dismiss one another's foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the veracity of their own.

During a terrible conflict known as the Third Dragon War, the knight Huma Dragonbane was granted the first of the fabled [dragonlances](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md). He used it to defeat the evil god Takhisis the Dragon Queen and end the war, forcing the god and her dragons to leave Krynn. The good dragons of Krynn soon departed as well, leaving the world to mortals and the remaining gods.

![Takhisis the Dragon Queen in Her Human Guise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/002-00-002.takhisis.webp#center)

During the thousand years before the Cataclysm, known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.

Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions, peoples, and even thoughts the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats, culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted, united in their condemnation of Istar.

### The Cataclysm

As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest's ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.

A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.

The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.

### After the Cataclysm

The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might've kept Ansalon united, were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.

The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity's decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.

At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned. Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and diversified them.

As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even among Krynn's most dedicated scholars.

### The Dragon Queen's Return

Even as Ansalon healed, a new threat grew. The Dragon Queen Takhisis—known as Tiamat on other worlds—was banished from Krynn over a thousand years ago. Since then, she had waited patiently, plotting her return. Unbeknownst to the other gods, she planted a piece of the kingpriest's ruined temple at Neraka—hidden in the volcanic Taman Busuk region. There it grew into a baleful shadow of Istar's greatest edifice. Though this allowed the Dragon Queen to influence the world through a portal opened there, a fragment of the temple's foundation stone was missing, preventing her from fully returning to the world. She called on the evil dragons who served her, long withdrawn from the world, and began once more to plot the conquest of Krynn.

Chromatic dragons, acting on their god's orders, stole the eggs of good metallic dragons. The metallic dragons reluctantly pledged to not interfere in the coming war in exchange for the promised safety of their abducted broods.

But the Dragon Queen's servants secretly broke their promises. Takhisis taught her followers to corrupt the stolen eggs into monstrous warriors known as draconians, gambling that draconian armies will conquer Ansalon by the time the metallic dragons learn of this betrayal.

Unrivaled by gods or dragons, the Dragon Queen unleashes her forces upon a shattered world. In their god's name, these Dragon Armies begin their conquest of Krynn.

## The Dragon Armies

The Dragon Queen's forces are organized into five Dragon Armies. Draconians fill the ranks of each, though the armies' numbers also include humans, goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, and others who seek wealth and a return to pre-Cataclysm glories. Each Dragon Army is supported by chromatic dragons and their smaller kin, such as dragonnels and wyverns. These winged terrors provide a staggering advantage not seen on battlefields for over a thousand years.

The Dragon Queen has elevated her five most cunning and devout followers to the rank of dragon highlord, each commanding one of her armies. The highlords all report to Takhisis's champion, Duulket Ariakas, but there is no shortage of treachery between—and within—the Dragon Armies. The Dragon Queen encourages these conflicts, trusting them to bring the most ruthless and capable leaders to prominence.

The Red Dragon Army—the first, largest, and most powerful of Takhisis's forces—is commanded by the fanatical Dragon Highlord Verminaard, but he has temporarily given control of many of its troops to his acolyte, Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), tasking her with spearheading a daring attack on Solamnia. Meanwhile, Verminaard's force follows whispers from the Dragon Queen into the southern lands of Abanasinia.

The ambitious Highlord Kitiara Uth Matar commands the Blue Dragon Army. Second in power among the Dragon Queen's forces, the Blue Dragon Army prepares to join the Red Dragon Army's multipronged invasion of Solamnia. The Green Dragon Army recently came under the command of Salah-Khan, a Khur leader who united the region's nomads under Dragon Army rule. The half-ogre Lucien of Takar commands the Black Dragon Army, whose focused force supports the other armies and occupies the lands they conquer, including Nordmaar and Goodlund. Finally, the small White Dragon Army is led by Highlord Feal-Thas, a Silvanesti elf and black-robed member of the Mages of High Sorcery.

## The War of the Lance

As the Dragon Armies emerged from Neraka, they set into motion the events that will come to be known as the War of the Lance. Major events in the war are presented here. Each date occurs in the era after the Cataclysm (AC).

### Nordmaar Falls

*348 AC*

The first true military test of the Dragon Armies was the Red and Green Dragon Armies' successful invasion of the unprepared realm of Nordmaar. This victory convinced many neutral bands of hobgoblins and ogres in the Taman Busuk region to align with the Dragon Armies, though many holdouts remain.

### Khur Joins

*Early 349 AC*

The Green Dragon Army was dispatched to the steppes of Khur to subdue the tribes there. Rather than fight a protracted campaign, Ariakas allowed the cunning Khur leader Salah-Khan to defeat the Green Dragon Army's original highlord in battle, then offered to make Salah-Khan highlord in his place. In exchange for control over Khur and the surrounding lands, Salah-Khan accepted and pledged his people to Takhisis, adding to the Dragon Armies' ranks. Few can say whether he did so to further his own ambitions or to spare Khur a long, bloody conflict, but many Khur view Salah-Khan as a traitor to his people and fiercely resist the Green Dragon Army's occupation.

### Balifor and Goodlund Absorbed

*Mid 349 AC*

Without substantial military resistance, Balifor and the Goodlund Peninsula fell to the Black and White Dragon Armies. Though the land's residents are largely resigned to the Black Dragon Army's ongoing occupation, the kender of Kendermore lead the region's resistance, waging a guerrilla war against the occupiers.

### Silvanesti Campaign

*Late 349 AC through 350 AC*

The Red and Blue Dragon Armies attacked the elven nation of Silvanesti. The elves mounted a stiff resistance, and the siege stretched on in a brutal campaign.

After a year of fighting, the Silvanesti elves evacuated from their ancestral home and sailed for Southern Ergoth. The elves' leader, Speaker of the Stars Lorac, attempted to use an [orb of dragonkind](Mechanics/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md) to protect his homeland but succeeded only in transforming it into a land of nightmares, useless to both sides.

### Dragon Armies Regroup

*351 AC*

With virtually all of eastern Ansalon under their control, the Dragon Armies have spent much of the last year regrouping and consolidating their power. The Blue and Red Dragon Armies have returned to the Taman Busuk region, tasked with preparing to invade Solamnia. The White Dragon Army has ventured south to conquer Icereach, where its white dragons can fight effectively in its frozen lands. The Green and Black Dragon Armies focus on their occupied lands abroad.

In Neraka, zealots and black-robed mages devise magical plans to empower Dragon Army forces. One such plot, involving the ruins of an Istarian city, captures the imagination of Dragon Highlord Verminaard. He tasks his devotee, [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), with claiming a devastating new weapon for the Dragon Armies.

## Life on Ansalon

While Krynn holds many lands and cultures, the War of the Lance and adventures surrounding that conflict unfold on the continent of Ansalon. Here are a few details regarding everyday life there.

![Travelers approach the tow...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/005-00-005.gateway-splash.webp#center "Travelers approach the town of Gateway, a community sheltered amid the roots of a toppled Vallenwood tree")

### Languages

Across Ansalon, language is an expression of upbringing and exposure. Before the Cataclysm, Common served as a language of commerce under the empires of Ergoth, Solamnia, and Istar. After the Cataclysm, migrating refugees communicated using Common, and today it's spoken in every corner of the continent. Nevertheless, the local languages of most lands still flourish, and Common is used primarily in markets and in dealings with travelers.

With the DM's approval, players can exchange a language granted by their characters' race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Ansalon table or the Rare Languages of Ansalon table.

**Standard Languages of Ansalon**

| Language | Main Speakers | Script |

### Calendar

The lands around Kalaman use the Solamnic calendar, which has twelve months, each containing four weeks. Weeks have seven days, and days have twenty-four hours.

**Solamnic Months**

### Currency

Since the Cataclysm, the harsh realities of daily survival leave little room for impracticality. For years after the devastation, steel's value skyrocketed until it was valued as highly as gold, thanks to the difficulty of forging steel and its obvious practical applications. Similarly, bronze was valued on par with silver. While the value of steel and bronze has diminished to pre-Cataclysm standards, trade coins of bronze and steel remain in use across Ansalon.

**Currency of Ansalon**

| Coin | cp | bp/sp | gp/stl | pp |
|------|----|-------|--------|----|
| Copper (cp) | 1 | 1/10 | 1/100 | 1/1,000 |
| Bronze (bp) or Silver (sp) | 10 | 1 | 1/10 | 1/100 |
| Gold (gp) or Steel (stl) | 100 | 10 | 1 | 1/10 |

### Rumors of War

![Takhisis the Dragon Queen ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/006-00-006.tiamat-splash.webp#center "Takhisis the Dragon Queen turns her attention from eastern Ansalon toward the city of Kalaman")

Factual reports of war in eastern Ansalon and the Dragon Queen's return are slow to spread. Many of Ansalon's communities are isolated, and the Dragon Armies work to suppress information of their conquests. As a result, most people in Solamnia and west of the mountainous Taman Busuk region aren't aware of the Dragon Armies' threat beyond vague rumors.

Roll or choose a result from the Wartime Rumors table whenever characters hear a rumor regarding the Dragon Armies or strange happenings in eastern Ansalon. Each rumor notes how truthful it is, but even inaccurate rumors hold a grain of truth. At the start of the adventure, characters have each heard one of these rumors.

## Kalaman Region

Situated in the province of Nightlund in Solamnia's eastern reaches, Kalaman is one of the nation's most vital gateways to the outside world. The city, known as the Beacon of the East, rises along a deepwater port near the mouth of the Vingaard River, Solamnia's greatest trade artery. Blessed with the bounty of the river, the benefits of trade, and the fertile soil of the Solamnic plains, the Kalaman region flourished even after the Cataclysm.

### City of Kalaman

Kalaman began as a sleepy fishing village on the coast of the Turbidus Ocean. It might have remained so if not for the arrival of an Istarian trading mission centuries before the Cataclysm. Seeing the potential of a deep harbor so close to the mouth of a great river, the Empire of Istar invested heavily in the town, transforming it into a thriving trade hub. Solamnia soon found Istar's stranglehold on the booming port intolerable, and after a climactic battle on the plains west of the city, Istar ceded control of Kalaman.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/007-00-007.fallen-piece.webp#center)

Today, long after the fall of Istar and the trials of the Cataclysm, Kalaman remains a thriving port city surrounded by tall Istarian-built walls that have never been breached. In its busy harbor, vessels from all over Ansalon go about their business under the light of the city's two grand beacons, pre-Cataclysm marvels that have survived for generations. At the center of the city, the ancient Castle Kalaman rises intimidatingly on a sheer hill. The castle's architectural marvels include defenses yet to be recreated in the modern age. The city of Kalaman is further detailed in Chapter 4.

### People of Kalaman

The city of Kalaman is notably cosmopolitan, while most people in surrounding communities make their livelihood through fishing and farming. Many of the region's inhabitants are Solamnic humans, while others descend from the city's Istarian founders. Traders from all over Ansalon settle in Kalaman through preference or necessity. As a result, some humans hail or have ancestors from Abanasinia, Nordmaar, Ergoth, Estwilde, and farther-flung lands. Kender, hill dwarves, and gnomes are common in the region, while some elves, mountain dwarves, and other people also make their home in the city. Anyone is welcome in Kalaman if they come peaceably with goods to trade.

### Surrounding Regions

To the west of the Kalaman region lies Hinterlund. Even farther west lie the Plains of Solamnia, from where crops and crafted goods make their way to Kalaman for trade. Even in parts of Solamnia closer to the port of Palanthas, it's often cheaper and easier to move goods down the river to Kalaman.

North of Kalaman, the grasslands characteristic of Solamnia give way to the broken steppes and labyrinthine canyons known as the Northern Wastes. Deadly beasts, treacherous cliffs, and unpredictable flooding make the wastes a dangerous land where it's said nothing survives for long.

East of Kalaman, the lands of Estwilde hold inhospitable terrain and peoples who have been unfriendly to Solamnia since the days of Istar. Across the bay in northern Estwilde lie the swamps of Qwalmish. To the south and east of Kalaman are the rolling steppes of Qlettaar, which in turn give way to the forbidding peaks of the Taman Busuk region beyond Estwilde.

### Nightlund

For generations, the Soths of Dargaard Keep—a family of Knights of Solamnia—ruled the Solamnic province once known as Knightlund. Before the Cataclysm, the gods of good forewarned Knightlund's leader, Lord Loren Soth, about the coming destruction and offered him a chance to stop it, but he failed to accomplish this task. Since then, the province has had a cursed reputation. People have come to know the land as Nightlund and ascribe the region's frequent storms to the old gods' disfavor.

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and his defiance of the gods is detailed in chapter 4.

## Religion and the Gods

The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the world, and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles occur across the world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the old ways and employ mysterious magic. Long-lived peoples remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in nature and the constellations above. Ancient, forgotten sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine whispers reach those with the minds and hearts to listen. The gods haven't wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, mortals turn to them once more—sometimes after a remarkable encounter with a messenger of the gods.

The gods of Krynn loosely align with one another along the principles of good, neutrality, and evil. While such alliances can be tenuous, the gods often work together to enact their shared will across the world or to oppose unions of their foes. The Deities of Krynn table and the following sections summarize the gods most active in the world. Among Krynn's diverse lands and peoples, gods take various names, genders, and forms. Those presented in the following sections are the representations best known in Solamnia.

That even the gods of evil, selfish as they are, seek power and influence, not destruction for its own sake. Why, then, would they punish us with the Cataclysm and leave us in a godless world?

### Gods of Good

The gods of good provide healing and comfort to the mortals of Krynn. Although they oppose the evil gods' attempts to rule the world, their goal isn't the eradication of evil or its gods. Rather, their highest pursuit is preserving mortal choice, despite the sorrowful knowledge that mortals sometimes choose ruinous paths.

### Gods of Neutrality

The neutral gods of Krynn vary widely in their motivations and methods. Some are passive and distant, dedicated to recording the actions of mortals or upholding the balance between societies and nature. Others take a more active hand, injecting elements of chaos and innovation into mortal life. Unlike the gods of good and evil, the neutral gods have little interest in the struggle over mortal destinies.

### Gods of Evil

The evil gods of Krynn embody power, vengeance, and other ideals that elevate self above community. They wish to rule the mortal world, believing only they are worthy of such dominion. They rely on temptation and subjugation to secure the service of lesser creatures. In every age, some mortals are willing to sell their souls for power, and the gods of evil are eager to oblige.
