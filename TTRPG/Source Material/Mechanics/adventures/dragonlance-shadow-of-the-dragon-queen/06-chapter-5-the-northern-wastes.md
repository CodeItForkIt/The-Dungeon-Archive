# Chapter 5: The Northern Wastes
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 105* 

Buried beneath the magically scarred reaches of the Northern Wastes lies an ancient ruin now known as the City of Lost Names. In a bygone age, the city was named Onyari. Built by the Kingpriest of Istar, it soared through the heavens, but it was brought low by enraged dragons who discovered its grim secret: its flight relied on the innate magic of the draconic graveyard it was built on. Now, Onyari's ruins draw the attention of the Red Dragon Army, whose leaders believe they can raise the city into the heavens once more. The black-robed mage [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) and the priest [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) lead an expedition to claim the city as a massive weapon of war. The death knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) joins them, following whispers from the Dragon Queen to use the Cataclysmic fire from the depths of Castle Kalaman to raise the dead dragons buried in Onyari's foundations and bring them to her service.

![Soldiers from Kalaman stru...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/069-05-001.chapter-splash.webp#center "Soldiers from Kalaman struggle to survive amid the treacherous canyons of the Northern Wastes")

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins as the characters follow [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) into the Northern Wastes, accompanied by troops from Kalaman. Once there, the characters must explore several mystical sites to discover the location of the City of Lost Names.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, the characters advance from 6th to 8th level as they traverse the Northern Wastes. This chapter features multiple adventuring locations that can be explored in any order, so it's up to you to decide when the characters gain these levels. Consider using two of the following suggestions:

- The characters gain a level after completing three adventuring locations in the Northern Wastes.  
- The characters gain a level if they accomplish an extraordinary feat, such as rescuing the bronze dragon egg from Camp Carrionclay.  
- The characters gain a level once they find the passage leading into the City of Lost Names.  

## Desperation in Kalaman

Soon after the characters emerge from the catacombs beneath Castle Kalaman, [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) and Marshal Vendri return to Kalaman with their troops. As they learn about the attack on the city, Darrett urges the characters to rest. He sends scouts to learn where [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and his retinue went after fleeing the city. The following day, Darrett meets the characters with the following news:

- Marshal Vendri is working to maintain order in Kalaman until new civilian leaders are appointed.  
- She wants to speak with the characters soon.  
- Darrett's scouts have reported the Red Dragon Army has split its forces. A contingent is inexplicably heading into the Northern Wastes.  

Darrett doesn't know much beyond this at the moment. When the characters are ready, he leads them to meet with Marshal Vendri.

### Group Debriefing

The meeting with Marshal Vendri takes place in a small meeting room. Read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Marshal Vendri has claimed a modest meeting room down the hall from the council chamber marred by [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s attack. The room holds little more than a long table covered in reports, though tall windows offer a stunning view of the city and harbor beyond.
> 
> The marshal stands by a window, gazing toward the horizon. From a seat at the table, Lord Bakaris glances at you and then bitterly observes, "Here they are now, Marshal. Perhaps if we hadn't put our faith in sellswords, my son would be at my side and the governor would still be alive."
^233

Let the characters respond to Lord Bakaris if they please. Soon after, Vendri invites him to leave, and the noble grudgingly complies. Afterward, Vendri asks the characters to explain what happened the day before, including how the governor died. Guide the conversation using the following points:

- Vendri trusts the characters.  
- She says Lord Bakaris is spreading rumors that the characters could've saved Kalaman's leaders. Some locals are looking for someone to blame for the terrifying slaughter.  
- If characters mention [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s interest in the City of Lost Names in the Northern Wastes, the marshal knows nothing about the location and notes that the Northern Wastes is nothing but a deadly wasteland. If Soth is heading there, she believes he presents no further threat.  
- If characters present the broken [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md), neither Vendri nor Darrett is familiar with the weapon, and they see it only as an ancient relic.  
- Though Darrett doesn't understand [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s cryptic goals, he believes the characters' discoveries are important.  
- The marshal feels otherwise, believing Kalaman's military should focus on fighting nearby Dragon Army forces and restoring Kalaman's government.  

With Darrett's support, encourage the characters to make the case that [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) is a threat and the Dragon Army's plans in the north shouldn't be taken lightly. Vendri eventually relents.

Darrett then asks Vendri to let him take the characters and a contingent of troops into the Northern Wastes to investigate whatever the Dragon Army wants there. While Vendri isn't confident the move is strategically sound, she thinks it's a good idea for the characters to get out of Kalaman for a while to avoid the ire of its citizens. She asks the characters to leave while she and Darrett discuss details, suggesting they visit the castle's small library and learn what they can about the Northern Wastes.

### Learning about the Wastes

A character who spends at least one hour researching the Northern Wastes in Castle Kalaman's library learns that after the Cataclysm, the Northern Wastes became a barren, deadly region prone to flash floods. If a character succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check, they also learn that grand ruins predating the Cataclysm litter the region, though few explorers survive attempts to seek them.

### Darrett's Negotiations

Allow the characters to research the Northern Wastes or conduct any business in Kalaman. Afterward, Darrett seeks out the characters and relates the following information:

- Marshal Vendri has agreed to send Darrett and the characters to the Northern Wastes to investigate the Dragon Army's agenda there.  
- Darrett will be given command of a few hundred soldiers.  
- To avoid drawing the attention of the Dragon Army, Vendri has ordered a few ships to ferry Darrett's troops across Kalaman Bay at night.  
- A secluded cove called Wrecker's Edge lies at the southeastern shore of the wastes. This is where the forces will disembark.  
- From there, the characters and Darrett's troops are to discover the Dragon Army's plot, thwart it, and then return to the ships.  

Darrett answers any questions, then encourages the characters to prepare for the trip. He wants to depart the following night but is willing to delay a day.

### Message from Wyhan

If any of the characters are interested in joining the Mages of High Sorcery and delivered a scroll to [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md), the black-robed mage sends the characters an invitation to meet her at her apothecary.

When they arrive, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) shares the following information:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "My contacts at the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth have denied your request to travel there and participate in the Test of High Sorcery. The threat of the Dragon Army is too great, and the orders don't want to be perceived as taking sides in the conflict. However, the head of the conclave, the mage Par-Salian, has granted you a special exception."
> 
> [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) offers you a simple wooden brooch studded with black, red, and white stones: the symbol of the Mages of High Sorcery. "He has allowed you to practice magic as a provisional member of the Mages of High Sorcery. The time of your test will be decided after the Dragon Army's threat has passed. Until then, this token represents the conclave's blessing. Congratulations, provisional mage."
^237

[Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) doesn't know when the characters will be able to take the Test of High Sorcery. She knows the Mages of High Sorcery are wary of attracting the Dragon Army's ire, so the sooner the Dragon Army is defeated, the sooner the characters can progress with their magical studies.

After this, she urges the characters to either make a purchase or let her return to her research.

### Leaving Kalaman

Once the characters are ready to sail to the wastes, Darrett arranges to meet them that evening at a section of Kalaman's docks used by the military.

When the characters arrive, they find [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) and [Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md) have volunteered to join the journey. Rookledust—who has dyed her hair a vibrant violet hue—is excited at the opportunity to field-test her [fargabs](Mechanics/items/fargab-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A).

When the characters board one of the ships ferrying the troops, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Water sloshes and wood creaks as ships depart from Kalaman's docks in the dead of night. Citizens gathered to bid farewell to loved ones soon fade from view. The ships cuts through the dark waters of Kalaman Bay, sailing to perilous shores under cloudy skies.
^239

## Into the Wastes

The rest of this chapter takes place in the Northern Wastes, a region where the Cataclysm's destruction is still evident centuries later. This section contains general information about the region and the challenges the characters face as they traverse it. Map 5.1 depicts this region, sites that might be discovered by explorers, and various named environmental features. A version of this map appropriate to share with players appears in appendix E.

### Movement in the Wastes

Broken by canyons and sheer plateaus, the entirety of the Northern Wastes is considered "difficult terrain" for the purpose of travel. As a result, characters move at half speed through the wastes, as summarized in the Northern Wastes Land Travel table.

This means that if characters move at a normal pace, they can move 2 hexes on map 5.1 per day.

**Northern Wastes Land Travel**

| Pace | Distance per Hour | Distance per Day | Effect |
|------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Fast | 2 miles | 15 miles | −5 penalty to passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) scores |
| Normal | 1.5 miles | 12 miles | None |
| Slow | 1 mile | 9 miles | Able to use [Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth) |
^northern-wastes-land-travel

#### Movement with an Army

Darrett's troops have a challenging time navigating the Northern Wastes. They move at a slow pace, covering about nine miles a day. Darrett encourages the characters to move ahead of the troops and rendezvous with them at predetermined points. He relies on the characters to help him determine where to head next.

#### Running Travel in the Wastes

The Northern Wastes span hundreds of miles. Instead of roleplaying every minute of the party's travel, use the encounters from the "Wastes Encounters" section later in this chapter as often as you please—usually once per day. After the characters have spent several days in the wastes and learned about its dangers, consider making encounters less frequent.

The hexes on map 5.1 measure distance, but characters don't need to explore every hex. Feel free to skim over days of travel to reach new locations or return to already-visited ones. The Dragon Army also faces the challenges of the wasteland, so the characters don't need to rush to prevent their enemies from fulfilling their plots by a certain time.

### The Wash

Travelers in the Northern Wastes must contend with both the broken, canyon-riddled land and the Wash. Tides driven by Krynn's three moons cause floodwaters from the Turbidus Ocean to sweep through the region. These unpredictable flood tides are known as the Wash, and their harsh, salty water threatens creatures in the canyons. Sometimes the Wash leaves the Northern Wastes' canyons parched for weeks at a time; other times, the waters sweep in and out multiple times in a few days.

Each day the characters travel the Northern Wastes (or whenever you please), roll on the Nature of the Wash table to see how the floodwaters affect the region. At your discretion, the Wash might unexpectedly change during other encounters in the region, making them more dangerous.

**Nature of the Wash**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-the-northern-wastes.md#^nature-of-the-wash)`

| dice: d10 | Wash Effect |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1–3 | The Wash is low. Canyons are dry. |
| 4–6 | The Wash is high. It fills the canyons. |
| 7–10 | The Wash remains at the same level as the previous day. |
^nature-of-the-wash

#### Dangers of the Wash

When the Wash fills the Northern Wastes, the characters must make a DC 12 group Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. On a successful check, they notice signs of water beginning to fill the canyons, giving them time to reach safe ground. On a failed check, the characters are caught in a flash flood.

#### Flash Flood

During a flash flood, turbulent Wash waters flood the canyons in the area the characters are traveling through. If the characters are in a canyon, its walls are `2d4 × 10` feet high.

When the flood starts, have the characters and nearby creatures roll initiative. Each round, on initiative counts 10 and 0, the water level rises by 10 feet (up to the height of the canyon) and travels 100 feet horizontally. On each of these initiative counts, creatures in the water and moving along with it must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw as they're smashed by large chunks of debris. A creature takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The water level continues to rise and move this way for `2d4` rounds, then stops.

### Wastes Encounters

Countless threats loom in the wild, dangerous Northern Wastes. Whenever you want a random encounter to occur—usually once per day—roll on the Northern Wastes Encounters table.

**Northern Wastes Encounters**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-the-northern-wastes.md#^northern-wastes-encounters)`

| dice: d20 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–10 | No encounter |
| 11–14 | Dragon Army Patrols (see below) |
| 15 | Malfunctioning Gate (see below) |
| 16–20 | Wastes Predators (see below) |
^northern-wastes-encounters

#### Dragon Army Patrols

Hostile Dragon Army patrols scour the Northern Wastes for pre-Cataclysm ruins to exploit. Roll on the Dragon Army Patrol table to determine which patrol the characters encounter (see appendix B for the patrol members' stat blocks). If the characters are defeated or surrender, they're taken as prisoners to Camp Carrionclay (detailed later in this chapter).

**Dragon Army Patrol**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-the-northern-wastes.md#^dragon-army-patrol)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 8 [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) and 2 [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) |
| 2 | 1 [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and 5 [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) |
| 3 | 2 [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and 2 [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) |
| 4 | 3 [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) riding 3 [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) |
^dragon-army-patrol

#### Malfunctioning Gate

The characters find a stone archway lined with sigils. This gate used to be a teleportation gate—part of a magical transportation system created by Istarian mages. It once stood in Onyari before the city fell. As soon as a character approaches, magical energy swirls within the arch. The magic kicks up nearby debris that animates as a hostile [clay golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md).

![Few can survive the flood-...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/070-05-002.canyons-of-northern-wastes.webp#center "Few can survive the flood-prone canyons of the Northern Wastes")

##### Golem

The golem resembles a proud-looking human with fine robes and an aura of sunbeams around its head. The magic that animates the golem was designed to safeguard the gate, but it has malfunctioned. The golem goes berserk (as per its Berserk trait). The golem remains in that state as long as other creatures are visible.

##### Stabilizing the Gate

Magical energy flickers in the gate. After the golem is defeated, a character with the Pact Magic or Spellcasting feature can spend one minute investigating the gate to learn how to stabilize the gate's malfunctioning magic. If a character spends a spell slot of 1st level or higher or succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check, the gate stabilizes and serves as a permanent teleportation circle linked to its partner gate, which can be in any hex on map 5.1 you please—perhaps near Wrecker's Edge (location A) or High Hunt, the plateau that hosts Heart's Hollow (location G).

##### Sigil Sequence

Characters can learn the sigil sequence on the gate so they can teleport to it with the [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spell.

#### Wastes Predators

Roll on the table below to determine what predators the characters encounter. Each entry provides a different threat depending on whether the Wash is high or low (as noted in parentheses).

**Wastes Predators**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-the-northern-wastes.md#^wastes-predators)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | The bones of a Humanoid or Beast, infested with harmless spiders or tide-pool creatures (high or low) |
| 2–3 | 6 [giant octopuses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md) (high) or 3 [giant scorpions](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md) (low) |
| 4–5 | 4 [merrow](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) (high) or 6 [giant spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) (low) |
| 6–7 | 3 [plesiosauruses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/plesiosaurus.md) (high) or 3 [manticores](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) (low) |
| 8–9 | 2 [giant sharks](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-shark.md) (high) or 3 [wasteland dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (low; see appendix B) |
| 10 | 1 [purple worm](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) spotted a mile away (high or low) |
^wastes-predators

### Kalaman Troops

Traveling alongside Kalaman's troops presents challenges, but it is also safer and will eventually help the characters face the Dragon Army.

#### Army in Tow

During this part of the adventure, the characters are guiding Kalaman's troops toward battle with the Dragon Army. The characters should frequently split from the troops, then meet back up with them, serving as scouts and handling missions while the army advances. Darrett won't send his soldiers into uncertain danger, such as caves or ruins.

#### Combat Encounters

Avoid involving Kalaman's troops in encounters meant for the characters. If combat breaks out while the characters are with Kalaman's troops, use five [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B)—or however many you deem appropriate—to represent allied soldiers who are quick to aid the characters.

#### Kalaman Army Camp

As they travel the wastes, Darrett and his troops establish temporary camps. These camps offer characters a safe place to rest, replenish supplies, and interact with allies. A camp includes the following features, which you can arrange as you please:

- **Characters' Tents.** The characters can rest in their tents.  
- **Command Tent.** A large table is set up in this sizable tent. Here, the characters can meet with Darrett to discuss strategy and troop movement.  
- **Cudgel's Tent.** Cudgel's tent features an impressive weapons collection. If the characters need to talk to the dwarf, they likely find her here.  
- **Darrett's Tent.** Darrett's tent is spartan and well kept. If the characters ever need to talk to him in private, they're likely to find him here.  
- **Rookledust's Tent.** Rookledust's tent is filled with strange contraptions and unfinished projects. The gnome is often here, tinkering with the [fargabs](Mechanics/items/fargab-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A) and other inventions.  
- **Other Tents.** Guard posts, hospital tents, supply tents, and other accommodations fill out the camp.  

## Exploring the Wastes

As the characters venture into the Northern Wastes, they might want to explore the following areas.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.1: Kalaman and Northern Wastes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/071-map-5.01-kalaman-and-northern-wastes.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/072-map-5.01-kalaman-and-northern-wastes-player.webp#gallery)

### A: Wrecker's Edge

After crossing Kalaman Bay, the ships carrying the characters and their allies arrive near Wrecker's Edge (location A on map 5.1). As the ships drop anchor near a rocky coast, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Waves crash against jagged rocks along the shore. Beyond, red-hued canyons carve their way through a harsh landscape. In the distance, mountainous crags and strange formations jut skyward.
^24e

Darrett asks the characters to take a rowboat and find a place where the troops can disembark safely.

#### Hidden Cove

After about an hour of exploring the shore, the characters spot a narrow cove. This time is halved if a character is proficient with water vehicles or is a ranger whose favored terrain is the coast.

A few rotten wooden buildings abandoned by smugglers line this cove. Additionally, a small ship is anchored near a clear beach inside the cove.

#### Elven Ship

The ship belongs to a group of elven wizards who found Wrecker's Edge a few months ago. Characters who grew up in an elven society or who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check identify the ship as being of Silvanesti elven origin.

The ship is small but seaworthy, with enough room for a dozen crew members. It has nothing of value on its deck or in the communal bunks below deck. However, two [air elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) on the deck defend the vessel against intruders. They attack any non-elf that sets foot upon the ship.

If the characters haven't met [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) yet (see the following section), he's nearby when they board the ship, and an [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md) spell cast on the deck alerts him to their intrusion. He might approach them anytime after they defeat the elementals (see the following section).

#### Meeting Dalamar

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) approaches the characters soon after they defeat the elementals or Kalaman's troops start disembarking. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is curious about the adventurers' motives and whether they align with his. Speaking with him reveals the following information:

- [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is part of a contingent of Silvanesti elves.  
- The ship is the elves' conveyance.  
- [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is surveying the coast for ancient ruins. He knowns there are none here, but his leader, Zhelsuel, wants him to search thoroughly anyway.  
- If the characters mention the City of Lost Names, he pretends not to recognize the name until he knows more about the characters (see the "Mutual Understanding" section). A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check believes [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) knows more than he says.  
- [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) invites the characters to return with him to his group at the elven encampment (location B on map 5.1).  

#### Dalamar

![Dalamar provides a glimpse of lost, ancient ruins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/073-05-003.dalamar.webp#center)

An ambitious elf magic-user, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) (neutral elf [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) has an insatiable thirst for knowledge. This often puts him at odds with other Silvanesti mages, whose conservative methods wear on his patience.

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) participated in the ill-fated defense of Silvanesti against the Dragon Armies. His desperate actions were part of the reason he and the other mages were sent to the Northern Wastes. Despite resenting his people's small-minded decisions, he sees this mission as a chance to prove himself and potentially strike back against the Dragon Armies. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) studied pre-Cataclysm magic long before being sent here, and he believes something of magical value might be hidden in the region. He wants to find it swiftly, return to his people, and continue working toward joining the Mages of High Sorcery.

##### Personality Trait

"Everybody wants something. I'm certain we can help one another."

##### Ideal

"Magic is meant to be used."

##### Bond

"I'll do anything to recover my home."

##### Flaw

"I'm overconfident, sometimes to the point of putting myself or others in danger."

#### Reporting Back

If the characters return to their ships and give Darrett directions to Wrecker's Edge, he orders the ships to shore. He's curious about [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) and the elves. He suggests the characters investigate the elven encampment and determine whether they can be trusted.

While the characters are away, Kalaman's troops unload the ships and set up their first camp as detailed in the "Kalaman's Army Camp" section earlier in this chapter.

### B: Elven Encampment

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) leads the characters to his expedition's encampment about twelve miles northwest of the hidden cove. The journey takes the better part of the day, during which [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) charmingly banters with the characters, trying to learn more about why they're in the region. He offers little in return but is eager to hear about recent events in Kalaman.

#### Expedition Members

The elven camp lies next to some small ruins on a plateau overlooking the wastes, with a dozen or so tents arranged in a spiral pattern. Ten elves are present in the camp when the characters arrive, including their leader, Zhelsuel. Others roam the wastes in search of information. They all use the [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) stat block.

#### Silvanesti's Exiles

Once a beautiful woodland nation with sculpted trees and towering spires, the elven land of Silvanesti lies in ruins after being invaded by the Dragon Armies. The elves struggled to defend their homeland and were ultimately forced to retreat to the island of Southern Ergoth to seek a new home.

The elves here in the Northern Wastes were among the defenders of Silvanesti. When they failed to protect their homeland, they were sent on an expedition to the wastes following centuries-old legends of Silvanesti magic lost in the region. They hope recovering such magic might help them save their homeland and redeem themselves in the eyes of their people.

#### Zhelsuel

Zhelsuel, a once-respected member of House Mystic—an elven clan known for magical prowess—is reaching a venerable age even by elven standards. He's keenly aware this expedition is a fool's errand analogous to exile, and he believes his homeland is lost to him forever. But if he must spend the rest of his days in this bleak expanse, he's determined to spend them as an exemplar of thoroughness and scholarship. He drives his subordinates to catalog every foot of the Northern Wastes in search of the barest scrap of Silvanesti magic.

##### Personality Trait

"I know what's best for my people, and I lead with logic and precision."

##### Ideal

"I take pride in work done to perfection."

##### Bond

"I'll show my people what I can do. My name won't be forgotten."

##### Flaw

"I won't accept any course of action that doesn't put the best interest of Silvanesti first."

#### Meeting Zhelsuel

Zhelsuel confronts [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) and the characters when they arrive. He wants nothing to do with outsiders and sees them as an obstacle to the elves' progress. He tells the characters he and the rest of the elves are conducting research, but he refuses to elaborate.

A character who speaks to Zhelsuel in Elvish or succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces him to converse, though most of Zhelsuel's responses are cutting and brief:

- Zhelsuel shares any of the information from the "Silvanesti's Exiles" or "Zhelsuel" sections.  
- If characters bring up the Red Dragon Army's attack on Kalaman, it clearly gives him pause, but he quickly dismisses the conflict as irrelevant to his people.  
- If the characters mention they're in pursuit of the Dragon Army, Zhelsuel scoffs at their eagerness to rush to their deaths.  

Zhelsuel ultimately demands the characters leave and not return. He commands the expedition, specifically [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md), to focus on their survey of the region. He then tells [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) to escort the characters away and return to his work.

#### Mutual Understanding

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is frustrated that Zhelsuel seems content to spend the rest of his days—and those of the other expedition members—turning over rocks in the Northern Wastes. After being told to see the characters away, he shares that the elves recently spotted Dragon Army soldiers headed north. He doesn't know their destination, but he suspects they're not just wandering. He suggests that perhaps the Dragon Army, the elves, and the characters have similar interests in this land's hidden magic.

#### Finding the City of Lost Names

If the characters asked [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) about the City of Lost Names, he tells them he learned of the city from the Silvanesti writings that led him and the other elves to this region. Though he doesn't know its location, he's interested in finding it, as it reportedly was a magical marvel that might hold valuable secrets.

Once [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) reveals this shared interest in the City of Lost Names, he proposes an arrangement that would allow him to advance his research without technically disobeying Zhelsuel. He points the characters to sites in the Northern Wastes he has already identified as being related to or of a similar age to the City of Lost Names. With the characters' insights and reports about whatever magic remains at those sites, he should be able to glean more information about the city's location. The following locations (detailed later in this chapter and shown on map 5.1) are of particular interest to [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md):

- Blue Phoenix Shrine (location C)  
- Sunward Fortress (location D)  
- Wakenreth (location E)  

Mark these sites' hexes on the players' map of the region in appendix E after [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) notes their locations.

If the characters agree to work with [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md), he's pleased. They can explore the locations in any order they wish. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) plans to convince Zhelsuel to let him meet the characters at Wakenreth. Once they've relayed their findings to him, he hopes he'll be able to determine the location of the City of Lost Names (see the end of the "E: Wakenreth" section for details). With this, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) sends the characters on their way, wishing them fruitful investigations.

### C: Blue Phoenix Shrine

Carved into a labyrinthine gorge is the Blue Phoenix Shrine, an ancient shrine to Habbakuk—god of the seas and animal life. The entrance to the shrine is completely engulfed by water when the Wash is high, but it is visible during low tide.

#### Disrupted Pilgrimage

Every year, a group of Dimernesti sea elves from Thoradin Bay travels to the Blue Phoenix Shrine to honor the Sea Lord for his bounty. While most sea elves have forgotten the name Habbakuk, they faithfully continue this annual pilgrimage.

Though the Wash changes chaotically, the sea elves swim to the shrine following reliable rivers that flow through ravines. This year, however, the pilgrimage went awry when the sea elves crossed paths with the Red Dragon Army. Four sea elves were captured—including their leader, the priest Yearkal—and many others perished in the confrontation (the characters can rescue three of the captured sea elves at Camp Carrionclay, while Yearkal was taken to the Sunward Fortress). Six survivors reached the shrine, but they managed to hold on to only one offering: a pouch of blue deep-sea pearls.

#### Approaching the Shrine

When the characters arrive, the Wash is low. The sea elves have set up camp near the shrine's entrance. They periodically leave to scout for signs of the Dragon Army or missing comrades.

#### The Sea Elves

After their recent ordeal, the sea elves are on alert for large groups of people. If the characters approach them with Kalaman's troops in tow, the sea elves retreat. Their current leader, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) Stargazer, approaches only if it's clear no one's pursuing them with hostile intent.

[Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) and the [sea elves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/sea-elf-scout-dsotdq.md) use the [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) stat block with the following changes:

- They have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put them to sleep.  
- They have [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to 60 feet.  
- They have a swimming speed of 30 feet and can breathe air and water.  

#### Ishvern Stargazer

![Ishvern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/074-05-004.ishvern.webp#center)

[Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) (neutral good, [sea elf scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/sea-elf-scout-dsotdq.md)), the de facto leader of the Dimernesti group in their priest's absence, is pious, curious, and insightful. Having survived in the deadliest depths of the Turbidus Ocean for over a century, he knows better than to venture into mysterious places unprepared. He isn't eager to risk his companions' lives without the priest Yearkal's guidance. However, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) fears Yearkal might be lost forever. If others might aid him in fulfilling her spiritual mission, he's eager for their help.

##### Personality Trait

"Embrace the world's wonders, but be wary of its dangers."

##### Ideal

"Life and nature are marvels that must be protected at all costs."

##### Bond

"I will find my missing companions."

##### Flaw

"I can be indecisive when choosing between options with uncertain outcomes."

#### Ishvern's Plea

[Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) tries to get a sense of the characters' motivations for traveling the Northern Wastes. He explains the nearby shrine is a sacred place, dedicated to an old deity the sea elves now remember only as the Sea Lord. If the characters approached the camp respectfully, he also tells them how the sea elves were attacked by the Dragon Army.

Even if he is suspicious of the characters, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) sees value in their presence—especially if there's a cleric among them. He requests the characters help him make the group's offering in the name of their lost priest, Yearkal. The elves seek to make this offering in keeping with their peoples' centuries-old traditions, but they know little of the deed's religious ties or the god Habbakuk. If the characters agree, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) leads them to the shrine's entrance.

##### Yearkal's Return

If the characters know of Yearkal's fate or return her to the group (see the "D: Sunward Fortress" section), the elves encourage the characters to come with them into the shrine. If Yearkal is with them, she knows all the threats and secret passages in areas C1 through C4.

#### Shrine Features

The shrine has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in the shrine are 15 feet high.  
- **Light.** All areas of the shrine are brightly lit by blue [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on seashells and other objects embedded in the walls.  
- **Walls and Doors.** The shrine's walls and doors are made of solid stone. Except for the door in area C1, the doors throughout the shrine open easily.  
- **Water.** The Wash is low when the characters reach the shrine, but each room is filled with 2 feet of standing water, except for area C5. Areas with standing water are "difficult terrain".  

#### Shrine Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.2: Blue Phoenix Shrine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/075-map-5.02-blue-phoenix-shrine.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/076-map-5.02-blue-phoenix-shrine-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1: Shrine Entrance

The shrine's entrance is carved in the escarpment of the ravine. Once the characters reach the entrance, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An ancient, algae-covered double door made of white granite stands here. It is etched with an eroded image of a majestic bird with outstretched wings.
^271

A follower of Habbakuk or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the bird on the door as a blue phoenix, the symbol of the god Habbakuk, god of the seas and animal life.

##### Shrine Door

[Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) explains Yearkal opened this door by saying a specific prayer, but he doesn't know it. If a character says the name "Habbakuk" within 10 feet of the door, it swings open magically. Casting the [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell also opens the door.

The door is a Large object with AC 17, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### C2: Altar Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long room stretches ahead, its walls carved with motifs of rolling waves. A ceiling supported by twin pillars glows with faint blue light.
> 
> At the rear of the chamber stands an altar carved with coral-like designs. Behind it rises a sizable granite sculpture depicting the bird from the shrine's entrance, its outstretched wings wreathed in flames.
> 
> An archway opens into a chamber to the west, while a simple stone door stands in the wall to the east.
^274

Upon entering this chamber, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) directs the characters to the west archway leading to area C3. He encourages them to cleanse themselves with the water there before proceeding deeper into the shrine.

##### Altar Guardians

If a character comes within 10 feet of the altar without having washed themself in area C3 within the last 24 hours, three [water weirds](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) rise from the water between the pillars. They are hostile toward any Humanoid who doesn't openly bear the symbol of Habbakuk. The water weirds cease attacking and vanish if a creature in the room uses an action to apologize to Habbakuk or speak a prayer to the god's name.

#### C3: Cleansing Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the center of this room rests a three-foot-high brass basin filled with clear water. A relief ornaments the walls, depicting great sea birds dipping into the waves alongside leaping fish and whimsical creatures.
^277

On entering this room, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) reminds the characters to cleanse themselves with the pool's water before proceeding deeper into the holy place. He then spends a minute washing his own face and hands.

Characters who follow suit feel refreshed. The first time a creature washes itself with water from the basin, it gains 5 "temporary hit points".

#### C4: Hall

This passage is empty, but its north door bears an inscription in Elvish: "Honor those who came before, and walk on." [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) can translate this text if needed.

#### C5: Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Alcoves to the west and east of this chamber hold waist-high stone sarcophagi sculpted with images of shells and graceful sea creatures.
^27a

This crypt is the resting place of followers of Habbakuk who tended to this shrine.

##### Tombs

The sarcophagus to the west bears an inscription in Elvish: "Herzon, who built this prayer in stone." A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher notices a design on its lid resembling the layout of the shrine. Although the crypt has no other visible exits, the room on the map corresponding to the crypt features a second passage leading to the southwest.

The sarcophagus to the east bears a different inscription in Elvish: "Awinthel, our devoted first priest."

A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Strength check can open either sarcophagus—though [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) strongly objects. The corpse within each sarcophagus is immaculately preserved, but the burial places contain nothing of value.

##### Secret Door

This crypt is seemingly a dead end. A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 20 or higher notices the secret door if they come within 5 feet of it. The [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell also reveals the secret door.

The secret door magically opens if a character obeys the inscription on door in area C4 and prays or makes an offering at either sarcophagus. Casting the [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) or [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell also makes it easy to push the door open. The door is a Large object with AC 17, 40 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

#### C6: Offering Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Steps ascend into a room covered in thick, black algae. At the center of the room stands a well, from which emanates the sound of distant waves and the cries of sea birds.
^27e

Here, initiates of Habbakuk once made offerings to honor their god.

##### Shrine Guardians

If a character who didn't wash in area C3 or who opened a sarcophagus in area C4 comes within 10 feet of the well, the algae on the walls coalesces into three [black puddings](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) that immediately attack the offending character as well as other creatures that attack the puddings.

##### Ishvern's Offering

So long as there are no obvious threats in this room, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) moves to the side of the well, softly speaks a brief prayer in Elvish, then empties several dozen blue pearls from a pouch into the well (he retains 750 gp worth of pearls just in case). After he does so, each character in the room who washed themself in area C3 and who didn't disturb the sarcophagi in area C5 gains the charm [Habbakuk's Blessing](Mechanics/rewards/habbakuks-blessing-dsotdq.md) (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"; see below). With this done, [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) thanks the characters for helping him complete his party's task and prepares to depart.

#### Leaving the Shrine

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) needs to know only that the Blue Phoenix Shrine is a holy place sacred to the god Habbakuk.

As the group leaves the shrine, if the characters haven't already rescued the sea elves at Camp Carrionclay, a [sea elf scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/sea-elf-scout-dsotdq.md) approaches [Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) to tell him they've found where their captured companions were taken. The sea elves have been imprisoned at a Dragon Army camp in the middle of a murky lake (see the "I: Camp Carrionclay" section). These sea elf scouts provide directions to area I on map 5.1. Mark this hex on the players' map of the region in appendix E.

[Ishvern](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ishvern-dsotdq.md) asks the characters to find and free these captives. In return, he offers them what remaining treasure he has: a few blue pearls worth 750 gp.

### D: Sunward Fortress

The Red Dragon Army has unearthed the centuries-old Sunward Fortress, a pre-Cataclysm monument to the god Sirrion. While most of its ruins have sunk beneath the ground, a crumbling, lighthouse-like spire pierces the surface and marks the location of the ruins below.

#### Shard of Chaos

When Dragon Army scouts discovered the ruins of the Sunward Fortress, the black-robed wizard [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) ordered an outpost established there. A servant of the Dragon Queen and a fervent antiquarian, [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) sought to discover the forgotten ruin's secrets. Dragon Army soldiers and captives worked tirelessly until they unearthed a mysterious stone in the ruins' depths. Soon after, workers at the site began transforming into scaled monstrosities. Unbeknown to everyone, the shard was imbued with the power of the Spawning Stone—the source of the vicious monsters called slaadi.

The Dragon Army evacuated the ruin, but not completely. The evil cleric [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md)'s peer, was fascinated with the phenomenon. He ordered a bozak draconian named [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) to stay behind and claim the Spawning Shard's magic in the Dragon Queen's name.

#### Approaching the Fortress

Read the following when the characters approach the Sunward Fortress:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Amid the natural stone formations of the Northern Wastes, a broken, hundred-foot spire lies half buried. The massive spire's base and toppled pinnacle would be easy to miss were it not for the excavation sites and abandoned tents surrounding them.
^286

The Sunward Fortress was once a hermitage for those seeking to commune with Sirrion's greatest flame: the sun. The structure was akin to a great lighthouse, the upper reaches of which burned in the god's honor. It toppled down during the Cataclysm and has been abandoned ever since.

#### Toppled Ruins

The Sunward Fortress's pinnacle remains unexcavated, but characters who investigate it find only several crumbled, half-buried floors. A character who examines these ruins and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check can tell this was a holy site whose upper levels were constructed to burn like a massive beacon.

#### Dragon Army Excavation

At the base of the spire's remains stand a dozen ragged canvas tents in the red and black colors of the Red Dragon Army. Dozens of empty or shattered crates are scattered amid the camp. Nearby, an earthen ramp cuts through the clay and leads to an opening into the ruined spire's foundation. This opening leads to area `D1`.

##### Abandoned Gear

Characters who spend 10 minutes investigating the tents find enough dried meat to sustain one person for ten days, twelve dirty [shovels](Mechanics/items/shovel.md), an overturned wheelbarrow, and a suit of [leather armor](Mechanics/items/leather-armor.md) bearing the Dragon Queen's symbol.

##### Mysterious Markings

A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) score of 16 or higher notices two types of clawed footprints amid the camp. Some are roughly human-sized, while others are twice that size. Characters who have seen draconian footprints before recognize the smaller prints as draconian. The characters likely have no way of knowing the larger prints are slaadi tracks.

##### Resting near Camp

If the characters take a long rest in the camp or within a mile of the Sunward Fortress, there is a 50 percent chance they are attacked by two [red slaadi](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md) that fight to the death.

#### Sunward Fortress Features

The ruin has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in the ruins are 10 feet high.  
- **Light.** The ruins are not illuminated. The current occupants rely on [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Tracks.** The floors throughout the ruin are covered in clear footprints of booted Dragon Army soldiers, captives wearing foot-wrappings, draconian claws, and slaadi claws. They go in every direction and don't suggest individual paths.  

#### Sunward Fortress Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.3: Sunward Fortress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/077-map-5.03-sunward-fortress.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/078-map-5.03-sunward-fortress-player.webp#gallery)

#### D1: Entry Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ramp of packed clay descends from the surface through a gap in the ancient stone wall. It emerges into a chamber thick with dust and old air. Atop a low dais to the north stands an altar carved with candle sconces, a shallow basin, and stylized flames. To the south, a spiral stairwell winds downward. To the east, an archway leads to another chamber.
^28f

This room once served as a place of worship for the hermits who occupied the spire.

##### Altar

A cleric of Sirrion or a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the symbols on the altar as holy to Sirrion, god of creativity and change. A character who speaks an earnest prayer to Sirrion causes flames to spring to life within the altar's candle sconces and a thick, red liquid to fill its basin. This liquid is a [potion of fire breath](Mechanics/items/potion-of-fire-breath.md). After creating this potion, the altar won't do so again until one month has passed.

##### Stairs

The stairs here descend to area `D3`.

#### D2: Abandoned Dormitories

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Battered bed frames and straw mattresses clutter this room, interspersed with fragments of ragged clothing.
^293

The Dragon Army's prisoners rested here before slaadi destroyed the room. A character who spends five minutes searching the debris finds bits of clothing, two sets of [manacles](Mechanics/items/manacles.md), and a blue pearl worth 150 gp.

#### D3: Lower Chambers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stairs descend into an space surrounded by a series of halls and cramped rooms. A thick, rotten smell permeates the air. Digging equipment and crates have been crammed into every corner and alcove.
^295

This floor once served as lodging for the fortress's residents. Characters who enter the east hall see the barricaded door leading to area `D4`.

##### Equipment

The crates hold dozens of tools. A character who spends ten minutes searching the equipment finds three [bullseye lanterns](Mechanics/items/bullseye-lantern.md), six [flasks of oil](Mechanics/items/oil-flask.md), 100 feet of [hempen rope](Mechanics/items/hempen-rope-50-feet.md), four [vials of acid](Mechanics/items/acid-vial.md), and three sets of [mason's tools](Mechanics/items/masons-tools.md).

##### Dracophage Subjects

Four mutated [draconian-slaad hybrids](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/dracophage-subject-dsotdq.md) lurk in the east hall. They look like bloated draconians with bright-red skin and wide, frog-like mouths. These creatures use the [kapak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) stat block (see appendix B), but replace their Dagger attack with the following attack:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) poison damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease—a minuscule slaad egg.
> 
> A Humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a [slaad tadpole](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole.md). In the 24-hour period before the tadpole is born, the host feels unwell; its speed is halved; and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.
> 
> If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the tadpole disintegrates.
^298

##### Stairs

In the northwest corner of the level, stairs descend to area `D5`.

#### D4: Barricaded Room

The entrance to this room is barricaded by heavy mining equipment. Inside are two Dragon Army captives who escaped the initial slaadi attack and [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) (see area `D5` for details). A character can unblock the door by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so alerts the [hybrid draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/dracophage-subject-dsotdq.md) in area `D3`. If the characters try to speak through the crates, Yearkal answers them in a whisper, urging them to keep quiet.

##### Survivors

The Dimernesti sea elf Yearkal (neutral good, sea elf [acolyte](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md); see the "C: Blue Phoenix Shrine" section for details on sea elves) hides inside the room with the [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) Rone (neutral, human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)), a hunter from Heart's Hollow. Rone has been infected with an ailment Yearkal doesn't know how to treat (see "Rone's Fate" below).

Yearkal is scared but unharmed. Once she confirms the characters aren't monsters, she removes the barricade and shares the following facts:

- When Yearkal was captured and brought here, the Dragon Army made her join the workers unearthing this ruin. The camp's commander had orders to recover whatever relics or magic lie within.  
- They eventually dug up a large, glowing stone. Soon after, violent, toad-like terrors emerged.  
- Yearkal and Rone fled but were recaptured by [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md), a magic-using draconian.  
- [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) seeks to use the magic of the stone to transform people into draconians. However, his actions caused more monsters to emerge.  
- Since then, Yearkal and Rone have been hiding here. Rone has felt unusual for the last few days, but he's grown increasingly ill in the last day.  
- Yearkal knows there are other sea elves at the Blue Phoenix Shrine and Camp Carrionclay. She wishes to reunite with all of them.  

##### Rone's Fate

Rone is infected with a slaad tadpole. Due to [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md)'s experiments, the tadpole matured rapidly and is about to hatch. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check realizes Rone is infected by a dangerous parasite that will soon kill him, though a [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic could heal him.

If the characters don't heal Rone, a [slaad tadpole](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole.md) emerges 1 hour after the characters encounter him, killing him. If the characters do heal Rone, he thanks them and offers them a 1,000 gp reward if they take him home to Heart's Hollow.

#### D5: Spire Depths

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This level of the fortress hasn't been fully excavated. A thirty-foot-wide chasm splits it in two, spanned by makeshift wooden footbridges. On the far side of the chasm, digging implements surround an eight-foot-tall crystal glowing with a noxious orange light. On the near side of the chasm, a hulking red form covered in squirming shapes digs through broken crates.
^29f

The creature is a [red slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md) covered in five [slaad tadpoles](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole.md). These monsters attack as soon as they spot the characters. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the monsters as slaadi, denizens of the plane of Limbo.

![A red slaad covered in slaad tadpoles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/079-05-005.red-slaad-covered-tadpoles.webp#center)

Hidden in the shadows south of the chasm is the mutated draconian [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) (see below). He doesn't attack until someone tries to cross the chasm.

##### Chasm and Bridges

The chasm drops 70 feet to an uneven stone floor below. A creature that falls into the chasm takes 24 (`7d6`) bludgeoning damage.

The bridges crossing the chasm look treacherous but are stable. If [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) hits a creature on a bridge with his Hurl Flame attack, the bridge begins to smolder, igniting at the beginning of his next turn. After a bridge ignites, a creature that enters the bridge for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage. A bridge falls into the chasm 3 rounds after it ignites.

##### Virruza

Changed by days of strange experiments involving draconian blood and exposure to the Spawning Shard, [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) now looks like a tumescent draconian with warty green skin and an overly large mouth. Use the [green slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/green-slaad.md) stat block for [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md), but replace the Shapechanger trait with the following trait:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Death Throes.** When [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, he turns into a puddle of acid and splashes acid on those around him. Each creature within 5 feet of him must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 7 (`2d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.
^2a2

[Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) is hostile, is unable to communicate intelligibly, and fights to the death.

##### Spawning Shard

This enormous orange gem weighs over a ton and sheds dim light for 10 feet. A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals it emanates an aura of transmutation magic. A character who inspects the Spawning Shard and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines the gem's magic can corrupt creatures and turn them into slaadi.

A creature that touches the gem must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (`3d6`) every 24 hours unless the target is cured by magic such as the [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a [red slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md) or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a [green slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/green-slaad.md). Only a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell can reverse the transformation.

##### Treasure

[Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) carries a pouch containing 900 gp worth of nonmagical orange gemstones—they aren't related to the Spawning Shard, though they look similar. He also carries a [+1 wand of the war mage](Mechanics/items/1-wand-of-the-war-mage.md) he has forgotten how to use.

Characters who search the south side of the chamber find [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md)'s personal notes on scattered pieces of parchment. A character who spends ten minutes reading them learns the following details:

- [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) was following orders from a Dragon Army commander named [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md).  
- His mission was to investigate the monster-creating stone unearthed here.  
- He was optimistic he could use the stone's magic to create a disease to turn people into draconians.  
- [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md) notes that exposure to what he calls the "Spawning Shard" has begun to change him.  
- After this, the notes grow sloppy and nonsensical.  

#### Leaving the Fortress

Once the characters have investigated area `D5`—and potentially claimed [Virruza](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/virruza-dsotdq.md)'s notes—they have all the information about this site [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) requires.

If the characters want to seal the entrance to the Sunward Fortress or otherwise bury the Spawning Shard, the equipment left around the ruins allows them to collapse the ramp leading to area `D1` with four hours of effort. Destructive magic hastens this work.

### E: Wakenreth

The funerary obelisk of Wakenreth—"House of Silence" in Elvish—was constructed by Silvanesti elves in the Istarian city of Onyari shortly before the city took flight. The tower served as an emblem of peace between the people of Istar and Silvanesti. However, as with all of Onyari, Wakenreth met a tragic end, and it's now haunted by the spirits it used to keep safe. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is unaware Wakenreth was once part of the City of Lost Names—he knows only that Silvanesti writings speak of a magical tower rising from the wasteland.

#### The Doomed Mausoleum

In addition to being a symbol of peace between Silvanesti and Istar, the tower of Wakenreth served as a crypt for the elves who lived in Onyari—though it saw little use before the city's destruction. When Onyari began its slow fall across the skies of the Northern Wastes, the monolith broke from its foundations, toppling toward the ground far from where the rest of the city eventually crashed. As the structure fell, Wakenreth's caretaker desperately invoked the tower's magic in hopes of transporting it to the Feywild. However, the magic of the displaced tower went awry and partially transported the tower to the Shadowfell. Though this helped Wakenreth survive, the portal within the tower has corrupted the spirits of those who rested within and trapped the site in a state of perpetual dissolution.

#### Approaching Wakenreth

As the characters near the ruined tower, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead, a pale stone tower juts from the rust-colored landscape. Carved with the likenesses of a thousand elven warriors, the tower has relatively intact lower levels, but as it climbs toward its eighty-foot height, the upper levels deteriorate. Rather than falling, the crumbling stone hangs in the air, the tower's disintegration frozen unnaturally. A rusty iron double door at the tower's base hangs ajar.
^2aa

Exposure to Shadowfell magic has caused the upper levels of Wakenreth to deteriorate. Caught between that plane and the Material Plane, the ruin is locked in a perpetual state of frozen dissolution. Although the upper levels are crumbling, the shattered stone walls are still bound tightly enough to prevent creatures from slipping inside.

The ancient door here opens into area E1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.4: Wakenreth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/080-map-5.04-wakenreth.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/081-map-5.04-wakenreth-player.webp#gallery)

#### Wakenreth Features

The mystical tower has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Wakenreth's ceilings are 20 feet high.  
- **Doors.** All doors are made of rusty iron. They are unlocked and open easily, though noisily.  
- **Lighting.** Areas E1 and E2 are brightly lit by [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on wall sconces. In areas E3 and E4, these glowing sconces are affected by Shadowfell magic that causes them to produce only dim light and shine with an eerie green glow. Area E5 is dimly lit by a gloomy gray sky.  

#### Wakenreth Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.4, except for area E5, which is unmapped.

#### E1: First Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This round chamber is illuminated by white flames flickering in magical sconces on the walls. In the room's center stands a gleaming obsidian statue of a solemn elf warrior. Around the statue's pedestal, hundreds of silver coins lie scattered in the dust. Beyond, a staircase ascends, curving along the tower's north wall.
^2ae

If a character examines the coins or statue, have them make a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check. Silvanesti elves have advantage on this check. On a successful check, the character recognizes that the statue is a guardian common to Silvanesti burial sites and that the silver coins represent souls shining as stars in the night sky. The character also knows Silvanesti tradition dictates each visitor must leave a silver coin on the statue's pedestal.

##### Cursed

A character who proceeds up the stairs without leaving a coin on the pedestal or who takes a coin from the room becomes cursed for as long as they remain within the tower or until the curse is removed by a [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While cursed, the character has disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws.

##### Stairs

The stairs here climb up to area E2.

##### Treasure

There are 451 silver coins in this room, which a character can collect by spending ten minutes. However, a character who removes a coin from this room becomes cursed as noted above.

#### E2: Second Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Heaps of rubble have fallen from this chamber's partially collapsed ceiling. The room holds two stone crypts, while the walls are sculpted with empty burial niches. A door stands to the southeast. Sconces on the walls shed light tinged a faint green.
^2b3

The characters draw the attention of two hostile [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) that lurk inside the crypts here. Once each wraith is defeated, it turns into an incorporeal elven spirit. One spirit quickly fades away, while the other—a woman with light-gray hair and pale eyes—floats through the ceiling and out of sight.

##### Stairs and Ceiling

The door here leads to stairs once used to access area E3. However, the stairs are blocked by rubble that would take hours to clear. The hole in the ceiling 20 feet above is the fastest way to access area E3.

##### Treasure

The two crypts each hold a desiccated elven body. One body wears a [cloak of protection](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-protection.md), while the other wears the nonmagical white robes of a Mage of High Sorcery.

#### E3: Third Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The room's shattered walls stand frozen in time, hovering a heartbeat away from falling apart.
> 
> A sizable hole gapes in the room's floor. To the south, rubble blocks a staircase leading down, while to the north, another staircase climbs to the level above. Dismal gray-green light shines from flickering wall sconces, eerily illuminating yellowed bones fallen from burial niches and scattered across the floor.
^2b7

If the characters defeated the wraiths in the previous level, the elf spirit is here.

##### Regretful Spirit

The woman's spirit repeatedly tries to pick up a sword from the remains on the floor, failing every time. She doesn't notice the characters until she's addressed directly, at which point she shares the following information in a distant, hollow voice:

- Her name is Jentida. She was a guard in a Silvanesti delegation sent to the Istarian city of Onyari.  
- She doesn't know what the City of Lost Names is (as she's unaware Onyari was later called that).  
- She has no memory of how she got here, but she feels perpetually angry—and it feels like her anger is being fueled by something higher in this tower.  
- She asks if the characters know her sister Tenadria, an elf diplomat who disappeared from the delegation. There's no way the characters can know Tenadria, but her remains appear in chapter 7.  

After conversing with the characters, Jentida fades away.

##### Stairs

The stairs leading down are blocked by rubble. The stairs leading up have a door at the top, which opens to area E4.

##### Treasure

The sword the spirit was trying to pick up is a [dancing longsword](Mechanics/items/dancing-sword.md). In addition, characters who search the remains in this room find six onyx gemstones worth 200 gp each.

#### E4: Fourth Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door opens into a room that hovers in a starless night sky. Though the floor is stable, shattered wall fragments float in the air, their sconces emitting a faint, sickly green light. Beyond the broken walls lies an endless black expanse.
> 
> Across the platform stands a stone archway sculpted with sharp runes and the heads of five dragons. Within the arch swirls dense gray mist.
^2bc

The darkness beyond this room's broken walls is only an illusion. This room stands at the top of the tower, not in an extraplanar space.

##### Portal

The archway was created to connect the tower with a friendly realm within the Feywild. When Wakenreth toppled from Onyari, though, its magic was disrupted. Now the portal connects to the Shadowfell.

A character who inspects the portal and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the sculpted dragon heads as those of green dragons, while the runes relate to the natural magic of the Feywild. They also notice the runes can rotate, likely as a means of controlling the portal, but their function is unclear. A character who attempts to adjust the runes without instructions from Veriel in area E5 must make the saving throw detailed in the "Restoring the Tower" section, and they can't close the portal yet.

A creature that steps through the portal appears in area E5 (an endless expanse not depicted on map 5.4). If no character steps through the portal, Veriel (see area E5) appears amid the mist in the arch and converses with the characters.

#### E5: Shadowfell Expanse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You find yourself atop a broken tower of jet-black stone, standing in a barren, unfamiliar landscape. Jagged peaks of colorless rock stretch for miles, and the wind howls mournfully.
> 
> Behind you, faint light shines from an identical version of the stone archway you just passed through.
^2bf

Once the characters enter the portal, they're in the Shadowfell, and they can see the door behind them shining like a beacon of light. Characters can freely pass back and forth through the portal between area E4 and E5, and they can speak through its mist to creatures in the other area.

##### Veriel

An elf spirit appears and greets the characters, introducing himself as Veriel (lawful neutral [ghost](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghost.md)), Wakenreth's caretaker. He explains to the characters what happened to the tower (detailed in "The Doomed Mausoleum" at the beginning of the "E: Wakenreth" section). He knows nothing about the City of Lost Names or its location (as he's unaware Onyari was later called that). Veriel asks for the party's help in severing the link between Wakenreth and the Shadowfell, a feat that can be accomplished only from the other side of the portal. His time spent in the Shadowfell has linked him to this plane, and he can't pass through the portal.

##### Undead Beast

As Veriel relays this information, an [anhkolox](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/anhkolox-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) climbs into view from the tower's edge, drawn by the activity here. Hungry for the characters' life essence, the creature attacks. It ignores Veriel, who stays out of the fight.

##### The Shadowfell

"The Shadowfell" is detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide". Any exploration of the plane beyond the portal's immediate vicinity is beyond the scope of this adventure.

#### Restoring the Tower

After the anhkolox is defeated, Veriel continues his explanation. To cut Wakenreth off from the Shadowfell, the runes on the portal in area E4 must be restored to their intended order, which Veriel shares with them.

The runes on the portal can be adjusted only in area E4. The process takes five minutes and requires a character to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw as Shadowfell energies tug at their life essence. On a failed check, the character takes 17 (`5d6`) necrotic damage and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), then the portal closes. On a successful check, the portal closes without harming the character. Either way, the portal's connection with the Shadowfell is severed.

Once Wakenreth is cut off from the Shadowfell, the supernatural darkness in area E4 fades, the torch sconces throughout the structure shed bright light, and the walls are restored.

#### Conferring with Dalamar

As the characters leave Wakenreth, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) arrives at the ruin. Whether the characters were successful in restoring the monolith or whether they simply share what they've discovered, the mage is pleased with their findings.

Once the tower is cut off from the Shadowfell and cleared of threats, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) takes an hour to investigate the portal. After doing so, he relates the following information:

- Wakenreth was clearly built elsewhere and somehow fell here. He believes he can use the portal's magic to pinpoint where Wakenreth originally stood.  
- To do so, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) must research the magical ley lines underpinning the region and how they're influenced by other sources of magic.  
- If the characters haven't done so already, he encourages them to investigate the Blue Phoenix Shrine and the Sunward Fortress—two sources of unique magic in the region.  
- Once he knows more about the nature of those places and what magic lingers there, he believes he can use Wakenreth's magic to discover the location of the tower's foundations.  
- This should provide him with the general location of the City of Lost Names.  

Once the characters learn (if they haven't already) that the Blue Phoenix Shrine is a holy place of the god Habbakuk and that the Sunward Fortress holds the slaadi Spawning Shard, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) needs 24 hours to evaluate that information and complete his research. Afterward, he directs the characters to a mesa at the northern edge of the wastes called the Giant's Spine (area K on map 5.1), where he believes they'll find the City of Lost Names.

#### A Second Quest

Once the location of the City of Lost Names is revealed, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) is willing to conclude his business with the characters. However, during his research using the portal here, he's discovered a powerful source of magic to the north. He asks the characters to escort him there, not knowing the location is Dread Wolf Cove (area J on map 5.1). If they do, he promises to reward them with whatever they find there and a future favor.

### F: Bluemaw Cave

Bluemaw Cave, an abandoned dragon's lair, owes its blue hue to its high concentration of blue salt crystals. The characters might stumble across Bluemaw Cave or learn about it from the "Heart's Hollow Quests" section.

#### Not-Quite-Abandoned Lair

The cave was carved by a blue dragon that abandoned it long ago. It now houses a family of dwarves who were captured in the south by the Dragon Army but have since escaped. They claimed the cave as a home away from the war.

In a stroke of terrible luck for the dwarves, the Dragon Army leader [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) recently identified the place as a possible dragon's lair and sent draconians to investigate.

#### Approaching the Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A massive cave opens in the cliff ahead. Enormous sapphire-blue crystals line the cave's mouth.
^2c9

Grasha recently finished a pit trap just inside the mouth of the cave. She has been hiding all day in a crevasse near the top of the cave's mouth, waiting to see if any draconians fall into it.

##### Pit Trap

The pit trap is concealed beneath rocky gravel that blends with the surrounding ground. As a character approaches the entrance, they must make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. On a failed check, the character falls 20 feet into the pit, taking `2d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall and `2d10` piercing damage from the spikes at the bottom.

Whether the trap is triggered or not, Grasha hears the characters approaching, and after confirming they aren't draconians, she comes out of hiding.

#### Grasha Migan

The leader of a dwarf family and an enthusiast of gnomish engineering, Grasha wears patchwork knit clothing and her hair in a long braid. Grasha is an accomplished inventor who's fascinated by the rare minerals she's found around Bluemaw Cave.

- **Personality Trait.** "If being a mother's taught me anything, it's the importance of improvisation."  
- **Ideal.** "The best ideas are effective but also a little flashy."  
- **Bond.** "I'll protect my family—their today and their tomorrow."  
- **Flaw.** "Dangerous? My plans aren't dangerous—you just need to know where to stand."  

![Grasha](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/082-05-006.grasha.webp#center)

#### An Honest Mistake

When Grasha approaches the characters, she isn't threatening. Unless the characters are hostile, she deeply apologizes and helps anyone who fell into the trap. Grasha warns against going into the cave, as it's crawling with monsters and draconians.

She explains that she and her clan came here after being captured by the Dragon Army. She encourages the characters not to linger near the cave entrance, lest they draw the attention of foes within. Grasha suggests guiding the characters to a safe spot where they can meet the rest of her clan, but she warns the way might be uncomfortable for larger folk.

#### The Migan Clan

If the characters agree to go with Grasha, she leads them to a small passage near the cave's entrance. Medium creatures must squeeze through the cave's narrow tunnels, and Large creatures won't fit.

After about 10 minutes of following Grasha's meandering path through the caverns, the characters finally arrive at the dwarves' cramped hideout. Other than Grasha, seven other dwarves are present: Reka, Blem, Grap, Lop, Oske, Trop, and Yula. Reka, Grasha's wife, steps forward to gently scold Grasha (in Dwarven) and question who the characters are (in Common).

#### Meeting the Dwarves

Grasha has already decided the characters are the solution to the family's draconian problem. Reka distrusts strangers and is skeptical of the characters, but she wants the draconians to leave so the clan can reclaim the cave. If the characters are willing to help, Reka gives Grasha her blessing to lead them to the lair.

If the characters are hesitant to help the dwarves, Grasha emphasizes that the draconians have been retrieving enormous amounts of treasure from an abandoned dragon's lair in the depths of the cave.

#### Preparing for the Maw

If the characters agree to help the dwarves, Grasha casually adds that, in addition to the draconians, they might have to deal with monsters she calls "fang worms." Grasha doesn't know it, but the creatures are gricks agitated by the draconians' presence.

#### Into the Cave

Once the characters are ready, Grasha takes them to the entrance of Bluemaw Cave. Grasha won't go beyond the cave's entrance, but she assures the characters she'll rearm the pit trap at the cave's mouth to ward off intruders.

#### Bluemaw Cave Features

The cave is carved from igneous rock. Its entrance sports a cavernous 40-foot-high ceiling, and its lower chamber opens to the surface above. The lair also has the following features:

- **Blue Crystals.** Glowing blue salt crystals line the cave's walls, most densely in area F1. Each 5-foot cube of crystal has AC 11, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. The crystals are highly conductive to lightning energy, which a character can determine with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. If a crystal is dealt lightning damage, it explodes in a dazzling blast, dealing 7 (`2d6`) lightning damage to creatures within 10 feet of it.  
- **Lighting.** Crystals fill the upper level of the cave with dim light. The lower level opens to the surface, allowing natural bright light in during the daytime.  

#### Bluemaw Cave Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.5.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.5: Bluemaw Cave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/083-map-5.05-bluemaw-cave.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/084-map-5.05-bluemaw-cave-player.webp#gallery)

#### F1: Crystal Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Blue crystal formations line the walls and floors of this cavern, so dense in places that they look engulfed in ice. The crystals glow sedately with a dim light.
^2d4

Investigation reveals the crystals to be salt, though they have special properties (detailed in "Bluemaw Cave Features" above). The draconians in area F3 can be heard faintly from here, grunting and growling at each other in Draconic.

##### Grick Pack

The characters draw the attention of a pack of seven [gricks](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/grick.md) hiding in cracks in the walls. They were riled up and ultimately scared off from the lower chamber by the draconians. They attack the first creature they see.

The draconians in area F3 have heard other draconians slaying gricks around the cave, so they ignore the sound of fighting above.

#### F2: Descending Cliffs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage descends in a series of sheer cliffs, each one plunging farther than the last into the depths.
^2d7

Three cliffs drop to the lower chamber. The first drops 30 feet, the second 40 feet, and the third 50 feet. Area F3 is visible from atop the last cliff.

#### F3: Sand Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber's ceiling opens to the sky above, and much of its ground is made of fine sand. The cavern walls are engraved with claw marks in intricate geometric patterns. Five draconians labor below, sifting the sand and placing treasures they find into half-filled sacks, while a winged draconian watches.
^2d9

This sand pit is where the dragon spent most of its time. The markings on the walls are artistic renderings of Draconic words, including the name "Nadir."

##### Draconians

A [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and five [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) occupy this room (see appendix B for both stat blocks). The baaz draconians drag treasure from the sand pit, placing it into sacks the sivak draconian can fly out through the cavern's open top. If a draconian spots the characters, they attack while shouting to alert the others.

##### Quicksand

Much of the sandy lair contains 15 feet of quicksand (see map 5.5), which the draconians are already aware of. A character who prods the floor or searches for hazards discerns the pit's dangers with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. When a creature enters quicksand, it sinks 3 feet into the pit and becomes [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained). At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks 3 feet again. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk. A creature that is completely submerged can't breathe.

A creature can pull another creature within its reach from the quicksand by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk.

##### Grick Alpha

If combat breaks out, a [grick alpha](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/grick-alpha.md) and two [gricks](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/grick.md) that were dozing in the sand emerge in a random space adjacent to the quicksand. They indiscriminately attack any creatures in the room.

##### Treasure

The draconians have removed much of the hoard's treasure, but some remains in the sacks here and hidden beneath the sand. The draconians have gathered 700 gp in their sacks. Searching for and safely extracting what remains takes approximately six hours, unless the characters use magical means to move the sand, in which case the time can be reduced at your discretion. The remaining hoard includes 1,200 cp, 8,000 sp, 2,300 gp, 60 pp, twelve assorted gems worth 50 gp each, an ornate chalice worth 1,000 gp, and a pair of [boots of levitation](Mechanics/items/boots-of-levitation.md).

#### Victory!

Once the draconians are dealt with, Grasha thanks the characters for their help. The dwarves start moving back into the cave and offer to feed and shelter the characters for as long as they like.

### G: Heart's Hollow

Heart's Hollow is a small but thriving community of a few hundred people living in the walls of a deep crater. No one in the village knows the community grew from the lair of Nezrah, a bronze dragon who has lived in hiding in the region for centuries. The first residents of Heart's Hollow were wanderers she rescued while disguised in human form. Over time, others lost in the Northern Wastes joined the community and carved dwellings into the cavern's walls, gradually creating a unique hidden village.

If the characters meet Kennah in Camp Carrionclay or Rone in the Sunward Fortress, they might seek Heart's Hollow themselves. Otherwise, use the encounter in the following section whenever you please. Make sure the characters meet [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md), as he plays a role in later chapters.

#### The Dragon Hunter

As characters near Heart's Hollow (or whenever you wish to introduce [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md)), the Wash rises in the region. The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score hears energetic cursing ahead. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Water rushes into the canyon ahead, rising swiftly. The sudden flooding has spurred creatures to seek higher ground—including a human in rugged leathers rapidly climbing a rope out of the chasm, pursued by several horse-sized spiders.
^2e1

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) (neutral good, human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) is being pursued by five [giant spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) as the canyon floods (see "The Wash" earlier in this chapter). You decide whether the characters are in the canyon as well or above it. The giant spiders turn their attention toward the characters if attacked, and they flee if three or more spiders are killed.

After the spiders are defeated, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) proves friendly—and tremendously excited to meet strangers in the Northern Wastes.

![Clystran](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/085-05-007.clystran.webp#center)

#### Clystran

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) has lived his entire life in the Northern Wastes and considers himself an expert on the region. He knows dozens of interesting hollows and rock formations around High Hunt, the plateau that Heart's Hollow occupies. He can share any of the local names for Northern Wastes regions, like "Wormgut" and "Giant's Spine," shown on map 5.1. He also considers himself an expert on the fauna of the Northern Wastes and takes a particular interest in the region's wasteland dragonnels. [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) claims he saw an actual dragon in his youth, leading to a lifelong search of the wastes for where such elusive creatures hide. No one in Heart's Hollow takes his story or lifelong hunt seriously, though.

##### Personality Trait

"I know all there is to know about the Northern Wastes, except where the dragons live."

##### Ideal

"I'll become the best explorer in the wastes."

##### Bond

"Both the Northern Wastes and Heart's Hollow are my home. I'm loyal to both."

##### Flaw

"I can probably squeeze down that hole—there might be a dragon's lair inside!"

#### Talking with Clystran

So long as the characters aren't hostile to [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md), he wants to know all about them. Use the following topics to guide the conversation with him:

- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) wants to know where the characters came from and—if the Kalaman forces are nearby—why their whole village is with them.  
- He doesn't know about the Red Dragon Army in the region, but he has seen strange dragonnels with people riding them, and he's fascinated.  
- He's happy to point the characters toward many landmarks in the Northern Wastes (see "Heart's Hollow Quests" for suggestions).  
- [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) scavenges for his community, looking for anything useful the Wash brings in.  
- He offers to take the characters to Heart's Hollow; he's headed there now. However, he'd prefer their whole army not come as well.  

#### Heart's Hollow Locations

Most structures in Heart's Hollow are carved out of the wall of a deep crater. Patchwork fabrics scavenged from the wastes decorate each home, and lanterns hang in every window. Detail the unique community of Heart's Hollow however you please, including the following locations and landmarks (appearing on map 5.6):

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.6: Hearts Hollow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/086-map-5.06-hearts-hollow.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/087-map-5.06-hearts-hollow-player.webp#gallery)

- **Breakwater Landing.** Breakwater Landing serves as the town square and bartering place. A slate column marked with chalk serves as a community message board.  
- **End's Odds.** Run by Grandit "End" Pike (neutral good, hill dwarf [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), End's Odds sells "slightly used" goods and equipment found in the wastes.  
- **The Fort.** Secrecy is Heart's Hollow's greatest defense, but the town also maintains the Fort, a communal warehouse and armory. Should danger arise, the locals arm themselves here.  
- **Lavender's.** Lavender Jalls (lawful neutral, human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is a renegade wizard who hasn't taken the Test of High Sorcery. He specializes in casting helpful cantrips and brewing alchemical tinctures.  
- **The Mosaic.** Spiraling through Heart's Hollow is the Mosaic, a sloped pathway lined with colorful stones. Every person who visits the village is invited to add a stone to the path, symbolizing the beautiful mark they leave on the community.  
- **Salt Lick.** The Salt Lick is a popular tavern suspended over open air by a web of sturdy cords. Ness (see "Nezrah" below) can often be found here at a table jokingly called "the Mayor's Office."  

#### Heart's Hollow Residents

The lively people of Heart's Hollow are mainly humans, hill dwarves, and kender. Most feel they were given a second lease on life when they were rescued from the wastes or found their way here. Nezrah's desire to keep her community a secret from other dragons has rubbed off on the residents, and they are wary of strangers. However, once someone proves they care for the community's needs as much as their own, locals welcome them for life.

#### Nezrah

The secretive dragon Nezrah (neutral good [adult bronze dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md)) goes by the name Ness. She uses her magic to disguise herself as a middle-aged human woman, and no one knows she's a dragon.

Nezrah has made it her life's mission to build and protect Heart's Hollow. Over a hundred years ago, she came to the Northern Wastes seeking clutches of good dragon eggs hidden in the region, but she hasn't found any yet. Although she focuses on protecting the people of Heart's Hollow, she still hopes to find dragon eggs in the wastes one day.

#### Heart's Hollow Quests

Heart's Hollow serves as a safe place for the characters to rest and resupply in the Northern Wastes. The locals also know much about the region. If the characters have missed any important information during their exploration, they might learn it from [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md), Ness, or another resident of Heart's Hollow.

The people of Heart's Hollow don't know where the City of Lost Names is and have avoided the Dragon Army. They know the location of the Blue Phoenix Shrine, Sunward Fortress, and Wakenreth. They're also curious about other locations in the wastes and might ask for the characters' help—see the locations below.

#### Bluemaw Cave Exploration

A group of scavengers have heard of Bluemaw Cave (location F on map 5.1), an out-of-the-way cavern where they've spotted dwarves living. They'd like to meet the dwarves and perhaps establish a friendly rapport. If the threats in the cave have not yet been defeated, the scavengers encourage the characters to clear them out, but they won't participate in combat themselves.

#### Carrionclay Discovery

No one in Heart's Hollow knows about Camp Carrionclay (location I on map 5.1). However, if the characters recover the dragon egg there and return to Heart's Hollow, Ness urgently seeks them out. She pleads for the egg, swearing to keep it safe. She'll even reveal her true nature to the characters if she needs to convince them she'll be a worthy guardian, but she won't threaten or harm them. If the characters agree to give her the egg, she rewards them with a suit of [bronze dragon scale mail](Mechanics/items/bronze-dragon-scale-mail.md) made from her own scales. She won't interfere in the conflict with the Dragon Army, though.

#### Dragonnel Feeding

[Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) frequently takes dried meat to a flight of dragonnels he's been watching for years. However, he hasn't been able to visit for months and would like the characters' help delivering several packs of food to his dragonnel friends. Their den is at location H on map 5.1. If the characters help him, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) will work for the characters as a scout (see "Heart's Hollow Scouts").

#### Heart's Hollow Scouts

The characters might convince residents of Heart's Hollow to aid them in their travels. If they do, the characters gain the following benefits:

- **Clystran the Guide.** If [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) guides the characters in the Northern Wastes, the characters can ignore "difficult terrain" during travel, allowing them to cover double the distance listed on the Northern Wastes Land Travel table earlier in this chapter. While with the characters, [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) avoids combat and most dangerous situations.  
- **Scavengers as Guides.** A group of scavengers might temporarily join Darrett and his troops. These guides scout for the Kalaman forces through the Northern Wastes, allowing them to move at a normal pace of 12 miles (2 hexes on map 5.1) per day.  

### H: Dragonnel Spire

Twelve [wasteland dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) lair atop this rock formation, which looks like a dragon. Formations like this are common in the wastes, as if the spirits of the dragons killed during Onyari's fall reshaped the land.

The dragonnels avoid the characters unless [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) is with them. [Clystran](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/clystran-dsotdq.md) respectfully lays out the dried meat he brought for the dragonnels and watches them from a distance. After an hour, he's ready to return home, his errand complete.

### I: Camp Carrionclay

The Red Dragon Army established this outpost to serve as a waypoint for its supply lines as it travels across the Northern Wastes.

Characters might visit this location to rescue the sea elves they learn were captured in the "C: Blue Phoenix Shrine" section. Alternatively, if the characters are defeated by Dragon Army soldiers, they're brought here as prisoners.

#### Approaching the Camp

When the characters approach Camp Carrionclay, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead, the smells of rotting fish and burning flesh hang thick in the air. A fortified camp sits atop cliffs jutting from the center of a muddy lake. The camp is ringed by immense bone spurs, with makeshift wooden walls between. A wooden palisade surrounds a camp composed of tents, huts, and a crooked watchtower. Dozens of Dragon Army soldiers keep watch around the camp.
^2f3

#### Camp Carrionclay Features

The camp has the following general features:

- **Walls.** The 15-foot-high walls around the camp are made from driftwood. Each 10-foot section has AC 12, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Sentries.** Three [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) keep watch from the central tower in area I3.  
- **Patrols.** Two groups of soldiers patrol the camp, each including a [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) and five [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks). One group watches the bridge outside the walls, and the other monitors the interior.  

#### Infiltrating the Camp

It's difficult to infiltrate Camp Carrionclay. Here are some ways the characters might attempt to enter the camp unhindered:

- **Entering at Night.** Most troops are asleep at night, except for those on the bridge and in the watchtower.  
- **Posing as Soldiers.** Characters can attempt to gain entrance by disguising themselves with magic or the uniforms of soldiers they've defeated. See area I2 for how such an attempt might unfold.  

#### Camp Carrionclay Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 5.7.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.7: Camp Carrionclay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/088-map-5.07-camp-carrionclay.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/089-map-5.07-camp-carrionclay-player.webp#gallery)

#### I1: Wooden Bridge and Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A wooden bridge crosses the marshy lake, which reeks with decay. The bridge ends at the camp's gate.
^2f8

When the Wash is low, the lake surrounding the camp becomes a marsh filled with marine-animal carcasses and swamp plants, making the area "difficult terrain". When the Wash is high, creatures can swim across the lake, but there is a 50 percent chance they are attacked by a [swarm of quippers](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md).

#### I2: Main Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large, hastily made wooden gate blocks access to the camp. The area is guarded by three imposing figures with twisted draconic features.
^2fa

The camp's only gate is watched by a [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and two [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks).

##### Gaining Access

If the characters disguise themselves as Dragon Army soldiers, they can attempt to deceive the draconians and enter the camp. The guards ask in Draconic where the characters are coming from. A character convinces the draconians to let them through with a successful DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, made with disadvantage if the character doesn't speak Draconic.

#### I3: Watchtower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The bare wooden beams of the camp's central watchtower support a makeshift platform with just enough room for four soldiers to stand comfortably.
^2fd

The watchtower is occupied by three [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). Due to the high vantage point, the soldiers' passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score is 19.

##### Spotted

If a sentry atop the watchtower spots suspicious individuals—such as those not wearing Dragon Army uniforms—they blow a horn to alert the patrols and gate guards in area I2.

#### I4: Prisoner Cages

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four dilapidated iron prison pens hold prisoners of the Dragon Army. Bloodstains spatter the ground beneath and around the cages.
^300

The draconians keep prisoners in these cages. If the characters are captured, they're imprisoned in a cage with Kennah. The cages are guarded by three [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and Urta, a [hobgoblin captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin-captain.md) who serves as jailer.

##### Cages

These cages are 10-foot cubes made of iron and locked with padlocks. Opening a lock requires the key held by Urta or a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A character inside a cage has disadvantage on this check.

##### Sea Elves

Two cages confine three Dimernesti sea elves, members of a group seeking the Blue Phoenix Shrine. Others in their group—including their leader, Yearkal—were taken to someplace called the Sunward Fortress. The sea elves know this name but not where it is. However, they can guide the party to the Blue Phoenix Shrine.

##### Bulette

One cage holds a recently captured [bulette](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md). It's hostile to everyone. If freed, it goes on a rampage, attacking anyone and retreating into the ground once reduced to 15 hit points or fewer.

##### Kennah

One cage houses Kennah, a [kender skirmisher](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kender-skirmisher-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) with 1 hit point and no weapons. Kennah is from Heart's Hollow and was captured while scavenging the wastes. If freed, Kennah can take the characters to her settlement.

#### I5: Zirrok's Hut

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hut is larger than the others in the camp. It's made of hides stretched over a wooden frame, with bone spikes protruding from the ground around it.
^306

This hut belongs to Fewmaster Zirrok, the [hobgoblin warlord](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin-warlord.md) in charge of the camp. Zirrok rarely leaves it. The hut is guarded by two [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). Inside is a cot, a desk, and an ornate chest.

##### Desk

The desk is covered in Dragon Army reports. A character who searches the desk finds letters from a commander named [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) talking about excavating the Sunward Fortress.

##### Ornate Chest

Opening this chest requires either the key held by Fewmaster Zirrok or a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The chest holds a bronze dragon egg, which will soon be claimed by an envoy of the evil cleric [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) (see "Wings of Death"). If the characters give the egg to Nezrah (see "Heart's Hollow Quests"), she rewards them.

##### Treasure

The desk holds two [potions of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) and a [pouch](Mechanics/items/pouch.md) containing 300 gp.

#### Wings of Death

The following event occurs once the characters recover the bronze dragon egg or prepare to leave the camp. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Flapping wings sound above as a hulking creature with black scales descends, roaring as it lands atop the watchtower.
^30b

The creature is Akhviri, an [adult black dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-black-dragon.md) tasked with retrieving the dragon egg for [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md). If the characters haven't left evidence of their presence, Akhviri waits for Fewmaster Zirrok to bring the chest from his tent to the watchtower.

##### True Dragon

On Krynn, chromatic and metallic dragons are considered creatures of legend, and Akhviri is likely the first dragon the characters have encountered. Characters who haven't encountered dragons before have disadvantage on saving throws against her Frightful Presence action.

##### Drawing Akhviri's Attention

Characters must succeed on a DC 21 group Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to avoid Akhviri's notice. If something is visibly amiss at the camp (such as dead soldiers or signs of battle), the DC for this check increases to 26. If Akhviri spots the characters and they're not disguised, she growls in Common from the tower:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Pitiful creatures, lurking in our domain with only your wretched lives to offer. I shall melt you to the bone!"
^30e

At this point in the adventure, the characters aren't prepared to fight Akhviri and should be encouraged to flee. The dragon is proud and believes the adventurers are beneath her, so rather than pursuing them, she uses her Acid Breath once, then calls for any Dragon Army troops remaining in the camp to pursue the characters. Akhviri doesn't follow the characters beyond the camp.

### J: Dread Wolf Cove

After the characters conclude their business at Wakenreth, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) requests they escort him here.

Dread Wolf Cove is usually an unassuming inlet along the coast. However, the cove is lightly obscured by fog that billows from a nearby cave. If the characters enter, they encounter a wolflike [anhkolox](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/anhkolox-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). Should the characters battle the monster, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) (neutral elf [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) aids them.

#### Shard of Darkness

Once the anhkolox is destroyed, a character who searches the cave finds the source of the fog: a rounded piece of broken black glass. The fog ceases if the glass is touched, and it clears a minute later. A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals the shard emanates an aura of enchantment magic. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check realizes the glass is a remnant of a destroyed [Orb of Dragonkind](Mechanics/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md) (detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). The shattered, incomplete artifact has no properties in its current state.

[Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) recognizes the shard immediately but pretends not to. He hasn't decided whether he wants it to aid his people or for his own studies. A character who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check realizes [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) recognizes the shard. If pressed, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) reveals the shard's nature and his intention to have it. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) won't attack the characters for the shard, but he will bargain for it now or concoct a way to steal it later. [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md)'s schemes don't have ramifications for the rest of the adventure, and you can develop them as you please.

After discovering the shard, [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) parts ways with the characters, returning to the elven encampment to plan his next move.

### K: City of Lost Names

The characters learn the location of the City of Lost Names from [Dalamar](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/dalamar-dsotdq.md) after completing the "E: Wakenreth" section. The characters know the City of Lost Names is the Red Dragon Army's destination. Before they head there, they should consider informing Darrett and their allies.

#### The Occupied City

As the characters approach the City of Lost Names, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A vast plateau rises from the wastes, its ancient cliffs soaring hundreds of feet high. A broad canyon splits the plateau's face, its passage blocked by an aged stone wall. Countless red tents spills from the canyon and its gate. Innumerable Dragon Army troops swarm the land, while patrols of dragonnels soar above.
^314

The characters find the canyon leading to the City of Lost Names blocked by Dragon Army troops. The Dragon Army is an overwhelming threat the characters can't likely slip past, as Dragon Army mages see through magical methods of infiltration and dragonnel riders prevent any attempts to fly over. The characters can learn more about the Dragon Army by interrogating captured soldiers or slipping into the camp. Doing so reveals the following:

- The canyon leads to the City of Lost Names.  
- There, the army's leaders—the mage [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) and the priest [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md)—seek an ancient weapon.  
- They are accompanied by the terrifying knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and hundreds of other troops.  
- The canyon to the city is blocked by a simple stone fortification—a remnant of a long-vanished people.  
- The walls surrounding the ruined city are riddled with passages. One leads from the city to Wind's End, a landing point for Dragon Army dragonnels.  

Wind's End is the characters' best chance to access the City of Lost Names. Wind's End teems with patrols of [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) and [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks). If the characters want to sneak into Wind's End, they'll need a significant distraction.

#### The Allied Army

If the characters reveal the location of the City of Lost Names to Darrett, he's prepared to head there whenever the characters please. If the characters haven't learned about the Dragon Army's camp yet, Kalaman scouts can reconnoiter the area and bring back the information from the previous section.

Let the characters discuss methods of slipping into the City of Lost Names with their allies. If the characters don't bring these points up themselves, Darrett notes the following:

- The Dragon Army forces outnumber Kalaman's, but Kalaman has the element of surprise.  
- If Kalaman's forces attack the camp, Dragon Army reinforcements from within the city can reach them only through the narrow canyon.  
- An attack would draw forces away from Wind's End and likely from the city.  
- This would give the characters the opportunity to find the path into the city and strike at the Dragon Army leaders there.  

Darrett believes such an attack is their best strategy. He recognizes it'll come at a cost to Kalaman's forces, but he doesn't see another choice that would allow the characters to strike a decisive blow.

#### Assaulting the Dragon Army

Darrett will attack the Dragon Army, giving the characters the distraction they need to sneak into Wind's End, find the passage, and infiltrate the city. The adventure then proceeds in one of two ways:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you are using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game along with this adventure, consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 7" sidebar instead of running the "Attack on Wind's End" section.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the "Attack on Wind's End" section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 7
> 
> Darrett and the forces of Kalaman launch their attack on the Dragon Army. Things go well at first, but fate is against them, as an additional contingent of Dragon Army troops arrives soon after the battle begins. Read the introduction to scenario 7 in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*, then play that scenario. It details the attack on the Dragon Army forces at the walled canyon entrance to the City of Lost Names and the characters' search for a secret path through.
> 
> At the end of the scenario, proceed with chapter 6 as the characters infiltrate the City of Lost Names.
^warriors-of-krynn-scenario-7

#### Attack on Wind's End

Darrett launches the attack on the Dragon Army whenever the characters choose. When the characters are in position and the Kalaman forces attack the Dragon Army camp, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead lies the outpost called Wind's End, a ramshackle enclosure pressed against massive cliff walls. Beside it, a strip of land has been cleared of rocks.
> 
> Right on cue, shouts ring out to the southwest, quickly followed by smoke and alarm bells. In the distance, the silvery armor of Kalaman's soldiers cuts a swath through the unprepared Dragon Army camp.
> 
> As chaos unfolds, most of the Dragon Army soldiers stationed at Wind's End rush their dragonnel mounts into the air, leaving the outpost vulnerable.
^319

Three [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) remain here with a [Dragon Army dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) in a pen (see appendix B for both stat blocks). While the dragonnel is alert, the officers are distracted by the Kalaman forces and are surprised when the characters attack.

The "Wind's End Battlefield Features" section notes elements of this battle. Soon after the characters attack, dragonnels from the City of Lost Names fly overhead. Some might notice the characters, adding additional threats to this battle (see the "Wind's End Battlefield Events" section).

#### Wind's End Battlefield Features

The battlefield, depicted on map 5.8, has the following features:

- **Crates.** Numerous crates lie in and around the dragonnel pens, filled with water and dried meat for the dragonnels.  
- **Dragonnel Pens.** A large cage encloses four spacious dragonnel pens and an equipment area. Its ceilings are 15 feet high.  
- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents areas from which danger might appear.

#### Wind's End Battlefield Events

During each round of this encounter, roll on the Wind's End Battlefield Events table on initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table if a character enters the Fray or otherwise tries to leave the battlefield.

**Wind's End Battlefield Events**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-the-northern-wastes.md#^winds-end-battlefield-events)`

| dice: d10 | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1–4 | A [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) on a dragonnel flies overhead, firing a heavy crossbow at the character closest to the Fray. The attack has a +4 bonus to hit and deals 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage plus 5 (`1d10`) fire damage on a hit. |
| 5–7 | A dragonnel roars and strafes the battlefield, throwing up a cloud of dust. For the next round, the battlefield is heavily obscured. |
| 8–9 | Two [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) arrive, appearing in unoccupied spaces adjacent to the Fray near a random player character. |
| 10 | A dead dragonnel falls from the sky, crashing in a 10-foot area centered on a random player character who isn't in the dragonnel pens. Each creature in the crash area must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 33 (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). If all characters are in the dragonnel pens, reroll on this table. |
^winds-end-battlefield-events

#### Passage

In a cargo-stuffed alcove at the north end of the dragonnel pens, several loose boards lean against the exposed cliff wall. The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices the gap behind these boards. The boards are easily moved, revealing a 5-foot-wide, 8-foot-high passage that winds into the cliff toward the City of Lost Names.

#### Next Steps

The characters entering the passage in Wind's End concludes this chapter and makes a perfect cliffhanger. As the forces of Kalaman clash with the Dragon Army and the characters make their way toward the City of Lost Names, they advance to 8th level (if they haven't already done so).

The characters will discover what dangers lie beyond this passage in chapter 6.
