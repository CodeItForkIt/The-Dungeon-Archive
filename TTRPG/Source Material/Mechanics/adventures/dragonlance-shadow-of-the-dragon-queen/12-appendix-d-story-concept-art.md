# Appendix D: Story Concept Art
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 220* 

The concept art in this appendix was created to inspire writers, artists, and Dungeon Masters exploring the world of Krynn.

Much of Castle Kalaman survived the Cataclysm and was restored over generations. It is now the center of Kalaman's government and stands as a feat of ancient engineering unmatched in modern times.

The symbol of the Solamnic city of Kalaman captures its impregnable walls and the light of its ancient beacons.

Ancient Istarian structures still stand in the City of Lost Names. The magic that once allowed the entire city to fly still sporadically affects the ruins, causing wondrous structures—like the Threshold of the Heavens—to float in defiance of gravity.

The Bastion of Takhisis, a temple to the ancient gods of evil, survived the fall of the City of Lost Names. Employing magical flames from the Cataclysm, servants of the Dragon Queen raised the accursed structure as the first flying citadel.

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) once carried the symbol of the Solamnic Knights of the Order of the Rose, an emblem standing for wisdom and justice. Since his downfall, Soth carries a burnt, twisted vision of this symbol, leading him to be known as the Knight of the Black Rose.

Tides from the Turbidus Ocean frequently sweep across the Northern Wastes, drowning the region's canyons in the unpredictable, salty waters known as the Wash.

Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) leads the Red Dragon Army forces assaulting Solamnia. She's a fanatical follower of the Dragon Queen who replaced her left eye with a magical gem to prove her devotion.

Kender often adopt functional, patchwork clothing in their travels across Krynn. Every mismatched swatch carries its own story.

The dragonnel rider known as [Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md) numbers among the Red Dragon Army's most infamous leaders. Those who face her in aerial combat inevitably fall in flames.
