# Chapter 6: City of Lost Names
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 135* 

The goal of the Red Dragon Army's invasion is not only conquering Kalaman, but also obtaining a weapon to aid it in conquering all of Solamnia. A contingent of the Dragon Army's forces seeks to restore the ancient magic of the City of Lost Names, raising it as a devastating, flying battle platform. With these forces go [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), who—following whispers from the Dragon Queen—seeks to raise an army of Undead dragons from the draconic graveyard beneath the city. While the characters' allies distract the enemy forces outside the ruined city, the characters infiltrate the City of Lost Names to discover the Dragon Army's plots and foil them.

![The City of Lost Names has...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/093-06-001.chapter-splash.webp#center "The City of Lost Names has known centuries of peace, but now the Dragon Army claims its streets and skies")

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins as the characters venture through a hidden passage into the City of Lost Names. As they traverse this Path of Memories, they encounter an ancient magic-user who tells them much about the ruined city and the broken [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) they discovered beneath Castle Kalaman.

Once the characters enter the City of Lost Names, they find it patrolled by Dragon Army forces. After exploring the city and learning of the army's goals, the party's quest leads the characters to the Threshold of the Heavens, where the black-robed wizard [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) and [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), cleric of Takhisis, seek to restore the magic of the city and raise it into the air once more.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- Characters start this chapter at 8th level, having gained a level at the end of chapter 5.  
- They advance to 9th level during their exploration of the City of Lost Names—likely after reforging the [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) at the Temple of Paladine.  
- After escaping the Threshold of the Heavens and the city, they advance to 10th level.  

## History of the City

The tragic history of the City of Lost Names began long before the Cataclysm. The characters might learn parts of this history during their exploration.

### Departure of Dragons

During a conflict called the Third Dragon War, many generations before the Cataclysm, the hero Huma Dragonbane defeated Takhisis and prevented her conquest of Krynn. When the Dragon Queen left the world, her wicked dragon servants went with her. To maintain the balance between good and evil, most of Krynn's metallic dragons agreed among themselves to retreat to hidden reaches of the world.

### Built on Bones

Centuries passed. In that time, the last kingpriest rose to power in the land of Istar. This religious leader dreamed of an earthly paradise—a pleasure city to reward those he deemed righteous. The kingpriest and his servants created a great flying island. He named this aerial city Onyari, the City Without Sin, claiming it would be a place where he and his worthiest (and wealthiest) subjects might cast off mortal weakness and live like the gods.

But the kingpriest and his servants were loath to reveal how they created their paradise. The city was constructed on an ancient sacred site where, for millennia, dragons of Krynn had gone to die. The kingpriest harnessed the magical resonance of the dragons buried there, lifting the city into the sky.

### Fall of Onyari

When the metallic dragons remaining on Krynn learned the kingpriest had desecrated the resting place of their dead, they were furious. Though some dragons urged a more moderate path, the gold dragon [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md) refused to hold back. He led a contingent of metallic dragons to the soaring city, intent on forcing it to land. The god Paladine tasked the Knight of Solamnia Zanas [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) (see chapter 4) with peaceably ending the conflict between the dragons and the kingpriest. However, [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s quest was a dismal failure, ultimately resulting in the knight attacking and killing [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md). The resulting battle between the dragons and Onyari's people ended in [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s death and the city's ruin. The flying city fell apart across the Northern Wastes, its bulk ultimately crashing in the hidden depression where it lies now.

Not willing to acknowledge his failure, the kingpriest suppressed all records of Onyari, and those who knew of the failed marvel refused to speak its name. In the wake of the Cataclysm, those few who remember Onyari at all know it only as the City of Lost Names.

## Path of Memories

As the characters leave Wind's End (detailed in chapter 5), they follow ancient tunnels through the cliffs surrounding the City of Lost Names. The tunnels eventually breach the ruined city's foundation and wind through substructures of the eastern district. These tunnels and buried ruins are the Path of Memories, and they are far from abandoned.

When you're ready to start this part of the adventure, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage from Wind's End runs through ancient stone, winding through darkness alive with skittering insects. After traveling for hundreds of feet, you pass a large seam in the wall, after which the rock's texture abruptly changes. Ahead, the tunnels stretch on.
^326

The change in the rock marks the transition from the natural stone of the local cliffs to the foundation stone of the City of Lost Names. A character with the Stonecunning trait determines the passage ahead formed naturally, but the surrounding rock doesn't originate in the Northern Wastes.

The tunnel runs several hundred feet farther, then reaches area M1.

### Path Features

The tunnels of the Path of Memories have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings of both the natural tunnels and buried chambers are 10 feet high unless otherwise noted.  
- **Floors and Walls.** The characters can clearly tell the difference between the natural tunnels and the worked marble of ancient Istarian structures.  
- **Slope.** All the chambers tilt slightly down to the southwest, due to the resting angle of the city's eastern district.  
- **Darkness.** The tunnels are not illuminated. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  

### Path Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.1: Path Of Memories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/094-map-6.01-path-of-memories.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/095-map-6.01-path-of-memories-player.webp#gallery)

#### M1: Hall of Betrayal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you approach a fork in the tunnel, the walls burst into green flame that rushes toward you. Spectral dragon heads erupt from the flames, and the corridor fills with furious, hissed words.
^32a

Dragon spirits haunt this area. They are illusory manifestations that can't attack or be damaged. In Draconic, they accuse the characters of trespassing, calling them desecraters and betrayers.

A character can calm the spirits by assuring them in Draconic of the party's innocent intentions. If the spirits aren't immediately calmed, each creature in the hall on the round after the spirits manifest must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or use its action to make a melee attack against a random creature within reach. If no other creatures are within reach, the creature does nothing this turn.

The spirits vanish 1 round after appearing. They reappear after 24 hours if creatures pass through the tunnel again.

#### M2: Fallen Shop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mismatched bones lie scattered around this large chamber. Though the cavern itself is natural, its ceiling has caved in—and with it, part of a building has fallen into the cavern. Inside the collapsed structure are strewn wooden heads and decaying hats.
^32c

A [stone golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) hides under a pile of shattered wood and feathery hats. [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) (see area M9) created the golem and ordered it to attack any creature that disturbs the ruined structure. Any characters who near the ruin and have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher notice the golem.

#### M3: Flooded Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber transitions from natural stone to walls and a floor of worked marble blocks. The passage tilts down to the southwest, where a carving depicts a dragon in flight. Half the dragon's body is submerged in dark water, and the hallway beyond it is completely flooded.
^32e

The flooded hallway, which leads to area M6, has partially collapsed. Creatures of Medium size or larger that attempt to swim through the tunnel will have to squeeze through the rubble. Creatures that attempt to squeeze through must succeed on a DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to progress. If a creature fails this check by 5 or more, it gets stuck, is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), and risks drowning. A creature can free itself or a creature within reach by using an action to shift the rubble and succeeding on a DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### M4: Wine Cellar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A structure from above has collapsed into this cavern. Smashed barrels, shelving, and shards of colored glass clutter the chamber. A staircase that once led up to the east is blocked by rubble.
^330

The ruined remnants of a wine cellar fill this chamber. A character who investigates the glass finds it comes from dozens of spiral-shaped wine bottles.

##### Treasure

A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check locates `2d4` unbroken bottles. The blue wine within is spoiled, and a creature that drinks it is [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour, but the intact Istarian bottles are worth 200 gp each to a collector.

#### M5: Bone Gauntlet

Enormous reptilian bones jut from the walls of this natural corridor. A character who examines the bones and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines these are dragon bones.

When a character makes it halfway down the corridor, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel fills with the sound of rattling as the bones in the walls begin to move, some lashing toward you. Chattering jaws hiss ancient words as incomplete skeletons burst forth.
^333

Three [incomplete dragon skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/incomplete-dragon-skeleton-dsotdq.md) emerge from the walls, missing bones and entire limbs. These creatures each use the [bone naga](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/bone-naga-spirit.md) stat block but without the Spellcasting trait. They fight until destroyed.

Characters who speak Draconic understand the skeletons as they hiss accusations like "You fly on our backs" and "You soar on our bones." However, the skeletons don't understand or respond to anything the characters say.

##### Grasping Claws

Until all three skeletons are defeated, grasping skeletal claws reach from the ground, making the entire hallway "difficult terrain".

#### M6: Flooded Tavern

The ceiling of this room is 20 feet high. The tunnel from area M5 opens into this room 10 feet above the surface of the water.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Murals of dancing people cover the walls, and a small stone stage rises to the west. The lower southwest half of the room is flooded, with the remains of tables, chairs, and a bar barely protruding above the water's surface.
^336

Murky water fills this room to a height of 3 feet, making the flooded area difficult terrain for creatures without a swimming speed.

A [green slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/green-slaad.md) lurks on the stage, drawn to the tunnels by the chaotic magic of the city. If it notices a character, the slaad turns and hisses before using its Hurl Flame action against the character. If a character is in the water, the slaad ignites the flammable liquid (see below). The slaad fights until slain.

##### Firewater

The water flooding this room is covered by an oil slick. Characters with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 18 or higher notice the oil slick if they can see the water. If flames touch the water, the entire flooded area ignites, dealing 14 (`4d6`) fire damage to each creature in the water at that time. For the next minute, as the water continues to burn, a creature that enters the water for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 14 (`4d6`) fire damage.

##### Flooded Passage

The passage to area M3 is partially collapsed and underwater—see that area for details.

#### M7: Ghosts of the Past

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Crumbled chairs lie toppled about the room. On the north wall hangs a long stone slab that features a bas-relief depicting dragons bowing respectfully over a large dragon corpse. A dragon skull is mounted on the east wall.
^33a

This room was once a lounge in an Istarian home. Characters with the Stonecunning trait or proficiency with mason's tools can tell that after the bas-relief was carved, a less skilled hand excavated it from its original stone and transported it here. In truth, the skull and relief were once part of a monument dragons erected to honor their kind—until the Istarians repurposed them for decoration.

Once multiple characters enter the room, green flames blaze in the skull's eyes, and beneath it, the incorporeal bones of a phantom brass dragon appear. The skull glares at the party and says the following in Draconic:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "You built your degenerate throne on our graves and used our ancestors to fuel your ambition. But your gods abandoned you, and we struck you down. You return... and so do we."
^33b

A character speaking Draconic can try to convince the dragon they mean no harm by making a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a successful check, the brass dragon nods and disappears. On a failed check or if a character doesn't speak to the dragon, the dragon's bones manifest around the skull as a complete skeleton. Together, they animate as a [lesser death dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lesser-death-dragon-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and attack.

#### M8: Wizard's Workshop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This worked stone room is full of laboratory equipment: vials of colorful liquids, glass lenses, and live mice in cages. Books crowd shelves and overflow into the floor.
^33d

[Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) (currently in area M9) uses this chamber as a laboratory. Many of the books contain rare lore predating the Cataclysm. If a character spends 1 hour investigating the books here, they find references to a flying city called Onyari and learn all the information from the "History of the City" section. Additionally, they find a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [arcane gate](Mechanics/spells/arcane-gate.md) and a book containing rituals for the [divination](Mechanics/spells/divination.md) and [phantom steed](Mechanics/spells/phantom-steed.md) spells.

#### M9: Demelin's Apartment

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is furnished as a luxurious apartment. Its lamps and stuffed chairs look old but well maintained.
> 
> A hooded, crimson-robed figure steps through a door from the east and gives you a calm nod. From behind a bleached skull mask speaks a smooth voice: "Ah, welcome. Let's get to the assessment, then." The figure holds out a blue gem, which then shatters.
^33f

The robed figure is [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md), high wizard of Onyari (detailed in the "[Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md)" section). Members of the Mages of High Sorcery recognize her robes as those of the Order of Red Robes. [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) has been using the [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spell to monitor the characters and has judged they might be useful in ridding the ruins of the Dragon Army invaders.

The gem [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) breaks is an [elemental gem](Mechanics/items/elemental-gem-dmg.md). An instant later, an [air elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) with an outline resembling a dragon appears and attacks the characters. [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) stands back and watches, taking the [Dodge](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) action until the elemental is defeated. Afterward, she holds up a hand and says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Enough!" The robed figure pushes back her hood and removes her skull mask, revealing the features of an elven woman. "Forgive the rough welcome, but it was necessary to appraise your abilities. I'd like to speak now."
^340

If attacked, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) uses her robes to cast the [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) spell, retreating elsewhere in the Path of Memories. After letting the characters cool off, she approaches them again.

### Demelin

![Demelin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/096-06-002.demelin.webp#center)

[Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) (neutral, elf [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) is hundreds of years old, one of a handful of Silvanesti elves old enough to have lived through the Cataclysm. She commonly wears a bone mask that resembles a skull, and her red robes serve as a [cape of the mountebank](Mechanics/items/cape-of-the-mountebank.md). Prior to the destruction of the world, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) was a prominent member of the Mages of High Sorcery, the high wizard of Onyari, and—along with the Kingpriest of Istar—one of the magic-users responsible for raising the city into the heavens. When the city fell, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) learned a lesson in hubris. The dispassionate mage has since dwelled in the city's ruins, guarding the city to ensure it never takes to the skies again.

#### Personality Trait

"Here's your opportunity to learn from my mistakes."

#### Ideal

"The world's greatest mistakes must not be repeated."

#### Bond

"Onyari is my tomb. We must both stay buried."

#### Flaw

"My time is over. It's up to the people of the new world to avoid the sins of the past."

#### Talking with Demelin

Once the party agrees to hear [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) out, she explains herself. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I am [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md), high wizard of Onyari. You're not the first visitors my fallen city has had in recent days. The world that forgot us has been flocking here, to the paradise of Istar. I fear that although my home has suddenly been remembered, its lessons have not."
^348

[Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) wishes to evict all strangers from the City of Lost Names and ensure the city never flies again. Though the red-robed mage is unwilling to take on an entire army directly, she encourages the characters to drive off the militaristic intruders. She offers nothing but information about the city in return.

Use the following points to guide her conversation with the characters:

- [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) is aware of the invasion of the city, but she doesn't know who these troops are or what plans they have.  
- She shares what she's seen of the invaders' movements. Patrols of soldiers and monsters roam the city, focusing much of their activity on the Threshold of the Heavens at the city's center. Troops also frequently come and go from a sizable mansion that lies along the road to the Threshold. She suspects the latter is a command post.  
- If asked, she explains the Threshold of the Heavens is where the city's flying magic was controlled.  
- She won't accompany the characters into the city, but she gives them a basic overview of its geography (see the "Exploring the City" section).  
- She shares the information from the "History of the City" section.  

#### Demelin and the Lance

If the characters ask [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) about Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s lance, she says she's seen it before. If the characters don't ask about it, she senses its presence. In either case, she tells them it's [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md), which Paladine cursed after the knight slew the gold dragon [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md). She doesn't think its reappearance is a coincidence, and she encourages the characters to seek out the Temple of Paladine in the northeast of the city to reveal why the god has returned the lance to Onyari.

#### Demelin's Test

If any character seeks to join the Mages of High Sorcery, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) notes this before they leave and says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Onyari isn't a place for novices. If you're going to continue, you should do so as a true mage. I was a master of the Tower of High Sorcery in Istar. If you're ready to earn your robes, I can administer the Test of High Sorcery."
^34b

If a character asks for more information before agreeing, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) explains she has administered the Test of High Sorcery countless times, and though these conditions are unusual, she can do so now. See "Mages of High Sorcery" in chapter 1 for details on the Test of High Sorcery.

If a character agrees to take the test, proceed to the following section.

After interested characters' tests are complete (or if no characters want to take the test) and the party is ready to enter the city proper, proceed to the "View of the City" section.

## Test of High Sorcery

The following section is an optional encounter for characters affiliated with the Mages of High Sorcery (detailed in chapter 1). The Test of High Sorcery is a personalized experience that assesses a potential member of the Mages of High Sorcery and determines the order they're most closely aligned with. If a character succeeds, they become a full member of the Mages of High Sorcery and are inducted into one of the group's orders. If a character fails, they're deemed unfit for the organization—if they survive the test.

### Personalizing the Test

The Test of High Sorcery is personalized for those who take it. [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md)'s version of the test takes place in the participant's mind, casting them into a mental re-creation of Onyari's final moments. In this vision, the character faces a magical challenge and a moral choice that tests their values.

When personalizing the test and determining the challenge the character faces, consider the following questions:

- What is the character's alignment?  
- What ambitions and goals do they have?  
- What order did [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) recommend in chapter 4?  
- What order of the Mages of High Sorcery has the character said they want to join?  

### Test Results

The answers to the questions in the previous section might be straightforward and make it clear what order a character and their player want to join. If they aren't, use events during the test to determine what order the character is best suited to.

#### During the Test

The test should involve a clear choice between good, neutrality, and evil as represented by the orders of the White Robes, the Red Robes, and the Black Robes, respectively. As it unfolds, give the character the opportunity to choose any order they please. If the character makes a surprising choice, consider asking the player how they reconcile their choice with their character's values. If the character feels strongly about a choice that conflicts with their values or alignment, their player might use this as a pivotal moment for character growth.

#### Ending the Test

As the test reaches its decisive moment, remind the character's player that their character's choices will result in them gaining membership in a particular order of the Mages of High Sorcery. If the player would like to change their choice, allow them to do so.

### Dying during the Test

The Test of High Sorcery can be lethal, but only if that's part of the story the player wants to tell. A personal sacrifice within the vision that cements a character's beliefs should result in the test ending and the character regaining consciousness unharmed. However, if a character forsakes all magic or refuses to engage with the test, let the player know these choices could result in their character being consumed by magic and dying. If the player approves of this, proceed with the test's events. A character who dies during the test can be resurrected normally.

### Other Characters and the Test

Characters who aren't taking the test are generally unaware of what's transpiring in the test-taking character's mind. If you want to involve characters not taking the test, the test-taking character might create mental manifestations of their allies, which other players can control during the test. If you allow other characters to participate alongside a test-taking character, keep the focus of the encounters on the magic-using character. This should remain a character-defining moment for the spellcaster.

### Running the Test

![To conduct the Test of Hig...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/097-06-003.test-high-sorcery.webp#center "To conduct the Test of High Sorcery, the mage Demelin conjures a vision of Onyari's fall")

When a test-taking character is ready to begin the test, [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) instructs them to move to the center of the room. Read or paraphrase the following text, addressing the test-taking character alone:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) raises her hands. The light in the room pulses, and spectral green flames trace the walls as she speaks.
> 
> "In the old days, there would've been multiple tests. Casting every spell you know, spell battles, the like. But you've proven yourself by coming this far. This leaves just one trial—the most important question."
> 
> The flames swirl around you both, rising to obscure everything but [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md)'s glowing eyes.
> 
> "Time to find out who you are..."
> 
> There's a flash of green light, and suddenly the ground shifts beneath you. Wind lashes your face, and the air fills with screams. Your vision clears, and you find yourself above the clouds, standing at the edge of an exquisite floating city of graceful marble spires. All around you, people flee as dragons dive from the sky, tearing swaths of destruction.
^354

The character taking the test finds themself in this re-creation of Onyari's final moments before the flying city was destroyed. A moment later, a [young silver dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-silver-dragon.md) strafes the street ahead, freezing structures and people alike.

Consider the following suggestions as you develop this scene in a way that's influenced by the test-taking character's alignment.

#### Good Character

The dragon returns and attacks the fleeing people, including both a large group of innocents and a small group of people beloved by the character. There's likely time to save only one group. The character might prove themself suited for white robes by trying to save everyone, by sacrificing themself, or by desperately trying to negotiate with the dragon. If they prioritize what they want over the good of others, they might earn red robes.

#### Evil Character

The dragon returns, and the character's rival or a non-spellcasting ally steps between those trying to escape and the oncoming dragon. Unaware of the character, this rival uses the incredible magic of a glowing staff to hold off the dragon. If the character attacks their foe, tries to steal the staff, or otherwise prioritizes their own ambitions, they prove themself suited for the black robes. If they put the city and innocents first, they might earn red robes.

#### Neutral Character

Scholars struggle to evacuate a collection of ancient tomes (or something else the character highly values) from a crumbling structure. The dragon then returns, threatening both the scholars and a larger group of innocents. There's likely only time to save one group. If the character tries to save themself or the lore-protecting librarians, they're probably suited for the red robes. If they protect the larger group of innocents, the character might be suited for the white robes. If the character tries to abscond with the books, they might be suited for the black robes.

#### Adjusting the Test

The test shouldn't be strictly a combat encounter. The point is to gauge a character's values and disposition. Consider the following suggestions to make the test more dramatic:

- **Altered Magic.** Spellcasting or other class features could function differently during the test. For example, perhaps each time the character casts a spell using a spell slot, they take 6 (`1d12`) necrotic damage or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) that lingers until the test ends.  
- **Dream Logic.** Like a dream, the test doesn't need to make sense or be consistent from moment to moment. It's okay for the character's surroundings to shift dramatically or for unexpected individuals to show up. Don't let these changes make the character feel like their choices don't matter. Rather, change situations to heighten the drama—like by turning innocents into allies or childhood friends.  
- **Timing.** The test should last as long as feels dramatic and end after a character-defining moral choice. If it seems like things are going too fast, raise the stakes and make things worse to see if the character sticks with their choices.  

### Concluding the Test

When the test is complete, there's another flash of light, and the test-taking character finds themself back with [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md). If the character forsook magic or refused to engage with the test, they fall dead. If they completed the test, their clothing transforms into the robes of their new order in the Mages of High Sorcery. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) assesses your new robes. Nodding, she says, "Welcome to the order, fellow Mage of High Sorcery."
^35a

Mages of High Sorcery recognize the character's robes as legitimately gained and view the character as a member of their organization.

[Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) wishes the character the best and urges them to go explore the City of Lost Names.

## View of the City

A door in [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md)'s apartment opens to a path leading up to the street above at the location marked "Path of Memories" on map 6.2. As the characters emerge outdoors, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A glittering city of broken domes and jagged towers stretches before you. The nearby buildings and streets slope down into the basin of a vast, ruin-filled crater. Your vantage provides a view of the entire city, some of its broken districts scarred by fire and flooding. Here and there, crumbled structures and massive rocks bob gently in defiance of gravity. At the city's center, a delicate tower of sharp marble and graceful buttresses rises into the sky. It's made all the taller by its rocky foundation, which floats off the ground.
^35c

Give the players a few moments to ask questions about the city before continuing with the following section.

### Shadow of Soth

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) has brought the Cataclysmic flame from beneath Castle Kalaman to the ruins. In chapter 7, characters encounter the fruit of Soth's efforts to reanimate dead dragons. Foreshadow that threat after characters decide where they're headed by reading the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> To the southwest, the crack of shearing stone sounds from a distant temple whose grounds teem with troops. On the temple's roof, a figure holds aloft a scepter crackling with familiar violet flame. A moment later, a skeletal dragon scales the temple and unleashes a screech that echoes across the city. It pauses before the figure, who climbs onto the undead terror's back. Together, they rise into the air and circle the city before flying south and out of sight.
^35e

The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score recognizes the Undead dragon's rider from Kalaman's catacombs—this is the knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), whose image they saw there.

The temple the characters see is detailed in the "Bastion of Takhisis" section.

Shortly afterward, if the characters have a [fargab](Mechanics/items/fargab-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A) with them, they get a call from [Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md).

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Are you okay?!" Rookledust asks, then she rapidly continues. "We just saw something come over the cliffs—a gods-cursed dragon skeleton! We're retreating, and the Dragon Armies are following. We'll keep them drawn out as long as we can. See if you can get at whoever's in charge in there!"
^35f

Rookledust encourages the characters to find the Dragon Army's leaders within the city rather than pursing Soth. The gnome is confident that Kalaman's forces can retreat safely, telling the characters she has a few tricks in store for their pursuers. Make it clear the characters don't need to rush their exploration of the city to return to their allies.

## Exploring the City

The City of Lost Names lies in a ruin-filled crater. The northwestern district punctured a subterranean aquifer in its crash, flooding its streets, while fire raged through homes in the southwestern district. The western pleasure gardens have become an untamed jungle where descendants of the city's monstrous menageries hunt amid vine-choked streets. Meanwhile, the eastern blocks lie propped against the crater rim, the whole district tilted at an angle.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.2: City Of Lost Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/098-map-6.02-city-of-last-names.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/099-map-6.02-city-of-last-names-player.webp#gallery)

### Making a Plan

Thanks to the party's initial vantage point on the rim of the crater and the information they learned from [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md), the characters easily get a general sense of the city's layout. Provide them with a sense of the city's layout, informed by map 6.2. They can spot the Temple of Paladine across the crater, a glistening dome in the flooded northwestern district, along with the three points of interest listed in the "Dragon Army Activity" section.

#### Dragon Army Activity

The characters see Dragon Army patrols moving through the city. Those who watch the patrols for ten minutes or more note activity at three locations:

- **Central Spire.** A tower rises in the center of the city, surrounded by several dragonnels and smaller flying figures. The tower's foundation floats dozens of feet off the ground. (This tower is detailed in the "Threshold of the Heavens" section.)  
- **Occupied Mansion.** Small patrols come and go from a ruined mansion a third of the way across the city. (This building is detailed in the "Occupied Mansion" section.)  
- **Sinister Temple.** A foreboding temple stands at the south end of the city, its grounds teeming with soldiers. (This temple to the evil gods is detailed in the "Bastion of Takhisis" section. Discourage the characters from approaching it at this point.)  

#### Priorities

The characters can choose their priorities in the city, but they likely fall along the following lines:

- **Find an Outpost.** and learn what the Dragon Army is planning (see "Occupied Mansion").  
- **Learn about the Dragonlance.** and how its curse might be undone (see "Temple of Paladine").  
- **Investigate the Spire.** at the city's center and find the Dragon Army's leaders (see "Threshold of the Heavens").  

Use the following sections to further detail the ruins as much as you please. This chapter concludes at the Threshold of the Heavens, so make sure the characters have investigated the city as much as they want before heading there.

### City Sights

As the characters explore the City of Lost Names, use the City Sights table to describe the ruins.

**City Sights**

`dice: [](07-chapter-6-city-of-lost-names.md#^city-sights)`

| dice: d6 | Sight |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A Humanoid skeleton lies under a fallen aqueduct. It holds a [dagger](Mechanics/items/dagger.md), and the words "we deserve this" are scratched into a nearby cobblestone. |
| 2 | At the end of a boulevard stand two enormous marble feet—the rest of the statue is missing. |
| 3 | The partial remains of an adult bronze dragon lie in a heap between two structures. |
| 4 | A circular tower pierces a dome like a spear. |
| 5 | Vines climb a mural of the kingpriest—a stern man crowned with blazing light. |
| 6 | One side of a long fault line has risen 10 feet, shearing buildings in half. |
^city-sights

### City Encounters

The City of Lost Names is full of Dragon Army troops and other threats. As the characters travel between locations, or whenever you please, roll on the Random City Encounters table.

**Random City Encounters**

`dice: [](07-chapter-6-city-of-lost-names.md#^random-city-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Seven [ghasts](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghast.md) gnaw on dead Dragon Army soldiers. |
| 2 | Bridge Checkpoint (see below) |
| 3 | Three [ghosts](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of bickering Istarians haunt the ruins of their shop. |
| 4 | Dragon Army Engineers (see below) |
| 5 | A curious [death slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/death-slaad.md) wants to eat one of each type of draconian. If the characters help it hunt all five, it rewards them with a [ring of feather falling](Mechanics/items/ring-of-feather-falling.md). |
| 6 | Monster Hunters (see below) |
| 7 | Two [cyclopes](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md)—a mother and her adult son—live in a library, burning its books for warmth. |
| 8 | Patrol (see below) |
^random-city-encounters

#### Bridge Checkpoint

Three [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) stand guard on a 25-foot-wide bridge spanning a 60-foot drop into a rocky fissure. They are quick to investigate any nearby noise or strange sights.

#### Dragon Army Engineers

One [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) and three [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) oversee ten [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) engineers repairing 30-foot-deep cracks in the city's streets. If the Dragon Army members spot the characters or the characters attack them, the engineers stay out of combat. The engineers can tell the characters they're making sure the city's foundations are solid, though they don't know why.

#### Monster Hunters

A [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and four [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) have orders to seek out dangerous monsters lurking in the ruins. They've just found an [Istarian drone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/istarian-drone-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) and are preparing to attack.

#### Patrol

Five [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) patrol the city. They follow a predictable route and, after an hour of walking, check in at their headquarters (see the "Occupied Mansion" section).

### Interrogations

A character who interrogates a low-ranking member of the Red Dragon Army and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check learns one piece of information from the Dragon Army Interrogations table. On a failed check, the captive yells "As the Dragon Queen wills!" until silenced.

**Dragon Army Interrogations**

`dice: [](07-chapter-6-city-of-lost-names.md#^dragon-army-interrogations)`

| dice: d4 | Information |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Engineers work to shore up foundations and make sure the various districts are on solid stone. |
| 2 | The captive takes their orders from commanders at an occupied mansion near the city center. |
| 3 | The Temple of Paladine in the northwestern district is overgrown with dangerous vegetation. Patrols sent there haven't returned. |
| 4 | A black-robed wizard named [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) and the cleric of Takhisis named [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) lead the forces in the city. They spend their time in the Threshold of the Heavens, but no one can enter without a passphrase (which the captive doesn't know). |
^dragon-army-interrogations

## Bastion of Takhisis

At the south end of the ruins stands a temple once called the Bastion of Takhisis. Here, the people of Onyari established the holy sites of all the evil gods, unwilling to spread them across the city but also not wishing to disrespect the deities.

The Bastion of Takhisis has partially crumbled, leaving it a hollow frame within bare, intimidating walls. [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) has claimed the temple as his own, tasking his Undead followers with creating a great brazier there to hold the Cataclysmic fire he stole from beneath Castle Kalaman. He plans to use this as a forge with which to animate the dragon remains buried beneath the city, turning them into death dragons (see appendix B). Using the remains of the dragon [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md), he's already created the first of these terrors.

[Skeletal knights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-knight-dsotdq.md) and other Dragon Army forces guard the temple. Use these forces and other Undead to deter the characters from visiting the temple at this time; they will explore it in chapter 7.

## Occupied Mansion

The Red Dragon Army uses a ruined mansion as a field command post. Characters might determine this mansion is noteworthy by talking to [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) or by observing Dragon Army soldiers.

Characters who wear Dragon Army armor or cloaks gain advantage on Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks made to pass as Dragon Army soldiers while in the mansion.

### Occupied Mansion Features

The interior of the occupied mansion has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings are 10 feet high.  
- **Doors.** The doors to each room are unlocked, except for the door in the kitchen (area O6) leading to the pantry (area O7).  
- **Lighting.** Torches, candles, and fireplaces shed bright light throughout the mansion's interior.  
- **Rubble.** Portions of the mansion have collapsed. The rubble that remains is impassible.  

### Occupied Mansion Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.3: Occupied Mansion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/100-map-6.03-occupied-mansion.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/101-map-6.03-occupied-mansion-player.webp#gallery)

#### O1: Exterior

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the end of a row of ruins stands a partially intact manor. Most of the manor's east side has collapsed, but the rest of the house has been cleared and made serviceable. In the southeast corner, an attached carriage house stands next to the front entrance.
^370

This command post buzzes with activity during the day, with human and draconian patrols coming and going. At night, only the draconian patrols continue.

##### Guards

Four [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) stand guard outside the mansion: one at the carriage house's east door, two at the front door, and one at the back patio door. If attacked, the draconians shout to alert the other draconians outside the house and in the area connected to the door they guard (area O3 or O4, whichever's closest).

##### Patrol

Roughly once per hour, a group of eight [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) arrives outside the mansion, checks in with the guards there, then departs. If the kapak guards aren't at their posts, the patrol ventures into the mansion to investigate.

#### O2: Foyer

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This foyer has an alcove studded with ornate coat hooks under a row of shelves. Stained rain cloaks currently overload the hooks, and several spears lean against the wall. Doors lead to the north and south.
^374

When worn with the hood up, the cloaks here grant advantage on Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks made to pass as a Dragon Army soldier while in the mansion. There are also six [spears](Mechanics/items/spear.md) here.

#### O3: Carriage House

Two sets of metal sliding doors lead into the carriage house. They make considerable noise when opened, alerting the creatures inside. A character who listens at these doors and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears snarling within. When the characters open a door, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This carriage house features horse stalls to the east and an open space to the west. Two broad doorways lead to the street. A metal-reinforced prison cart sits in the northwest corner, occasionally shaking as something growls inside.
^376

This carriage house serves as the base's prison.

##### Draconians

Three [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) stand guard here. One has the key to the prison cart.

##### Prison Cart

A wooden cart with an iron cage built into it holds a [wasteland dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) that had been lairing near the mansion. The troops captured the dragonnel, hoping to train it to serve as a mount. A character can free the caged dragonnel by using the key held by the room's guards or by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If freed, the dragonnel is wary of the characters, avoiding them as it tries to escape to the street so it can fly away. It attacks any Dragon Army troops it encounters along the way.

#### O4: Salon

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fire burns in the marble fireplace of this large salon. The room's tall windows have been boarded over, and its rotted furnishings have been shoved aside to make room for mismatched and gouged dining tables. On the north side of the room, a curving stairwell rises between the back door and a hallway. On the south side, one door leads to the south and another to the east.
^37a

The Dragon Army has converted this room into a mess hall. At any time, two [bozak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md), one [kapak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md), and three [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for these stat blocks) take meals here. They glance up at anyone who enters the room, but they pay no attention to characters dressed as Dragon Army troops.

If a fight breaks out here, the soldiers resting in area O8 respond after 2 rounds.

##### Stairwell

The stairs lead up to area O9.

#### O5: Lower Hallway

This hall leads to areas O6 and O8, then ends in a heap of rubble where the east wing of the house collapsed long ago. The door at the east end of the hall opens into a collapsed room also filled with rubble.

#### O6: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Next to a small pantry door, a fire burns in the kitchen's hearth. Above it, several large roasts hang from spits. Tables stand covered in flour and other ingredients. Additional doors lead to the west and north.
^37e

The command post's cook, Yurl, is a skeletally thin [hobgoblin captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin-captain.md). His apron is covered with grisly stains, which grow by the minute as he hacks at a jackal carcass with an oversized cleaver. If Yurl detects intruders, he attacks with his cleaver (which uses the statistics for his Greatsword attack).

Yurl's apron pocket holds the key to area O7, along with a handful of animal teeth he's been collecting.

##### Pantry Door

The door to area O7 is locked. A character can unlock the door by using Yurl's key or succeeding on a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

#### O7: Pantry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This pantry is crammed with supplies, ranging from hardtack and clothing to weapons and armor. Although most of the crates are made of rough wood, a metal one is etched with designs of blue dragons.
^381

Crates and weapon racks fill this room.

##### Trapped Chest

The metal chest, which belongs to the Dragon Army commander [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), bears a magical trap that can be detected by a character who casts [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) or who searches the chest and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. The trap can be disabled by the [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell. A character who tries to open the chest while the trap is active must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (`5d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The chest can be unlocked by a character who spends 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

##### Treasure

The pantry holds enough food and water for fifty people to survive on for a month, along with twenty [javelins](Mechanics/items/javelin.md), ten [longswords](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), and ten suits of Dragon Army [scale mail](Mechanics/items/scale-mail.md). [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md)'s trapped chest contains three [javelins of lightning](Mechanics/items/javelin-of-lightning.md) and a [pouch](Mechanics/items/pouch.md) full of sapphires worth 1,600 gp.

#### O8: Drawing Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rows of identical cots and weathered packs crowd the floor of this room. Its walls are covered in ornate mosaics that have crumbled with age.
^385

This parlor serves as a barracks for Dragon Army troops not on patrol. Eight [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) are resting here. If they haven't been alerted by noise in other rooms, they are surprised if the characters attack.

#### O9: Upper Hallway

The mansion's staircase connects this small hallway to area O4 on the ground floor. To the east, the hall ends in a collapsed wall. To the northwest, a door leads to a small balcony overlooking the patio.

#### O10: Master Bedroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bedroom is well preserved, with a four-poster bed, a desk, and a small chest. A round turret to the southeast—with glass intact in its windows—provides a panoramic view of the neighborhood's wreckage. A door leads to a room to the east, and another door opens to the hallway to the north.
^388

![Captain Hask](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/102-06-004.captain-hask.webp#center)

[Captain Hask](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/captain-hask-dsotdq.md), an [aurak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B), is writing reports at the desk. Hask knows all the soldiers in his unit, and the characters can convince Hask they're Dragon Army soldiers only with a successful DC 22 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. If Hask believes he's being tricked, he stands and attacks while calling for the soldiers in area O11, who arrive after 1 round. Hask is a devout servant of the Dragon Queen and fights to the death.

##### Command Intelligence

The desk is covered in reports to Hask's superior, referred to as "Glorious [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md)." A character who spends a minute reading the documents learns the following:

- Two Dragon Army leaders, [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) and [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md), work at the Threshold of the Heavens.  
- The passphrase to gain entrance to the Threshold of the Heavens is "By her will: the world."  
- Dragon Army engineers have completed the majority of their work, shoring up the foundations of the city's most intact districts.  

##### Treasure

A key Hask carries opens the locked chest near the desk. The chest can also be unlocked by a character using thieves' tools who spends 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 18 Dexterity check. The chest contains a [pearl of power](Mechanics/items/pearl-of-power.md) and a 200-pound sack, labeled "Payroll" in Draconic, that holds 10,000 sp.

#### O11: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Most of this library's books have fallen to rot, but two desks beneath tall windows stand covered in papers and candles. One door leads to a room to the west, and another opens to the hallway to the north.
^38c

Three [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) work here as clerks, coordinating reports. If threatened, they shout to alert [Captain Hask](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/captain-hask-dsotdq.md), who arrives from area O10 after 1 round. These officers are loyal to [Captain Hask](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/captain-hask-dsotdq.md), and he counts as a Dragon for the purpose of their Draconic Devotion trait. Two of the three officers fight to the death. The last remaining officer surrenders when their allies are defeated.

##### Collecting Intelligence

The clerks know considerable information about the Dragon Army's plans. If a clerk is captured alive, a character can convince them to share the following information by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check:

- The commander of the Red Dragon Army, Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), isn't in the City of Lost Names. She remained with the bulk of the army near Kalaman.  
- The commanders [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) and [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) lead this contingent of the Red Dragon Army. They don't get along.  
- [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) is a terrifying fanatic who claims to speak for the Dragon Queen herself. Even Kansaldi listens to his advice.  
- [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) is a scheming, black-robed Mage of High Sorcery. He's obsessed with ancient magic and venomous beasts, and his research led the Dragon Army to the City of Lost Names.  
- [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) and [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) have worked at the tower called the Threshold of the Heavens for days, preparing to reactivate the city's ancient flying magic.  
- The clerk knows nothing of [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and prefers it that way. The death knight supposedly receives orders directly from the Dragon Queen.  

A character can also gather this information by spending an hour sifting through the reports in the room—though they might risk discovery by the patrol described in area O1.

### Restaffing the Mansion

Soon after the characters leave the mansion, a Dragon Army patrol discovers the intrusion (if they didn't already do so during the party's visit). The mansion is fully restaffed 24 hours after the characters leave, with all Dragon Army inhabitants of the mansion replaced with the same number and types of creatures.

## Temple of Paladine

The Temple of Paladine is among the most intact holy places to survive Onyari's fall. The characters are likely to come here at [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md)'s behest, seeking answers regarding [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s broken [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md).

The temple lies in the city's flooded northwestern district. Buildings here rise like islands from streets clogged with water and pondweed. Although the streets around the temple are flooded, the structure sits atop a hill, keeping it out of the deepest water.

### Temple of Paladine Features

The area in and around the Temple of Paladine has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Unless otherwise noted, the temple's ceilings are 10 feet high.  
- **Flooded.** Most of the Temple of Paladine and its grounds are flooded. Areas P3–P6 are flooded by 3 feet of water and are "difficult terrain" for creatures without a swimming speed.  
- **Lighting.** The temple and its grounds are lit by natural light alone. During the day, bright light fills the exterior areas and dim light fills the interior rooms. At night, all areas are in darkness. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark.  

### Temple of Paladine Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.4: Temple Of Paladine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/103-map-6.04-temple-of-paladine.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/104-map-6.04-temple-of-paladine-player.webp#gallery)

#### P1: Causeway

As characters near the temple's grounds, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead, the water deepens into a broad pond broken by the rooflines of submerged buildings. An embankment rising just above the water is covered in a cluster of violet-leafed trees. The half-drowned ruins of a temple are visible beyond; a platinum triangle gleams on its leaning belfry.
^393

The causeway rises over water that's 20 feet deep. From it, characters can see the temple grounds and the Temple of Paladine itself. A cleric of Paladine or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the platinum triangle as the symbol of the god Paladine.

##### Bodies

Characters with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 18 or higher notice hints of figures wearing red-and-black clothing among the tree branches ahead in area P2. These are Dragon Army soldiers killed by [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md)—but from this distance, characters can tell only that the soldiers are motionless, not that they're dead.

#### P2: Wooded Berm

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The trees here stand shoulder to shoulder, forming a violet canopy as they climb a ring-shaped rise around the temple. Sloping stone stairs climb the rise, and on the other side, another set of stairs descends into the shallow water.
^396

The neutral [treant](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/treant.md) [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) stands motionless amid trees whose branches bear dead Dragon Army soldiers. Before Onyari's destruction, [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) served as its master gardener. The city's devastation left them deeply bitter, and the Dragon Army's invasion has newly angered the ancient creature.

Unless a character openly displays a symbol of a god of nature—like Chislev, Habbakuk, or Zeboim—or is otherwise clearly a servant of nature, [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) uses their Animate Trees action to ambush the characters, then follows the trees into battle. During combat, [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) slowly bellows, "Each defiler you send to my gardens meets the same end. Begone!" A character being attacked by a tree notices a dead Dragon Army soldier amid its branches.

![Duskwalker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/105-06-005.duskwalker.webp#center)

##### Talking with Duskwalker

A character can convince the treant to negotiate by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check as an action or by revealing a symbol of a god of nature. If convinced to talk, [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) reveals the following information:

- [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) is the guardian of Onyari's gardens. The treant endured both the city's fall and the Cataclysm here.  
- Recently, invaders have been trying to fell [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md)'s trees for wood.  
- The treant has killed—and will continue to kill—these "invasive species" that disturb Onyari's plants.  
- [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) will let the characters pass so long as they promise not to disturb the trees.  

The treant refuses to aid the characters against the Dragon Army, wanting only to be left alone. If asked, [Duskwalker](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/duskwalker-dsotdq.md) removes the corpses of Dragon Army soldiers from nearby trees, allowing the characters to loot the bodies.

##### Treasure

Six Dragon Army corpses are lodged 20 feet up in the branches of nearby trees. Each body has a [longsword](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), a suit of [scale mail](Mechanics/items/scale-mail.md), and 10 gp.

#### P3: Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Inside the ring of trees, the ground lowers, creating a flooded bowl. Here, a roughly triangular temple rises from the water, its north side largely crumbled and its belfry leaning. The temple's doors, half covered with water, have begun succumbing to rot, but their platinum inlays of dragons still shine.
^39a

A hostile [marid](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) named Jamir has taken up residence in this area. Once bound by the kingpriest's wizards to power the city's plumbing, Jamir has taken great delight in Onyari's destruction and seeks to punish any who would reclaim the city. If alerted to the party's presence by noise from area P2, he conjures a [water elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) and hides underwater, prepared to ambush the characters. Characters with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher aren't surprised when Jamir attacks. If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he uses [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) to escape at the first opportunity.

##### Doors

The doors to the temple are partially submerged and require a successful DC 13 Strength check to open.

#### P4: Nave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Murky water covers a triangular chamber. To the east, this large hall narrows to a raised area with an altar. The north side of the building is a tangle of fallen stone and beams. The south side holds two doors.
^39d

The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and tall windows admit any light from outside.

##### Hidden Pits

The nave's floor has buckled, creating pits leading to the shattered crypts below. Only creatures that come within 5 feet of a pit and have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) of 16 or higher notice a pit. A creature that steps into a pit sinks 20 feet to the bottom of the flooded hole. The water prevents them from taking damage. For creatures without a swimming speed, each foot of movement costs 2 extra feet as they swim out of the pit.

##### Disturbed Dead

If a creature falls into one of the pits, it disturbs the dead buried in the vault below. One round later, four slimy [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) emerge from the three pits. These lawful neutral Undead seek to defend the temple. They won't converse with characters, but they return to their soggy tombs if a character brandishes a symbol of Paladine toward them.

#### P5: Preparation Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large stone table rises from the dirty water in this round, windowless chamber. Along the walls, shelves hold assorted bottles and vials, most of which have cracked and stained the walls with their drippings.
^3a1

Here, the dead were prepared for burial in the crypts below the temple. These crypts have crumbled, and the stairs leading to them are filled with rubble and brackish water.

##### Treasure

A character who searches the shelves and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds three intact [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [gentle repose](Mechanics/spells/gentle-repose.md).

#### P6: Rectory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small living area is flooded like the rest of the temple, with moldering vestments hanging in a wardrobe and a bed blanketed in fungus.
^3a4

This apartment once housed the temple's resident priest. A character who looks under the bed finds a rusty chest. Its rusted lock can't be picked, but a creature can break open the lock with a successful DC 17 Strength check. The chest is a Small object with AC 19, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

##### Treasure

The chest holds 400 gp, a platinum necklace featuring Paladine's symbol worth 150 gp, two [potions of healing (superior)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md), and a [periapt of proof against poison](Mechanics/items/periapt-of-proof-against-poison.md).

#### P7: Chancel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stone steps rise from the water to a dry platform bearing a triangular stone altar. Sculpted reliefs near the altar depict platinum dragons in majestic poses.
^3a7

The altar here bears the symbol of Paladine, while the sculptures depict him in his draconic form. A cleric of Paladine or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the symbol.

![By Paladine's might, a dragonlance is restored](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/106-06-006.dragonlance-restored.webp#center)

##### Restoring the Lance

As each character enters this area, they gain the distinct impression the dragon sculptures are watching them. Good-aligned characters feel suffused with a warm sense of righteousness. If a character approaches the altar, a column of dim light rises from it.

If a character places [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s lance on the altar in this light, the lance shines with a silvery glow. The rust covering the lance bubbles and leaks a dark liquid that flows away from the altar and disappears. At the same time, the spear lengthens, growing into a whole, newly forged, pike-length [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) (see appendix A).

Before a character takes the reforged lance, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From nowhere and everywhere comes a powerful voice that inspires confidence and awe.
> 
> "The last to wield this weapon was unworthy. His failure was a step along the path to the world's destruction. But this new age needs a new hope. Use this weapon to defend the destiny mortals have chosen. Banish the shadow of the Dragon Queen with the light of this most sacred weapon. With the blessing of the gods, ye champions, reclaim the *dragonlance*."
^3a9

Any character with the [Divinely Favored feat](Mechanics/feats/divinely-favored-dsotdq.md) (from chapter 1) knows this is the voice of the god Paladine.

A moment later, a wave of light sweeps through the temple, healing each creature present as if by the [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md) spell. If any characters died during this chapter, they immediately come back to life as if by the [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell, their bodies appearing in the chancel if they're not already present. The light then vanishes.

### Character Advancement

Once the [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) is reforged at the Temple of Paladine and the party explores the command post in the "Occupied Mansion" section, characters advance to 9th level.

## Threshold of the Heavens

At the center of the ruins floats the section of the city bearing the Threshold of the Heavens, the tower that controlled the city's magical flight. The characters might decide to explore the tower because of their conversation with [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md) or their discoveries at the occupied mansion.

Before they infiltrate the tower, make sure the characters are 9th level and have done everything else they want to in the city. Events in the tower will prevent further exploration. If you need to deter the characters, a group of [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) or [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) is conducting drills here when they arrive.

### Reaching the Threshold

Though the rest of Onyari lost its capacity for flight, the island supporting the Threshold of the Heavens still bobs in the air. This island is 30 feet off the ground, requiring Dragon Army troops to fly to reach the tower. Characters might find a way to do the same. Alternatively, a character can ascend by leaping between a series of floating rocks and succeeding on three DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks. A character ascends 10 feet with each successful check. If they fail a check, they make no progress. If they fail a check by 5 or more, they fall to the ground and must start the process over.

### Threshold Features

The areas inside the Threshold of the Heavens have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings throughout are 30 feet high.  
- **Doors.** The doors are all unlocked. Though made of heavy stone, they open quietly.  
- **Lighting.** Magical lighting embedded in the ceilings fills the Threshold's rooms with bright light.  

### Threshold Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.5.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.5: Threshold of the Heavens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/107-map-6.05-threshold-of-the-heavens.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/108-map-6.05-threshold-of-the-heavens-player.webp#gallery)

#### T1: Plaza

Once characters reach the floating island of the Threshold of the Heavens, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Atop the floating island, a slender, gray obelisk rises nearly two hundred feet above the surrounding plaza. Four graceful flying buttresses curve up the tower's entire height, and crystalline windows punctuate its summit. At the tower's base stands a single stone door. Four hulking draconians guard the door, while armored dragonnels and their riders circle above.
^3b0

An open plaza stretches for 100 feet on each side of the tower, ending at the island's edge.

##### Tower Patrol

Three [Dragon Army officers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) mounted on [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) patrol near the tower. They ignore creatures wearing Dragon Army armor but confront anyone else on the floating island. If the tower's guards are attacked, this patrol arrives to aid their allies in 2 rounds.

##### Tower Guards

Four [sivak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) guard the tower's entrance. They halt anyone who tries to enter, whether wearing Dragon Army armor or not, and demand they state the passphrase. If a character responds with the passphrase they learned in the "Occupied Mansion" section ("By her will: the world") the draconians let the characters pass. If they don't speak the passphrase, a character must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to fool the sivaks; otherwise, the sivaks attack. Characters wearing Dragon Army armor or similar garb have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence the tower's guards. The draconians ignore sounds inside the tower.

#### T2: Entry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Murals of idyllic life in the flying city adorn this grand foyer's gray stone walls. One on the west wall depicts a handsome, long-haired man in flowing robes, radiating golden light. Fountains burble to the north and south. The east wall holds a single door to the north and a double door to the south.
^3b4

The kingpriest insisted the Threshold was a holy place, but little besides the holy water fonts here remains of its religious trappings.

##### Guardians

A [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md) named Guelfost and his handler, a [bozak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) named Orm, serve [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) and have been assigned to guard this level of the tower. Orm demands visitors state their business. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to convince Orm the characters have business in the tower.

Guelfost has orders to obey his handler, but they don't compel him to fight after Orm dies. If Orm is defeated, Guelfost ceases attacking. If not attacked further, he shares his name and the following facts:

- He is magically compelled to serve a black-robed wizard named [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md).  
- He's wary of [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md)'s co-commander, [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), who holds some secret power.  
- If asked about dangers above, the devil notes the next floor has a chamber filled with dangerous energy. The characters can pass safely by speaking the Istarian word "cetteth."  

After his draconian handler is defeated, Guelfost doesn't leave the room or act against the characters unless [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) orders him to.

##### Fonts

The two fonts are half-full of magically preserved holy water. Each font holds the equivalent of four [flasks of holy water](Mechanics/items/holy-water-flask.md).

#### T3: Tower Monitoring

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two long consoles jut from the walls of this room, covered in levers, colored stones, and dull glass hemispheres. Etched into the floor between the consoles is an elaborate symbol radiating orange light.
^3b8

This room monitors the tower's magic and its connection to the city beyond.

##### Consoles

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check discovers the consoles monitor a powerful source of magic elsewhere in the tower. They also determine that even though the magic is currently active, the controls indicate something is malfunctioning. If the character wishes, they can use the console to diminish the power of this magic, but they can't deactivate it completely.

##### Diminished Magic

If a character uses the console to throttle the tower's magic, the symbol in the center of the room turns red, and the Threshold's entire floating island plummets 10 feet. After this, a failsafe stops the island from falling, returns the rune to its original orange color, and disables the console. The experience is startling, but it doesn't harm the tower or creatures on the island.

If the tower drops in this manner, [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) commands the three [flameskulls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) in area T7 to find the source of the problem. One minute later, the flameskulls find the characters (regardless of their location in the tower) and attack.

##### Symbol

The symbol on the floor sheds dim orange light out to 5 feet. A character who sees the symbol and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes it looks like an aerial view of the tower and its exterior buttresses.

#### T4: Energy Field

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Nine blue crystalline columns crackle and hiss as lightning arcs unpredictably between them. A double door leads to another room to the north, and a smaller door leads to the stairs down.
^3bd

This chamber functions as a defense for the tower and part of the tower's broader magical systems.

##### Lightning

When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) lightning damage from lightning arcing between the columns. If a character says "cetteth" while on this level of the tower, they become immune to the lightning generated by this room for 24 hours.

##### Crystal Columns

The columns in this room are Large objects with AC 16, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If three or more of the room's nine columns are destroyed, lightning stops arcing between the columns, ending the effect described above. The first time a column in the room takes damage, a 10-foot-square panel opens in the floor near the door leading to area T5, releasing a hostile [Istarian drone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/istarian-drone-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B).

#### T5: Drone Monitoring

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stone columns inset with glowing crystal bands run along the north side of this room. Between the columns stand two still, insect-like constructs. Sporadically, lightning arcs between a column and one of the constructs. To the southeast, an array of runes pulses on a console. In the middle of the south wall stands a small door and, to the west of it, a larger double door.
^3c1

In this room, workers would charge and repair the tower's construct defenders. The two [Istarian drones](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/istarian-drone-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) are intact but powered down. They activate and attack in the room if a drone, a column, or the console is damaged.

##### Console

A character adjacent to the console who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can use an action to direct one of the Istarian drones in this room to move or attack a creature. The drone fulfills this order to the best of its ability, and will attack until its target leaves the room or is dead.

#### T6: City Overview

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the middle of this room stands a three-foot-tall, circular metal pedestal. Atop it, hundreds of tiny illusory buildings glow in a pale yellow light, and in their center floats a miniature illusion of the Threshold of the Heavens. Four crystal globes mounted on the walls glow with the same light, projecting illusory images onto the pedestal. Doors lead to the north and west, and a third door leads to the stairs down.
^3c4

The pedestal here is an illusory representation of Onyari prior to its crash. Sections of the illusion flicker, the structures fading in and out of existence. These flickering sections correspond to parts of the city that have been destroyed or radically changed.

#### T7: Communications

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three chairs are scattered across this room. Blackened consoles against the west and south walls buzz softly and occasionally emit sparks. Doors lead to the north and east.
^3c6

The consoles once performed a magical function, but Dragon Army soldiers accidentally destroyed them. The consoles now buzz with misfiring magic. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines the consoles are broken beyond their ability to repair.

##### Flameskulls

Since whatever accident befell this room, [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) doesn't allow Dragon Army soldiers higher than this floor. Three [flameskulls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) guard this room and attack any creature other than [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) that enters. The flameskulls are no longer present if they went to investigate area T3.

#### T8: Navigation

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large table fills the center of this room, and beyond it, the north wall holds a door. Atop the table, a three-dimensional illusion depicts a vast, rocky expanse in meticulous detail.
^3c9

Two [aurak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) lean over the table, intensely studying it. They can be surprised by a character who succeeds on a DC 8 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

##### Magical Map

The magical map on the table changes as the city flies, accurately depicting the landscape for many miles around the city. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check recognizes the map depicts the Northern Wastes, and they can pick out large groups of soldiers moving south of the city: Dragon Army forces and the Kalaman troops.

#### T9: Scrying Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Window-like crystal panels dominate the walls of this room, each displaying a different image. Three show crackling thunderheads, and the fourth depicts the city of Kalaman. In the center of the room, stone desks with magical consoles surround a raised platform. Doors lead to the north and south.
^3cc

This chamber's scrying magic informed the city's navigators of storms and other approaching threats. The black-robed wizard [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B), who hunches over the southwest desk here, has been using his magic to alter the magical mirrors' focuses, fixing one on Kalaman.

##### Talking with Lohezet

[Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) is surprised to see strangers. After discerning the characters' agenda, he tries to convince them he's been forced to serve the Dragon Armies. A character can determine he's lying with a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If the characters see through his lie, he tries to bargain and shares the following information:

- [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) doesn't care about the Dragon Armies' goals; they just support his research.  
- He discovered the City of Lost Names's location while with the Black Dragon Army in the east.  
- The Threshold of the Heavens is the control center of the city. He and the priest [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) have reactivated the magic here. They now await orders to raise the city into the sky.  
- [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), who is currently in the chamber above, is a fanatical worshiper of the Dragon Queen. If the characters slay [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) will leave the city without complaint.  

[Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) might make good on his word to leave, or he might ambush the characters later—he'll decide after seeing how they fare against [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md).

##### Scrying Mirrors

[Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) has manipulated one of the mirrors to spy on Kalaman, looking down on the city as if from high above. A character who spends 10 minutes and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can restore the mirror to its original use. The mirrors can't be used to view any other locations. Each mirror is a Medium object with AC 13, 8 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

##### Treasure

Atop a console, [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) has placed Istarian relics he's investigating. These include six platinum tower components worth 200 gp each, a [gem of brightness](Mechanics/items/gem-of-brightness.md), and a [candle of invocation](Mechanics/items/candle-of-invocation.md).

#### T10: Bridge

![At the Threshold of the He...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/109-06-007.belephaion-true-form.webp#center "At the Threshold of the Heavens, Belephaion reveals his true form")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Enormous windows fill the walls of this room, granting a breathtaking view of the City of Lost Names. Lowered walkways line three walls like orchestra pits, while a dais in the center holds a bejeweled throne whose back is carved like the rays of the sun. Seated on the throne is a human man dressed in crimson robes and wearing a crown bearing the Dragon Queen's symbol.
^3d1

[Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) (see below) sits on the throne in this room. Two [bozak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) attend him, one in the walkway to the southwest and the other in the walkway to the southeast.

When [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) sees the characters, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It seems [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) has finally been dealt with." The man on the throne brings his hand down on a crimson jewel on the throne's arm. "No more need for his incessant human cautiousness. Glory will be mine alone. It is the Dragon Queen's will!"
> 
> The jewels on the throne pulse. Beneath you, the floor lurches. Through the windows, the city's towers shudder, and the ruins begin to rise into the air.
^3d2

[Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) has activated the throne's magic, with dire ramifications for the city (see "Helm" below).

##### Belephaion

[Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md), who's secretly a blue dragon, is currently in his priest form. He uses the [young blue dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-blue-dragon.md) stat block with the following action:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Alter Shape.** [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) magically transforms into an [eagle](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/eagle.md) or a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), while retaining his alignment, damage immunities, hit points, Hit Dice, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This transformation ends if he is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
^3d4

[Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) mocks the characters and promises to send their souls to the Dragon Queen. As soon as the characters threaten or attack him, he orders the draconians to attack, transforms into his dragon form, and joins in battle. He fights to the death.

##### Helm

The throne is a [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A) attuned to [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md). As soon as the device activates, the entire city begins to hover. See "The City Rises" section for details.

##### Treasure

[Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) carries a portion of his hoard with him in a [bag of holding](Mechanics/items/bag-of-holding.md) he wears. The bag contains 1,000 gp worth of ancient coins, a ruby holy symbol of Takhisis worth 250 gp, and an [Ioun stone (insight)](Mechanics/items/ioun-stone-insight.md). His crown is worth 3,500 gp.

##### Windows

Each of the four crystalline windows in this room is a Huge object with AC 13, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

## The City Rises

As soon as [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) activates the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) atop the Threshold of the Heavens, the City of Lost Names lifts into the air. However, the device is damaged and can't effectively lift the shattered city. As a result, different parts of the ruins rise at different rates, tearing the city apart.

If [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) is killed, no one is attuned to the *flying citadel helm* and the Threshold's floating island ceases to rise. However, the rest of the city continues breaking apart and rising into the sky. Even if [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) is taken alive, he refuses to lower the city. The characters can't prevent the city from falling apart. Their only option is to escape, first from the tower, then from the city.

### Threshold Evacuation

After [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) is defeated, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The shaking underfoot continues. Outside the windows, boulder-sized chunks of the city tear free, rising into the air. Beneath them, whole districts shudder as mighty forces tug them skyward.
> 
> Deep in the tower, something cracks. The floor under you slants as the tower begins to slowly lean.
^3db

The Threshold of the Heavens and the island it stands on are beginning to crumble. The characters have enough time to escape the tower, but encourage them to make a quick exit by describing cracking walls and stones dropping from the ceiling.

Characters who try to use the [flying citadel helm](Mechanics/items/flying-citadel-helm-dsotdq.md) can make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. If they succeed, they realize it'd take several hours to attune to it and regain control of the city—and the tower isn't going to survive that long.

### Soth's Ascent

As the party gets clear of the tower, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You find yourself amid disaster as ragged stone islands and crumbling buildings rise into the sky. Chaos confounds the Dragon Army troops throughout the city. Dragonnels dodge stones in the skies, while winged draconians race to escape cracking streets.
> 
> To the south, violet flame lights the sky. At its center, a solid island rises, its stone foundations riddled with monstrous bones. The island bears an ominous temple, windows alight with otherworldly violet flame. As you watch, the undead dragon ridden by [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) returns, and the two circle this blazing flying citadel.

This temple rising into the sky is the Bastion of Takhisis. Cataclysmic flame has awoken the dead dragons beneath the citadel, and their magic now holds it aloft similarly to how it once supported the whole city. While the rest of the ruins drift wildly, the Bastion of Takhisis rises as a flying citadel—a terrible weapon and the first of its kind.

### Escaping the City

Allow the characters to choose their route to escape the city. The Path of Memories and the canyon to the south are both logical choices. If the party seeks out [Demelin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/demelin-dsotdq.md), the wizard is nowhere to be found. As the characters flee, narrate the city crumbling around them. Use any of the following encounters to highlight the chaos of their escape.

#### Escaped Dragonnels

Four [Dragon Army dragonnels](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) have been separated from their riders. A character can convince the dragonnels to let the characters ride them out of the city by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Afterward, the dragonnels drop the characters off and depart.

Alternatively, if the characters saved the [wasteland dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wasteland-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) in the occupied mansion, it might return with other dragonnels to help them escape.

#### Floating Rocks

The characters find their path impeded by a 30-foot ascent or descent between levels of the ruins. A character can jump between a series of floating rocks to navigate this obstacle. The character must succeed on three DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to leap from rock to rock. A character safely ascends or descends 10 feet with each successful check. If they fail a check, they make no progress. If they fail a check by 5 or more, they fall to the lower level.

#### Ill-Fated Ambush

A patrol of three [kapak draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and one [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks) spots the characters and attacks. At the end of the first round of combat, roll a die. If you roll an even number, a random draconian is affected as if by the [levitate](Mechanics/spells/levitate.md) spell (save DC 15) for 1 minute. If you roll an odd number, a boulder falls on a random draconian, dealing 33 (`6d10`) bludgeoning damage to it.

## Escaping the Enemy

Once the characters escape the City of Lost Names, they'll want to rejoin the Kalaman forces. They can use the [fargab](Mechanics/items/fargab-dsotdq.md) to learn where Darrett and their allies are; otherwise, soon after they escape the city, a small group of Kalaman soldiers finds them and leads them to the larger force.

The upheaval in the City of Lost Names has caused a momentary interruption in the conflict between the Red Dragon Army and Kalaman's forces. However, the Red Dragon Army is regrouping.

The adventure unfolds in one of two ways from here:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you are using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game along with this adventure, consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 8" sidebar.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the following section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 8
> 
> Soon after the characters reunite with their allies from Kalaman, the Dragon Army musters its scattered forces and prepares to pursue the fleeing Kalaman troops. Read the introduction to scenario 8 in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*, then play that scenario. This scenario details the flight of the Kalaman forces from the City of Lost Names. If the characters attain a hold during this scenario, their allies hail them and share one [potion of healing (superior)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md) with each character. If the characters attained a win, the survivors also gift them a [ring of resistance (fire)](Mechanics/items/ring-of-fire-resistance.md) taken from a defeated Dragon Army officer. Characters gain no benefit for a loss.
> 
> At the end of the scenario, proceed with the "A New Threat" section.

### Swift Retreat

When the characters reunite with Kalaman's soldiers, Darrett welcomes them back, but he keeps the conversation short. The Dragon Army is mustering and soon will strike at Kalaman's forces again. Darrett has lost a substantial number of troops after several skirmishes and hit-and-run attacks. He suggests retreating to the south as swiftly as possible.

### A New Threat

As the characters and Kalaman's troops slip away from the Dragon Army, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As the cliffs surrounding the City of Lost Names grow distant, their red stone walls take on a violet hue. A floating island drifts over them, crowned by a terrifying temple smoldering with Cataclysmic flames. As the flying citadel takes up position over the rallying Dragon Army troops, you can make out crimson pennants fluttering on this terrible new weapon in the Dragon Queen's arsenal.
^3e6

The flying citadel baffles and terrifies Kalaman's forces, but Darrett urges calm as the army focuses on escaping. He wants to know all about the flying citadel, but he delays that conversation until the army is well out of its sight. For the moment, his focus is ensuring the safety of his troops, escaping to the south, and alerting Kalaman's defenders about this terrible new weapon.

### Next Steps

After escaping the City of Lost Names, the characters advance to 10th level. Chapter 7 begins as the characters, Darrett, and the outmatched Kalaman troops depart the Northern Wastes. With time running out, they must prepare Kalaman to face the Dragon Army's newest threat.
