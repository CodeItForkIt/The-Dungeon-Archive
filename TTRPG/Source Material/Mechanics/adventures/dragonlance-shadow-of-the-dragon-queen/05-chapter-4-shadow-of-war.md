# Chapter 4: Shadow of War
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 77* 

Vogler is gone, devastated by the Red Dragon Army. After escaping the village by following the Vingaard River, the characters and other survivors seek refuge in the city of Kalaman. They carry with them a warning: war is coming for Kalaman. The city's leaders recruit the characters to help identify and resist the threat of the Red Dragon Army. As the characters travel the lands around Kalaman, they learn more about the Dragon Army's goals and the terrifying shadow behind this war.

## Running This Chapter

This chapter begins with an overview of the city of Kalaman. After familiarizing yourself with the "Kalaman Gazetteer" section, continue the adventure with the characters and Vogler's refugees arriving near the city. Once the characters ensure the villagers' safety, encourage them to follow [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md)'s lead by joining—or at least collaborating with—Kalaman's military. The military provides the support and direction necessary to face the Red Dragon Army and its supernatural allies for the rest of the adventure.

### Character Advancement

In this chapter, level advancement is handled as follows:

- Characters start this chapter at 4th level, having gained a level after evacuating Vogler.  
- Characters advance to 5th level before retaking Wheelwatch Outpost.  
- Characters advance to 6th level after defeating the skeletal knight Zanas [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) at the end of the chapter.  

## Kalaman Gazetteer

Kalaman, the Beacon of the East, is one of the largest cities in Solamnia. Far from the nation's heartland and the capital of Palanthas, the city is a bastion of trade and safety at the edge of the province of Nightlund. This section provides an overview of the city. Flesh out its locations and residents however you please. The city will be the party's home for the rest of this adventure, and their connections to the city will encourage them to defend it against the Dragon Army threat.

### Knowledge of Kalaman

Characters who are from Kalaman or succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check know the following details about the city:

- **Capital City.** Kalaman is the capital of the Solamnic province of Nightlund.  
- **Ancient Bastion.** Kalaman is a thriving trade city known for its strong walls, castle, and harbor beacons, all of which predate the Cataclysm.  
- **Rulers.** The city is led by a governor, a council of prominent guild leaders, and a military marshal.  
- **Military.** Kalaman maintains a significant military force to deter raiders from Estwilde and monsters from the Dargaard Mountains.  
- **Vingaard Port.** The city sits at the mouth of the Vingaard River, about thirty miles downriver from Vogler.  

### Power in Kalaman

Kalaman is led by the following three groups:

- **Governor.** The head of Kalaman's government is Governor Calof Miat (lawful neutral, human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)). He represents the city's people and speaks on their behalf during council sessions.  
- **Guild Leaders.** A council composed of the leaders of the city's five most prominent guilds—the Cartographers' Guild, Dockhands' Guild, Fishers' Guild, Masons' Guild, and Shipwrights' Guild—oversees the city's broad business interests and runs varied public services. The guilds' leaders are neutral human and hill dwarf [nobles](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) who are prone to bickering and jockeying for influence.  
- **Marshal.** Kalaman's military guards the city and defends eastern Solamnia. The military is robust, as the city can't afford to solicit aid from the Knights of Solamnia, headquartered in the west, every time raiders from Estwilde or other threats cross the border. Kalaman's military is commanded by the pragmatic Marshal Nestra Vendri (lawful neutral, human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)).  

### Kalaman Locations

While in Kalaman, the characters might visit any of the locations in this section. These sites appear on map 4.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.1: Kalaman](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/054-map-4.01-kalaman.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/055-map-4.01-kalaman-player.webp#gallery)

#### Castle Kalaman

A symbol of the city, the age-old fortress of Castle Kalaman rises atop rugged cliffs, visible from anywhere within the city walls and for miles beyond. The city's governor dwells within the castle, and the ruling council holds its meetings here. Castle Kalaman also serves as the headquarters of Kalaman's military, and its barracks can house hundreds of troops. Extensive catacombs run beneath Castle Kalaman, but the entrances to these tunnels were closed long ago and remain magically sealed.

#### City Market

Merchants from across Ansalon do business in Kalaman's thriving bazaar. Characters can purchase any "equipment" from the "Player's Handbook" here. Vendors from far-off lands—like Ergoth or Mount Nevermind—often bring rare curios here to trade.

#### Hammerstrike Forges

Twin forges stand across the street from one another, run by the dwarven cousins Kadmos and Tiria Hammerstrike (both lawful neutral, hill dwarf [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)). While both are competent smiths, Kadmos specializes in armor and Tiria excels with weaponry.

#### Harbor Beacons

The walls of Kalaman extend several hundred feet into the city's harbor. The tower at each end holds a prominent beacon surrounded by an array of lenses. These beacons were created before the Cataclysm by the city's Istarian founders, and the light from their flames cuts through the densest fog.

#### Kalaman Harbor

At any time, dozens of ships are anchored along the busy docks of Kalaman's harbor. Small local fishing ships vie for harbor space alongside mighty seafaring vessels, some from far-off lands. Every day there's a 10 percent chance a merchant ship from a distant land puts into port here, its crew eager to sell unique wares and tell tales of danger on the sea.

#### Meulara's Oddities

Meulara's Oddities is a small shop piled with trinkets. Its shopkeeper, Meulara (chaotic good, kender [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), is a silver-haired woman with a bright smile. Meulara claims to know every kender in the city, and most kender new to town are directed to her so they can swap stories and news from their travels.

#### The Steady Beacon

The Steady Beacon is a tavern that boasts a large taproom, a fish-focused menu, and modest lodging. Its decor features the broken weapons of defeated bandits. The tavern is a favorite of Kalaman's soldiers, and most evenings, dozens of off-duty troops relax here. The inn's owner, Jesen Thold (neutral good, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)), is a friend of Marshal Nestra Vendri, head of Kalaman's military.

#### Trade Camps

Outside the city to the east and west sprawl trade camps. These expanses of ramshackle buildings began as campgrounds for caravans. Over time, the tents were replaced by simple buildings aligned along muddy streets. They now house hundreds who can't find lodgings within the city's walls.

#### Wyhan's Apothecary

[Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) (lawful evil, human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is a black-robed Mage of High Sorcery. Though supposedly retired, she keeps a shop that deals in wares few in Kalaman need. [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md)'s Apothecary sells the occasional good-luck charm, but those who know what to ask for might gain access to the apothecary's back room, which houses esoteric spell components. The "Message for a Mage" section later in this chapter provides more details on [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) and her shop.

## Arriving in Kalaman

By dawn the morning after evacuating from Vogler, the characters and Vogler's surviving villagers arrive within sight of Kalaman. Read the following text when you're ready to start this part of the adventure:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walled city of Kalaman rises in the distance, spreading across the southern shore of a wide bay. Ships sail to and from the city's walled harbor, their courses lit by a pair of towering beacons.
> 
> On the shore ahead, where the Vingaard River meets Kalaman Bay, dozens of survivors from Vogler have pulled their mismatched boats ashore and begun making camp.
^17d

The characters are among the last to arrive from Vogler, likely accompanied by [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) and other allies. When they reach the survivors' camp, they find villagers organizing to assess their numbers, reunite separated families, and build fires to prepare meals.

### Refugees at the Shore

As the survivors of Vogler pull their ships ashore, the reality of their situation sets in, and minor troubles begin confounding the refugees. Roll on the Survivor Camp Hardships table to determine what challenges the survivors need help with. After you've run as many of these encounters as you like, proceed with the "Darrett's Armor" section.

**Survivor Camp Hardships**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-shadow-of-war.md#^survivor-camp-hardships)`

| dice: d4 | Situation |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Youngsters struggle to land their boat. The boat is 20 feet from the shore and drifting away. A character who swims to the boat can pilot it in by succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. |
| 2 | An older refugee slipped in the shallow water and sprained an ankle. A character can provide relief by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check, expending one use of a healer's kit, or using any magic that restores hit points. |
| 3 | A couple sits shivering beside an unlit stack of firewood, staring off in the direction of Vogler. Lighting the fire through any means calms the couple and earns a wordless nod of thanks. |
| 4 | Two rowdy youths take advantage of the chaos to try to rob a disliked neighbor. A character can stop them with a successful DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. |
^survivor-camp-hardships

### Darrett's Armor

If the characters collected the box [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md) asked them to fetch from Thornwall Keep in chapter 3, they can present it to [Darrett Highwater](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/darrett-highwater-dsotdq.md) after escaping Vogler.

Inside the box is a suit of plate armor filigreed with Solamnic knotwork, perfectly sized for Darrett's use. There's no note or any other instructions with the armor. If the characters explain Becklin asked them to give it to him, Darrett's touched and thanks the characters profusely.

From this point on, Darrett wears his Solamnic armor often and does his best to comport himself as he believes Becklin would have. If a character is affiliated with the Knights of Solamnia, he strives to emulate their virtuous deeds and might even adopt them as a mentor.

### Delegation to Kalaman

Soon after arriving on shore, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score realizes two prominent villagers are missing: Lord Bakaris and his son, [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md). If the characters ask around, a villager who reached the shore before them mentions that Lord Bakaris and his son headed to Kalaman hours ago, intent on addressing the city's leaders, but no one's heard back from them since. If the characters don't head to Kalaman to investigate, Mayor Raven asks them and Darrett to do so, giving them authority to make whatever arrangements are necessary to secure the safety of Vogler's people.

### Entrance to Kalaman

The trek from the villagers' landing spot to Kalaman spans two miles. As the characters and Darrett approach the city, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Statues of titanic soldiers line Kalaman's mighty walls. These ancient stone knights stare into the distance, daring invaders to dash themselves against defenses that withstood even the Cataclysm. A disorganized neighborhood of tents and ramshackle structures lines the road to the city's nearest gate, where soldiers in blue-and-yellow uniforms question all who enter.
^182

The gate guards halt the characters and ask their business, but admit them to the city as long as the characters aren't hostile. If a character asks about Lord Bakaris or a representative from the Vogler refugees, the guards point the way toward Castle Kalaman. The guards recall their captain leading a man matching Bakaris's description to the castle some time ago. Castle Kalaman is a towering structure and easy to find without directions, and the guards can also direct the characters to any site in the "Kalaman Locations" section.

## Castle Kalaman

When the characters and Darrett arrive at Castle Kalaman, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Even if the imposing Castle Kalaman didn't stand atop hundred-foot cliffs, it would still tower over every other structure in the city. The path to it rises up the cliffside, overlooked by gigantic statues matching those that line the city's walls. At the path's end, guards stand before an open gate.
^184

The guards at Castle Kalaman ask the characters to state their business. If the characters explain that they're representatives of Vogler's people, a guard leads them across a courtyard toward a council chamber where Lord Bakaris is speaking with the city council.

### Encounter with Bakaris

While the characters are making their way to the council chamber, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you cross Castle Kalaman's paved courtyard, a familiar figure intercepts you with an arrogant smile—[Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md).
> 
> "My father has matters well in hand. We'll be sure to send for you and the rest of the fish-folk once we've determined what's best for them."
^186

[Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) halts the group. He insists the characters shouldn't be allowed to disturb his father's audience with Kalaman's leaders.

Establish [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) not just as a bully, but as a threat to people in need. He and his father are putting their own ambitions before the needs of the people of Vogler—a trend that continues for the rest of this adventure. A character can make [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) step aside through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check. Alternatively, a character convinces the guard they're with to ignore Bakaris by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Afterward, Bakaris hurls weak insults and slinks off.

### Council Meeting

When the group arrives at the council chamber, the guard escorts the characters inside and explains who they are. After this, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Eight serious-looking people sit around a broad table in the middle of a spacious hall. At the table's end, a tall man with plaited blond hair and a velvet vest of blue and gold stands to greet you.
> 
> "Welcome, guests. I'm Governor Calof Miat. Your leader has briefed us on the situation in Vogler, his bold defense, and his eagerness to strike back against these invaders." As Miat says this, he nods to a man near him—Lord Bakaris, who glares at your intrusion.
> 
> "Tell us," the governor continues, "are your people still preparing for battle?"
^188

Along with Lord Bakaris and Governor Miat, the meeting includes guild leaders and Marshal Vendri (detailed in the "Kalaman Gazetteer" section).

It's clear from the governor's words and Lord Bakaris's expression that Bakaris is trying to advance his own agenda. Lord Bakaris told the council the villagers are taking up arms to retake their home. The characters know this isn't the case, though. Mayor Raven is focused on ensuring the villagers have food, security, and support in the days to come. And the characters are certain the refugees didn't appoint Lord Bakaris their leader.

![Lord Bakaris Uth Estide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/056-04-002.bakaris.webp#center)

#### Lord Bakaris Uth Estide

Lord [Bakaris Uth Estide](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-uth-estide-dsotdq.md) (neutral evil, human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) is an arrogant man with a lesser title among the Solamnic nobility. In ages past, his family was known for its wealth and generations of membership in the Knights of Solamnia. While Lord Bakaris retains a considerable amount of wealth, he has lived his entire life on stories of honor and great deeds, none of which are his own. Now Lord Bakaris sees the situation in Kalaman as his chance to win glory for himself. At heart, he's comically cowardly, full of bluster and inflated words. He has neither the spine to stand up to opposition nor the experience to lead.

##### Personality Trait

"I was born for greatness, and I'll take what I deserve."

##### Ideal

"My brilliance and worthiness are clear to everyone intelligent enough to deserve my time."

##### Bond

"My deeds will be the grandest chapter in the Estide family legend."

##### Flaw

"My blood makes me a leader. If commoners can do it, how hard can it be?"

#### Retaking Vogler

During the conversation with Kalaman's leaders, the characters might ask about retaking Vogler. Lord Bakaris is eager to do this, while Darrett prioritizes ensuring the villagers' safety. For the time being, the city council is more interested in gaining information about the enemy than running headlong into battle. If necessary, use Darrett to temper characters' desire for immediate revenge.

#### Clarifying the Situation

It's up to the characters to correct Bakaris's misinformation. Kalaman's council listens to what the characters say, asking probing questions until the truth of what happened in Vogler comes out. As the characters speak, Lord Bakaris contradicts them, trying to bolster his own fictitious position as the village leader who deserves accolades for bravely facing the Red Dragon Army. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check, a character can silence Lord Bakaris.

After the characters explain the current situation of those who escaped Vogler, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Governor Miat frowns. "This is all dire news. My heart goes out to your friends and families, but I hope you can understand our reticence to welcome you all through our city's gates. These aren't normal times. Marshal?"
> 
> The governor gestures to a stern woman wearing armor embellished with the blue and gold colors of Kalaman. She nods and begins, "I am Marshal Vendri, commander of Kalaman's military forces. I'm afraid your situation is far from unique."
^190

#### Kalaman's Concerns

Marshal Vendri goes on to explain that Vogler isn't the only community in the region to face peril. She shares the following details:

- Small villages and farms to the south and east of Kalaman have been burned in recent weeks.  
- Vogler is the largest community to be attacked and the only one with many survivors.  
- Experienced patrols of armored Kalaman soldiers have been found cut down, in some cases with mysterious clawlike gashes in their armor.  
- Lord Bakaris and the characters have provided the clearest information on the enemy that Kalaman has received to date.  

Marshal Vendri knows nothing of draconians, the Dragon Queen, or the Dragon Army. Her experience is considerable, but it involves battling raiders from Estwilde and ogres from the Taman Busuk. Everyone here has heard rumors of war in the eastern nation of Khur, but until now, they hadn't considered that far-off nation's struggles relevant.

Marshal Vendri is eager to hear anything the characters know about the enemy. She's even more impressed if the characters have physical evidence of draconians or Dragon Army soldiers.

Once the characters have heard the marshal's report, the governor asks the characters and Darrett to step outside while the council discusses what they've learned. Lord Bakaris isn't asked to leave.

#### Awaiting a Decision

Darrett and the characters are ushered into the hall outside the council chamber. Use this opportunity to have Darrett reemphasize how important it is for Vogler's people to have Kalaman's support and protection. A character who listens at the council chamber door and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears a frustrated Marshal Vendri repeatedly interrupt Lord Bakaris.

#### Kalaman's Decision

After half an hour, the council meeting adjourns. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The chamber's doors open, and most of the council members file past you without a glance. Marshal Vendri beckons to you from the door, while inside, Governor Miat and Lord Bakaris remain seated.
^194

When the characters reenter the council chamber, the governor bids them sit. After they're settled, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In a decisive tone, Governor Miat says, "The citizens of Kalaman are prepared to offer your people shelter in the neighborhoods outside the city walls, the protection of our soldiers, and—while we can spare it—food from our tables." He folds his hands and fixes his eyes on you. "There is a condition, though."
^195

Governor Miat explains the following points:

- Kalaman's leaders are concerned about the threat posed by the enemy that attacked Vogler.  
- The city has woefully little information about this foe, and the scouts sent to learn more have all disappeared.  
- The characters, however, both faced this foe and saved an entire village from its attack.  
- In return for Kalaman protecting the people of Vogler, Kalaman's leaders want the characters and Darrett to report to Marshal Vendri as special operatives in the Kalaman military.  

Let the characters discuss this offer. Marshal Vendri provides the following clarifications as needed:

- Only one of the characters needs to swear themself to serve Kalaman's military—though all are welcome—and only until the threat to the region is over.  
- Sworn characters will become esquires of Kalaman and be paid 5 gp per week.  
- Sworn characters and their companions will receive free lodging at Castle Kalaman.  
- Sworn characters will be given a palm-sized emblem with the blue-and-gold symbol of Kalaman etched into its face. This is a symbol of their special rank, which is akin to a lieutenancy (higher than soldiers but lower than commanders).  

If the characters refuse, Darrett asks to speak with them for a moment. He plans to accept the governor's terms and attempts to convince the characters to join him. He wants their aid not only to protect his people, but to counter the terrifying threat of the Dragon Army. If the characters still resist, Darrett suggests the characters could work for him as aides rather than working directly for the military—a proposal Kalaman's leaders are willing to accept.

If the characters and Darrett accept, Governor Miat is pleased and orders that Vogler's people be provided with food and supplies. Marshal Vendri dispatches guards to help the refugees relocate to lodgings outside the Trade Gate.

With that, the meeting with Kalaman's leaders concludes. Marshal Vendri asks Darrett and the characters to come to her office on the second floor of Castle Kalaman when they're ready to learn more about their position and their first duties. Until then, they should ensure their people are safe and familiarize themselves with the city.

### Reporting Back

When the characters return to where Vogler's survivors are camped, Mayor Raven meets them. If the characters gained the city's support, she thanks them profusely. If they didn't, she's eager to brainstorm ways to do so.

After hearing that Darrett—and likely some of the characters—agreed to aid Kalaman's military, Raven says she and the survivors of Vogler's militia intend to offer their assistance as well. She also asks the characters to stop calling her mayor—so long as Vogler is in Dragon Army hands, she's just Raven.

Lord Bakaris and his son don't return to the camp, instead paying for rooms at the Steady Beacon.

#### Reinforcements

A couple hours later, several wagons and a contingent of soldiers from Kalaman reach the survivors' camp with food and supplies. They aid the people most in need first, eventually assisting everyone in relocating to an unoccupied group of simple wooden buildings north of Kalaman's Trade Gate. The survivors find dry, safe housing and pitch in to make everyone's lodgings more comfortable. They also establish a communal cookhouse and infirmary.

Encourage the characters to use skills like Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) or any artisan's tools they might have to support Vogler's people and make their accommodations more welcoming. If they wish, the characters can also find bunks here for the evening, but staying at Castle Kalaman would be more comfortable—and free up more space and resources for the other evacuees. Once the characters see to the safety of Vogler's survivors, they're free to explore Kalaman as they please.

## Message for a Mage

If a character has a scroll to deliver to [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md), the Mage of High Sorcery (see the "Eye in the Sky" section in chapter 2), they can find her at [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md)'s Apothecary. If no characters are interested in joining the Mages of High Sorcery, skip this section.

The characters can easily find [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md)'s Apothecary. Foggy windows obscure a selection of charms and occult trappings for sale. The shop is open only during the day. If the characters enter during business hours, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md)'s Apothecary smells of licorice and pepper. The modest shop has a few meager tables displaying good-luck charms, odd animal bones, and vials advertising various remedies. At the rear of the shop, a human woman with raven hair and a dark dress with feathered, winglike sleeves stands behind a counter heaped with open books. She looks up from her reading, eyes you with disinterest, then goes back to her book.
^199

The shopkeeper here is [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) (lawful evil, human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)), a black-robed Mage of High Sorcery. Although self-interested and disdainful of non-mages, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) is a dedicated member of her organization.

If a character interested in joining the Mages of High Sorcery introduces themself, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) asks if they have a scroll for her. If the character delivers the scroll, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) immediately opens it.

### A Test Completed

Delivering the scroll to [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) is part of a test informing her which robed order of the Mages of High Sorcery might be a good fit for the character. After receiving the scroll, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) magically knows the alignment of the character tasked with delivering it—and whether they opened the scroll. The Scroll Predictions table determines which robed order [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) predicts the deliverer will join, based on the character's alignment and whether they opened the scroll before delivering it.

Don't share this with the character immediately—[Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md)'s estimation comes up later in their conversation with her.

**Scroll Predictions**

| Alignment | Opened Scroll | Didn't Open Scroll |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| Good | Red robes | White robes |
| Neutral | Red robes | Red robes |
| Evil | Black robes | Red robes |
^scroll-predictions

#### Wyhan's Recommendation

[Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) is skeptical of any character who expresses an interest in joining the Mages of High Sorcery. She asks them the following questions:

![Wyhan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/057-04-003.wyhan.webp#center)

- Why do you think you're worthy of using magic?  
- Do you serve your magic, or does your magic serve you?  
- How will you change the world with your magic?  
- If you were to lose your magic, what would you do?  

Regardless of the character's answers, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) responds with pragmatic criticism. Have her engage spellcasting characters in a philosophical conversation about the role of magic for as long as you want. Afterward, [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) does the following:

- She recommends which order of the Mages of High Sorcery she thinks the character is suited to (revealing her prediction from the previous section).  
- She agrees to contact her fellow Mages of High Sorcery and petition for the character's inclusion in the organization.  
- She promises to contact the characters when she hears back from the Mages' leaders at the Tower of High Sorcery in Wayreth.  
- She agrees to aid the character in obtaining transport to Wayreth so they can undertake the Test of High Sorcery (detailed in the "Mages of High Sorcery" section of chapter 1).  

[Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) is willing to answer a couple more questions about the Mages of High Sorcery, but after that, she insists the characters buy something or get out.

Any character interested in joining the Mages of High Sorcery hears back from [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) regarding their Test of High Sorcery at the beginning of the next chapter.

## Reporting for Duty

Once the characters are ready to begin work with Kalaman's military, they can report to Castle Kalaman. If they look for Darrett among the other Vogler survivors, he's nowhere to be found, as he has already reported to the castle.

When the characters arrive at Castle Kalaman, any guard can direct them to Marshal Vendri's office on the second floor (see "Within the Castle" for more information on the castle's layout). When the characters arrive at Vendri's office, an aide has them wait a few moments, then escorts them inside. Read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Marshal Vendri's office is spare. It holds little more than a desk heaped with documents, shelves filled with rolled scrolls, and a board on which is pinned a map of the surrounding province of Nightlund. Vendri stands as you enter. "Thank you for coming. I won't mince words: we're in the dark regarding the dangers I fear are fast approaching our gates, and your role will be to change that. But first, you must have questions."
^19d

Vendri patiently answers any questions about Kalaman, the city's military, and the characters' duties. Along with the details previously noted in the "Kalaman's Decision" section, Vendri shares the following particulars:

- The characters are expected to serve as a specialized squad dedicated to meeting challenges other troops can't address.  
- Each week's military salary is paid in advance. Characters who agreed to join can pick up their first payment of 5 gp from Vendri's clerk today.  
- Characters in need of equipment can freely take any mundane weapons, light armor, or medium armor they please from the armory on the castle's first floor.  
- Several people from Vogler have offered to lend Vendri their aid. She's currently determining how best to use these enthusiastic conscripts.  
- Vendri is still working out the details of the characters' first assignment. In the meantime, they should familiarize themselves with the castle and their lodgings on the fourth floor.  
- She doesn't bring up Darrett or his role. If the characters ask about him, she smiles and says she'll let him tell them himself shortly (see the "Darrett's Orders" section).  

### Within the Castle

Once the conversation with Marshal Vendri is complete, a guard guides the characters to the fourth floor while sharing details about the castle. Built centuries ago, the castle was long used by the Knights of Solamnia. Many of its large halls are decorated with images of Solamnic knights and the gods and animals they honored. The guard goes on to describe the castle's layout as follows:

- **First Floor.** The city council and governor meet and hold events on the first floor. Various government offices, a small library, and the armory are also here.  
- **Second Floor.** Military command and officer lodgings fill the second floor.  
- **Third Floor.** Castle guards lodge on the third floor. Most other soldiers reside elsewhere in the city or in the castle's ancillary structures.  
- **Fourth Floor and Towers.** Much of the castle is vacant and in disrepair, including most of the fourth floor and towers. The characters have been assigned lodgings in an unused ballroom on the fourth floor.  
- **Basement.** The basement is used for storage, though it also holds long-sealed doors to the castle's ruined dungeons.  

### Castle Lodgings

When the characters reach their lodgings, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room was once a small ballroom. A row of pillars, sculpted with knotwork and images of knights, supports a vaulted ceiling. Light shines into the room through tall windows facing the mountains to the south. One corner of the hall holds a collection of plain cots and empty chests, and nearby stands a large wooden table.
^1a0

Each character has a cot and an empty chest assigned to them. Three small private rooms connect to this hall, which the characters may use as they please.

#### Solamnic Statuary

Throughout Castle Kalaman, including within the characters' chambers, stonework and statues depict the warrior-god Kiri-Jolith, patron of the Solamnic Knights of the Sword. Clerics of Kiri-Jolith recognize these depictions, as do characters who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check.

### Darrett's Orders

As the characters settle into their lodgings, Darrett enters. After greeting them warmly, he shares the following information:

- He spent much of the morning demonstrating his training to Marshal Vendri and her commanders.  
- Vendri was pleased and ordered him to work with her to train a new unit of Kalaman soldiers.  
- Vendri also assigned him to work with the characters. He's not their commander, but he'll serve as Vendri's envoy, delivering her orders to them—and if needed, he can advocate for the characters with Vendri and Kalaman's leaders.  
- He was given lodgings on the third floor among the castle's guards.  
- He thanks the characters for all they've done for him and Vogler. He hopes to continue to learn from and support them.  

Darrett answers any questions the characters have, but he doesn't know much about Kalaman or missions to come. He's earnest in his desire to help the characters and excited to be in a castle where Knights of Solamnia once walked. He's eager to learn from this experience and hopes it'll one day help him become a true Knight of Solamnia.

After this, the characters have the rest of the day to do as they please. They'll receive their first mission in the morning.

## The First Mission

The next morning, Darrett meets the characters and relays the following orders from Marshal Vendri:

- Kalaman's leadership is disturbed to hear about the dragon-like invention the Red Dragon Army deployed in Vogler. They want to know more about it.  
- Twelve miles south of Kalaman lives a gnome inventor named [Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md).  
- Vendri wants the characters to go to Rookledust's home and see if she knows anything about this device or similar ones.  
- Even if Rookledust knows nothing, Kalaman's forces would like to meet with her in the city to recruit her as an advisor.  
- Darrett won't be joining them on this mission.  

Darrett doesn't know much more than this, but he provides the characters with accurate directions to Rookledust's home.

### Journey down Esker Brook

The lands around Kalaman consist of open fields, rolling hills, and scattered woods. The map of the Kalaman region in appendix E illustrates this area.

To the south rise the Dargaard Mountains, constantly cloaked in dark clouds that often spread their gloom across the surrounding land. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check knows the Solamnic province of Nightlund, which encompasses both the Dargaard Mountains and Kalaman, is widely said to be a land of eternal twilight where the sun never shines. In reality, the area is gloomy and sees frequent drizzle, but hardly suffers from accursed darkness.

During the party's travels, roll on the Hinterlands Encounters table to see what sights they come across.

**Hinterlands Encounters**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-shadow-of-war.md#^hinterlands-encounters)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Light rain falls for an hour, and distant lightning is visible over the Dargaard Mountains. |
| 2 | A band of `2d4` [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) heads northwest, paying the characters no mind. The bandits have no interest in fighting; they're following rumors of well-paying mercenary work. |
| 3 | The characters see a small, burned farmhouse. A character who investigates and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check finds no evidence of visitors, but the fire clearly started on the roof. |
| 4 | A [kender skirmisher](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kender-skirmisher-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) named Trapspringer approaches and asks if the characters have seen any dragons. He's heard rumors about dragons near Kalaman but hasn't seen any. |
^hinterlands-encounters

### Rookledust's Workshop

As the characters come within sight of Rookledust's home, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> On a hill stands an unusual structure that resembles both a cottage and a metal fortress. The building bristles with steaming pipes and whirring devices, and it is currently under siege.
> 
> Amid clanging metal contraptions, goblins try to breach the structure, impeded by gadgets that spin, snap, and thrash in the yard. Every few moments, a gnome appears from an open clockface above the door and hucks a new clockwork calamity at the attackers while cackling and yelling insults.
^1a6

The home of the gnome [Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md) is under attack by ten [goblins](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and—standing well back from the chaos—their [hobgoblin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) leader. The goblinoids wear dark armor with a spiral symbol—the same colors and symbol of Takhisis commonly worn by Red Dragon Army troops.

Characters who move adjacent to a goblin expose themselves to the out-of-control clockwork devices. These devices are Small objects with AC 15, 8 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. On initiative count 0, roll on the Clockwork Chaos table for each character adjacent to a goblin to determine how the devices react to that character.

**Clockwork Chaos**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-shadow-of-war.md#^clockwork-chaos)`

| dice: d6 | Device Effect |
|----------|---------------|
| 1–2 | No devices threaten the character. |
| 3 | A contraption that looks like a big set of teeth tries to bite the character (+3 to hit, `1d6` bludgeoning damage on a hit). |
| 4 | A bundle of thrashing cords whips around the character, who must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the end of the character's next turn. |
| 5 | A device fires a dart filled with glowing green fluid at the character (+4 to hit, 1 piercing damage on a hit). On a hit, the fluid is injected with an ominous hiss—but it proves harmless. |
| 6 | A mechanical chicken fires tin eggs at the character (+4 to hit, `1d4` bludgeoning damage on a hit). On a hit, the egg bursts in an oily mess, and the character has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the character's next turn. |
^clockwork-chaos

![The inventor Tatina Rookle...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/058-04-004.tatina-defense.webp#center "The inventor Tatina Rookledust defends her home from Dragon Army goblins")

The goblins flee after half their number are defeated. The hobgoblin tries to make the goblins hold their ground but also flees if he finds himself outnumbered by the characters.

#### Taken Alive

If the characters capture and interrogate one of the goblinoids, a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check learns the following:

- The goblinoids are members of the Red Dragon Army.  
- Their commander sent them here to get a weapon.  
- They don't know much about their leaders—only that most are humans and they pay well. One is a woman whose eye glows like an ember.  
- The army is to the north, near a burned village. The goblins are supposed to take the weapon there.  

The village the goblinoids are referring to is Vogler, but they don't know its name.

### Meeting Rookledust

Once the characters defeat the goblinoids, the gnome—[Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md)—appears through an aperture above her workshop's door. She asks the characters who they are, what they want, and if they're with the Dragon Army. Once she's convinced the characters pose no threat, she comes outside and speaks with them while she cleans up the devices in her yard.

#### Tatina Rookledust

[Tatina Rookledust](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tatina-rookledust-dsotdq.md) (neutral good rock gnome) moved to Nightlund decades ago from the distant gnome homeland of Mount Nevermind. She uses the [acolyte](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) stat block, but the effects of her Spellcasting manifest from various tools and tiny devices she always carries with her. Rookledust talks rapidly and is always formulating new ideas for her next overdesigned contraption. Though many of her creations are dangerous, she doesn't build them with violence in mind. She's particularly interested in devices for long-distance communication and inventions that mechanize the work of farm animals.

##### Personality Trait

"The faster I talk, think, and invent, the faster I can improve my designs."

##### Ideal

"Not only can I make that, I can make it better!"

##### Bond

"Through invention, we make a more interesting world."

##### Flaw

"I can make it for ya! Who are you again?"

#### Talking with Rookledust

Rookledust is eager to speak with the characters once she knows they're not affiliated with the Dragon Army. Use the following topics to guide the conversation with Rookledust:

- Rookledust is an inventor. She lives in seclusion so as not to disturb her neighbors with her experiments.  
- Several weeks ago, a stranger in red-and-black armor asked to purchase her weed-clearing device, but with some modifications to make it resemble a mythical dragon. She agreed. (Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a Dragon Army agent and the device was the boilerdrak used in Vogler.)  
- The stranger also hired her to design another device, which he was supposed to pick up today. Instead, the goblinoids showed up and demanded she turn over "the weapons."  
- Realizing the stranger was using her devices for malign reasons, she refused to hand over her inventions. The goblinoids then attacked.  
- She's happy to come with the characters to Kalaman and insists on giving them her newest invention (see "The Fargab").  

Rookledust regrets her weed-clearing device was misused, but she doesn't dwell on the past. She's ready to leave with the characters whenever they want to go; she just needs to grab her invention.

#### The Fargab

Rookledust calls her newest invention the "[fargab](Mechanics/items/fargab-dsotdq.md)" (see appendix A). She was supposed to design a new weapon for the Red Dragon Army, but she got distracted and instead created this long-distance communication device. She currently has one paired set of fargabs, which she gives to the characters—and, by extension, Kalaman's defenders.

### Back to Kalaman

After giving the characters the fargabs, Rookledust accompanies them to Kalaman. The journey back to the city is uneventful.

The city leaders welcome Rookledust as their guest and give her comfortable lodgings. In the coming days, she advises them on what little she knows about the Dragon Army and spouts ideas for inventions to aid Kalaman.

## Missions for Kalaman

In the days following the characters' arrival in Kalaman, war looms ever closer. The missions in this section represent the growing threat to the region. Use some or all of these missions in any order you please, with as much time between missions as you wish. After you've established the Red Dragon Army's threat, continue with the "Wheelwatch Outpost" section.

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn Interludes
> 
> If you are using the *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn* board game alongside this adventure, consider running scenarios 2 and 3 during the "Missions" section of the adventure. These scenarios are optional, but they provide further insight into what Kalaman's troops are doing to combat the Dragon Army threat.
^warriors-of-krynn-interludes

### Clarifying the Threat

As the characters complete these assignments, it becomes clear the Dragon Army is more than a group of raiders. Gradually reinforce the following facts:

- **Dangerous Recruits.** Bandits and mercenaries have been coming to the region to join the Dragon Army. It's said the Dragon Army pays well.  
- **Draconians.** Dragon Army forces include bipedal creatures with dragon-like features. Dragon Army soldiers refer to these creatures as draconians.  
- **Enemy Armor.** Dragon Army troops wear black armor with red flourishes and the symbol of Takhisis the Dragon Queen.  
- **The Highmaster.** The Red Dragon Army leader is Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md). Her soldiers fear her and claim she can see through lies.  

Additionally, if the characters capture a prisoner and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, they learn one of the following pieces of information:

- **Dread Servants.** Draconians serve the Dragon Queen fanatically and fearlessly.  
- **Flying Steeds.** The Dragon Army uses wyverns and dragonkin called dragonnels as flying steeds.  
- **Magical Threats.** Some draconians can cast spells, control the minds of others, steal the form of foes they've killed, or even explode when they die.  

### Missions

Through Darrett, the leaders of Kalaman might send the characters on the following missions. Use the random encounter table in appendix B if you'd like to add more encounters with the Dragon Army.

#### Ambushing the Enemy

The characters are tasked with investigating a farmstead eighteen miles east of the city, after fleeing residents report the farm was overrun by soldiers. When the characters arrive, they find the farm ransacked and a [Dragon Army soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) training six [hobgoblin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hobgoblin.md) mercenaries. The Dragon Army soldier orders the hobgoblins to attack, telling them, "Here's your final test. Dispatch these fools and earn your place in the Dragon Army!" The hobgoblins fight until their commanding Dragon Army soldier is killed or half their number are wiped out.

##### Treasure

The soldiers' gear includes 200 gp and five suits of black [chain mail](Mechanics/items/chain-mail.md) emblazoned with the symbol of Takhisis. The Dragon Army soldier also carries the following message:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Highmaster requires soldiers, not thugs. Figure out which you have, then dispatch the ones not suited to the task. This is the Dragon Queen's will.
^1b7

#### Draconian Blockade

Word reaches Kalaman of soldiers attacking travelers on the roads leading toward farmlands near the Estwilde border. The characters are ordered to follow the road east and see what they find.

Twenty miles east of Kalaman, where the road crosses the Raiding Rill, the characters find two empty, toppled wagons. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) finds clawed footprints leading to woods to the south. If the characters follow the path, they come on a camp of five [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) led by a [bozak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bozak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks). The draconians fight to the death.

##### Treasure

The draconians have stolen 120 gp, food equivalent to 60 days of rations, and a [driftglobe](Mechanics/items/driftglobe.md).

#### Missing Scouts

The characters are sent to track down a pair of scouts keeping tabs on Dragon Army movements north of the Vingaard River, twenty miles northwest of Kalaman and six miles east of Vogler. The characters are told to find the scouts' lookout post in a stand of gray birch, trees uncommon in the area.

Once the characters arrive in the area, they find the lookout post in fifteen minutes if a character succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check; otherwise, finding the post takes three hours. Regardless of when the characters arrive, they find one [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) tied to a tree in the center of the camp, being harassed by two [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B); the other scout lies dead nearby. A [kapak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) hides in the trees above the camp and tries to ambush the characters after combat begins.

##### Development

If the scout is freed, they report that the Dragon Army has split its forces to attack communities across Hinterlund and Nightlund. The army seems intent on isolating Kalaman from the Solamnic cities of Maelgoth and Palanthas in the west. The scout asks the party to help them return safely to Kalaman with this report. If the characters do so, Kalaman's leaders are pleased and reward them with a bonus of 100 gp each.

#### Troops Return

While the characters are completing another mission, they catch sight of a small group of armed soldiers marching toward Kalaman. These soldiers are at least a mile away and don't bear the colors of either Kalaman or the Dragon Army. If the characters draw closer, it's clear the soldiers are exhausted and have recently seen battle. If the soldiers spot the characters, their leader calls a halt and approaches the characters. Characters quickly recognize [Cudgel Ironsmile](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/cudgel-ironsmile-dsotdq.md) (introduced in chapter 3).

##### Reuniting with Cudgel

Cudgel is delighted to see the characters survived the evacuation of Vogler. She explains she and the troops here are all that remains of her mercenary company, the Ironclad Regiment, after they engaged the Dragon Army outside Vogler. Since their defeat, they've taken a winding route to avoid the enemy as they make their way to Kalaman. Cudgel seeks to rest and find work in the city. If it comes up that the characters are working for Kalaman's military, she asks the characters to introduce her to Marshal Vendri. Even if the characters don't make this introduction, in the coming days, Cudgel allies herself and her remaining troops with Kalaman's military.

##### Other Survivors

At your discretion, other folk from Vogler who were lost during the Dragon Army's attack, like Becklin (see the "Lost in Battle" section in chapter 3), could also return with Cudgel's group.

### Character Advancement

After completing this section—and before proceeding with the "Wheelwatch Outpost" section—the characters advance to 5th level.

## Wheelwatch Outpost

Wheelwatch, Kalaman's southernmost outpost, has been taken by Red Dragon Army forces. Darrett requests the characters participate in retaking it. Start this section only after you've run any desired events in the "Missions for Kalaman" section.

### Preparing for the Mission

Darrett brings the characters word that the Dragon Army has taken one of Kalaman's border forts. He has the following information:

- Wheelwatch Outpost stands near the border with the land of Estwilde. The fort supplies Kalaman's forces that patrol the border.  
- The fort, which lies twenty-four miles southeast of the city, has been taken by the Dragon Army.  
- Raven has been aiding Kalaman's military. She was given command of a force to retake the outpost, but that force is small and inexperienced.  
- Darrett asks the characters to join Raven and support her in retaking the fort.  

Darrett arranges a meeting between the characters and Raven later that day. During the meeting, Raven provides a sketch of Wheelwatch Outpost featuring the information on map 4.2. Raven also informs the characters of the following:

- The fort's tall northwest tower is a watchtower with a commanding view of the surrounding land.  
- All four corner fortifications are equipped with horns that sentries use to raise an alarm.  
- Raven doesn't know how many Dragon Army soldiers occupy the fort.  
- After Raven and her troops leave Kalaman, it will take them eight hours to get in position in a secluded grove a mile from the fort.  

Raven suggests the characters slip into the fort and open a gate without raising the alarm. However, she's amenable to any plan that doesn't risk the lives of her troops or destroy the fort.

#### Reconnaissance

Wheelwatch Outpost lies south of where the streams known as the Gravel Run and the Raiding Rill meet. Read the following description when the characters come within sight of the fort:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the distance, a squat stone fortress rises from one of the last patches of green before the rocky scrubland of Estwilde. Its tall wooden gates are flanked by crenelated battlements and solid watchtowers. Torchlight shines through the fort's windows, and every so often, armored figures make their way along the walls.
^1c3

If a character spends eight hours observing the fort, they determine that patrols in the corner towers switch watch duty every six hours, and they can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to estimate how many Dragon Army soldiers are in the fort. On a successful check, the character accurately estimates about twenty Dragon Army soldiers are in the fort. On a failed check, they estimate double this number. If the check fails by 10 or more, the character is spotted, and after 10 minutes, a squad of six [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) leaves the fort to investigate the character's position. If the soldiers find the character or don't return, the fort goes on alert (see the "Wheelwatch Alert" section).

### Wheelwatch Alert

The Dragon Army troops occupying Wheelwatch Outpost are on the lookout for danger. Use the following details to guide when the Dragon Army soldiers go on alert and how that affects their behavior.

#### Alarm Horns

Each of the outpost's corner guard posts (areas W2, W3, and W4) is equipped with an alarm horn. If a sentry in one of these areas notices enemies or unusual activity, they attempt to sound an alarm horn 1 round later on their turn. Once an alarm horn is sounded, the fort goes on alert.

#### Alert

If a threat is detected, the eight [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) in area W5 rush to meet it (or gather in area W1 if the source is unclear). While on alert, Dragon Army troops have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. Troops remain on alert for twelve hours after spotting an enemy or finding other clear signs of enemy activity. In the case of other threats, troops remain on alert until the danger passes or is identified as a false alarm.

#### Impostors

Characters who wear Dragon Army armor have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks made to pass as Dragon Army soldiers.

#### Dragonnel Rider

The Dragon Army has a secret weapon in area W8: a [Dragon Army dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) and its [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) rider (see appendix B for both stat blocks). If the characters don't discover the pair first, the dragonnel and its rider take to the air and attack at a dramatic moment—likely after the characters have overcome most of the fort's forces or as they work to open the gates in area W1.

### Wheelwatch Features

Wheelwatch Outpost has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in the outpost's interior chambers are 10 feet high.  
- **Gates.** The outpost's 15-foot-tall, reinforced wooden gates can be opened or closed only by the gate controls nearest them (see area W1 for a description of these controls). Each gate door is a Huge object with AC 17, 80 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Light.** Torches provide bright light throughout the fort, except for area W5, which is dimly lit.  
- **Walls.** The walls of Wheelwatch are 20 feet high, with towers and fortifications adding an additional 10 feet for each floor. A character can climb the walls by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The windows in these walls are 6-inch-wide arrow slits.  

### Wheelwatch Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.2: Wheelhouse Outpost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/059-map-4.02-wheelhouse-outpost.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/060-map-4.02-wheelhouse-outpost-player.webp#gallery)

#### W1: Courtyard

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The fort's courtyard holds several small structures with wooden roofs. Stairs climb from the dirt yard to the fort's west and east battlements. To the north and south stand solid wooden gates reinforced with iron bands. Along the wall next to each gate is a metal mechanism with a prominent winch.
^1cc

At any given time, three [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) are in the courtyard patrolling, training, or running errands.

##### Gate Controls

The north and south gates each have a mechanism to open and close that gate. Unlocking a gate mechanism requires using one of the outpost's three gate keys or succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Once unlocked, the winch on the controls moves freely. It takes 1 minute to fully open or close the gates using the controls. Opening a gate attracts the attention of all creatures in areas W1, W2, W3, and W4.

#### W2: South Guard Towers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two soldiers stand at this stone room's narrow windows. A horn hangs on the wall between the doors.
^1cf

The south guard towers are identical. In each, two [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) watch the surrounding land.

#### W3: Northwest Guard Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Narrow windows line the walls of this bare stone room. In the southeast corner, a ladder climbs to the floor above. On the wall next to it hangs a metal horn.
^1d1

The northwest tower is the largest of Wheelwatch's guard towers. Its second floor is identical to the first, accessed by the ladder here.

On the first floor, a [sivak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sivak-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) stands guard in human guise. It's using its Shape Theft reaction to take the form of a Kalaman soldier it killed. If slain, it shifts back to its true form.

Two [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) guard the second floor. Their alarm horn hangs on the south wall by the ladder.

#### W4: Northeast Fortification

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A U-shaped hall lined with narrow windows runs around this fortification. Along a wall bearing racks of weapons and a horn hanging from a leather strap, doors lead into an interior room.
^1d3

Two [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) keep watch in the hall here. Their alarm horn hangs from the north weapon rack. If battle breaks out here, the Dragon Army soldiers in area W5 come to investigate after 2 rounds.

##### Treasure

The weapon racks hold dozens of weapons that belonged to Kalaman's forces before the fort was taken. One rack also has a [hoopak](Mechanics/items/hoopak-dsotdq.md) staff (see appendix A) taken from Elgo (who's imprisoned in area W6). Mounted over the south rack is a shiny lance etched with images of dragons; made of tin, this decoration is useless in combat.

#### W5: Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Soft lantern light dimly outlines six two-level sets of bunk beds filling this modest barracks. A footlocker sits beneath each set of bunks.
^1d6

At any given time, eight [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) rest here. They swap places with on-duty guards throughout the day. If they hear battle in area W4 or an alarm horn sounds, they rush to support their allies after 2 rounds.

- **Treasure.** Under each of the sets of bunks is a simple wooden footlocker. Each holds two sets of common clothes and 10 gp. One footlocker also contains a silvered [longsword](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), while another contains a [holy symbol](Mechanics/items/holy-symbol.md) of Takhisis and a key for the gate controls in area W1.  

#### W6: Prison

If the alarm hasn't been raised, a [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) named Ardlic Vanse is seated at a desk, writing a report. He commands the forces here. He is terrified of his commander, [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), and will sacrifice his life and the lives of his troops to keep control of the fort.

##### North Cell

This locked cell holds a neutral human [Kalaman soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) named Lanal Brint. He was sleeping off a night of drink in this cell when the outpost was taken. He tells the characters anything they want to know about the fortress—such as how the gate mechanisms work—but only after he's separated from Elgo (see below).

##### South Cell

This locked cell holds Elgo Duckditcher, a chaotic good [kender skirmisher](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kender-skirmisher-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) who considers herself a famous explorer and avoider of fowl. The Red Dragon Army imprisoned her here after she insisted she be allowed to explore the fort. In the days since, she has told Lanal every story she knows twice and has declared him her adopted cousin. She's convinced his name is Flannel, though, and she won't hear otherwise—she knows her own cousin's name. If freed, Elgo won't leave until she recovers her hoopak (found in area W4).

##### Treasure

The papers on the desk include Commander Vanse's daily reports, along with orders to hold Wheelwatch at all costs, signed "Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md)." A desk drawer holds [thieves' tools](Mechanics/items/thieves-tools.md) confiscated from Elgo and 200 gp.

Commander Vanse carries an iron ring with keys to the cells in this area and to the gates in area W1.

#### W7: Storage

The storage room's barrels contain enough food, water, and other supplies to sustain the outpost for a month. A character who spends 5 minutes searching the supplies and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a dusty case containing six [flasks of alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md).

#### W8: Stable

A character who listens at the door to the stable and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears something large moving inside.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Filled with stalls and supplies for horses, this stable stinks of large animals and blood. The ground is covered with the scattered skeletons of two horses. Looming over them, something large, red, and reptilian picks through their bones.
^1dd

A [Dragon Army dragonnel](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/dragon-army-dragonnel-dsotdq.md) and its rider, a [Dragon Army officer](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-officer-dsotdq.md), are in this stable (see appendix B for both stat blocks). If the characters enter, the dragonnel recognizes them as intruders and attacks. This is likely the first time the characters have seen a creature this similar to a dragon. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check knows the creature is a dragonnel, a wild lesser cousin of the storied dragons that disappeared from Krynn.

If the dragonnel and its rider already took flight (see "Wheelwatch Alert"), this area is empty.

#### W9: Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Cooking supplies fill this room. Opposite a table covered in cutlery and scrawny carrots, a human soldier wearing a stained apron over his armor minds two pots bubbling on a lit stove.
^1df

A [Dragon Army soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) prepares a meal here: a watery soup, heavy on pepper.

##### Treasure

The cook's prized possession is a pair of salt and pepper shakers worth 20 gp. They're lovingly carved to resemble black and white dragons.

### Completing the Mission

Once the characters open Wheelwatch's gates, Raven sends in her troops to clear out any remaining Dragon Army resistance. She suggests the characters rest and recuperate, then return to Kalaman with a letter from Raven informing Marshal Vendri of their victory.

Any Dragon Army soldier taken captive during the mission makes one of the following claims:

- **Futile Victory.** The Dragon Army is certain to retake Wheelwatch at any time. Kalaman's defenders should surrender now.  
- **Gathering Threat.** The Red Dragon Army's leader, Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), is still preparing her forces. Her troops will subdue the region before turning to greater conquests.  
- **Messenger.** The dragonnel stationed here was a mere messenger. When war truly comes to the region, red wings will darken the skies.  

## Battle at Steel Springs

The trip from Wheelwatch back to Kalaman is uneventful. On their return to Castle Kalaman, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices the castle is unusually quiet. When the characters report to Marshal Vendri's office, an aide informs them the marshal is away from Kalaman and shares the following facts:

- After the characters left Kalaman, the city council got word that a contingent of Dragon Army troops had broken away from the larger force.  
- Tired of measured steps, members of Kalaman's leadership—spurred by Lord Bakaris—demanded Kalaman's military ride out to seize a victory.  
- With Marshal Vendri away leading troops further west, Governor Miat approved the strike.  
- Lord Bakaris and his son are leading the attack. Darrett is serving under them.  
- They plan to ambush the Red Dragon Army near a crossing of the Inkwater called Steel Springs, thirty miles west of Kalaman.  

The aide knows nothing more, but before the characters leave, the aide discreetly slips them a sealed note signed by Darrett that reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Come at once. Bakaris is leading us to ruin at Steel Springs. He's the commander of this mission, and I can't disobey. I'll do what I can, but I need your help.
^1e3

If the characters seek out Governor Miat, he's busy conducting other business with the city's guild leaders and won't be available for hours. Even if the characters find him, he isn't a military leader, doesn't understand the characters' concern, and can do little now the troops have been sent.

### Flight to Steel Springs

Assuming the characters head to Steel Springs, they arrive as Kalaman's forces engage the Dragon Army. However, Kalaman received faulty intelligence, and its troops are badly outnumbered. Rather than joining the Kalaman forces in their advance, the characters find themselves defending a retreat.

The adventure unfolds in one of two ways:

- **With Mass Combat.** If you're using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game with this adventure, consult the "Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 4" sidebar.  
- **Without Mass Combat.** If you aren't using the Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn game, continue with the following section.  

> [!note] Warriors of Krynn: Scenario 4
> 
> The characters reach the battlefield as the conflict turns against Kalaman's forces. Read the introduction to scenario 4 in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*, then play that scenario. This scenario details the characters' attempt to organize a retreat from this losing battle.
> 
> If the characters attain a win or hold during this scenario, Kalaman's soldiers henceforth know them as the Saviors of Steel Springs, and each character has advantage on their next Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check made to influence a member of Kalaman's military. Characters gain no benefit for a loss.
> 
> When this scenario concludes, proceed with "The Lord's Arrival."
^warriors-of-krynn-scenario-4

### Retreat from Steel Springs

When the characters complete the thirty-mile trip to Steel Springs, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As the brook called the Inkwater comes into view, smoke rises over the tree line beyond it. Wounded Kalaman soldiers stagger from the trees, heading toward a narrow crossing that lies in your direction. Dragon Army soldiers give chase on horseback.
^1e7

This battlefield is represented on map 4.3. As the characters arrive, six [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B), each with 8 hit points, flee south from the battle occurring up the road. They've reached the islet at the center of the map. Four [Dragon Army soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) on [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) gallop in pursuit along the road at the north of the map.

The Dragon Army soldiers ride to the edge of the northern stream, throwing javelins at the retreating Kalaman soldiers. The Dragon Army soldiers shift their attention to the characters if attacked.

The Kalaman soldiers continue their retreat south instead of engaging. They move only 15 feet per round (see "Steel Springs Battlefield Events"), staying in a group and aiding the wounded among them.

After all enemy forces are defeated, proceed with the "Commanders' Retreat" section.

#### Steel Springs Battlefield Features

The battlefield includes the following features:

- **Rocks and Scrub.** Rocks and vegetation on the map are "difficult terrain".  
- **Stream.** The chilly stream is 4 feet deep and is "difficult terrain". The crossings aren't difficult terrain.  
- **Fray.** The 15-foot-wide area marked by the design at the edge of the map represents directions from which creatures from the nearby battle might arrive, as detailed in the following section.

#### Steel Springs Battlefield Events

During this encounter, as long as there are still Dragon Army soldiers on the battlefield, roll on the Steel Springs Battlefield Events table each round on initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table if a character enters the Fray or a Kalaman soldier is killed. After you roll on this table, the wounded Kalaman soldiers move 15 feet south along the road unless an event says otherwise.

**Steel Springs Battlefield Events**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-shadow-of-war.md#^steel-springs-battlefield-events)`

| dice: d8 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1–3 | One of the wounded [Kalaman soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) collapses. The soldier and other Kalaman soldiers within 10 feet of that soldier don't move this round. |
| 4–5 | Arrows arc over the trees to the north. A random player character and each creature within 10 feet of that character must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage. |
| 6 | Another wounded [Kalaman soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kalaman-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) with 8 hit points appears adjacent to the Fray nearest a random [Dragon Army soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md). This wounded soldier moves only 15 feet per round and tries to retreat south like the other Kalaman soldiers. |
| 7 | A dragonnel flies overhead, dropping a screaming Kalaman soldier next to a random player character as it does. The soldier dies on impact. This event is unsettling but has no other effect. |
| 8 | A hostile [Dragon Army soldier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/dragon-army-soldier-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) mounted on a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) appears in a space adjacent to the Fray nearest a random player character. This event occurs only once during the battle; reroll on this table if it is rolled again. |
^steel-springs-battlefield-events

### Commanders' Retreat

After the Dragon Army soldiers are dealt with, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dozen mounted soldiers gallop from the tree line, rushing south toward the crossing. Kalaman's colors are visible on these soldiers' armor, despite the dents and stains of battle. It's easy to pick out Darrett among these riders in his distinctive Solamnic armor. Another figure sits behind Darrett, sharing his steed.
^1eb

This group of twelve mounted Kalaman soldiers includes several commanders who drew off the Dragon Army forces so their allies could retreat farther to the east. Darrett rides with Lord Bakaris behind him, sharing his mount.

Darrett spots the characters and tells them the Dragon Army's forces overwhelmed Kalaman's troops and are in pursuit. He urges the characters to follow him to a fallback point to the east. If the characters seek to fight the Dragon Army, Darrett reinforces that hundreds of enemy soldiers are inbound and the wounded Kalaman troops need the characters' help. Lord Bakaris is clearly in a state of shock and doesn't speak during the conversation.

#### Safe for Now

Darrett leads the characters six miles east of Steel Springs, where Kalaman's soldiers have retreated to. Once there, Darrett explains the following details:

- Lord Bakaris ordered an assault on the Dragon Army forces, unaware of Dragon Army reinforcements nearby. The battle swiftly swung against Kalaman's forces.  
- Darrett and other commanders ordered a swift withdrawal, saving many lives.  
- In the retreat, forces commanded by [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) were overwhelmed. [Bakaris the Younger](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/bakaris-the-younger-dsotdq.md) is unaccounted for and believed dead.  
- Lord Bakaris is in a state of shock.  
- The Dragon Army doesn't seem to be pursuing the retreating troops.  
- Darrett has word that Marshal Vendri's forces are traveling from the west to protect the city.  

Darrett, the de facto leader of the retreating forces, lets the troops rest overnight. He suggests the characters rest along with them. The next morning, he encourages the characters to ride ahead to Kalaman to inform Governor Miat of what happened while the surviving troops rendezvous with Marshal Vendri on the way to Kalaman.

## The Lord's Arrival

This section presents a surprise attack on Kalaman's leadership and reveals a new threat hidden within the Dragon Army. Before the characters begin this section, make sure they're rested. There is no timeline for how the following events unfold, but encourage a sense of urgency; the characters are all that stand between Kalaman and tragedy.

### Returning to Kalaman

As the characters near the gates of Kalaman, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A crowd mills at the gate ahead, dozens of commoners murmuring and excitedly looking past the closed portcullis. "There's nothing to see!" shouts a guard, "Please move along."
^1ef

![Solamnic knights mysteriously arrive in Kalaman](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/063-04-005.solamnic-knights.webp#center)

The characters learn the following from a gate guard or anyone in the crowd:

- An hour ago, a retinue of Knights of Solamnia entered the city and headed to Castle Kalaman.  
- The knights aren't well-liked in Kalaman, but at this point, any allies are welcome.  
- The lead knight's name was Knight [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md). He was a charming man with a message for the governor.  
- Knight [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) entered with at least a dozen heavily armored knights, like something out of a story.  

While learning about the knights' arrival, a character can press a local for more details by making a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a successful check, the local says they were surprised by some of the knights' armor; it was tarnished in a way the Knights of Solamnia from old stories would surely have avoided.

When the characters identify themselves, the guards raise the gate's portcullis and admit them into the city.

#### Castle Kalaman's Visitors

The gates of Castle Kalaman are closed when the characters arrive, but the guards recognize the characters and admit them. The guards confirm a contingent of knights is meeting with the governor and the city councilors in the main council chamber, but a couple of the knights remained in the castle's courtyard if the characters wish to meet them.

Once the characters enter Castle Kalaman's courtyard, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Castle Kalaman's courtyard is largely deserted, as most of the city's defenders remain with the troops west of the city. Near the covered cloisters leading to the city council's conference rooms are two heavily armored Knights of Solamnia on horseback. One of them holds a banner bearing a prominent rose emblem.
^1f1

The two knights here are [Undead soldiers](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/undead-soldier-dsotdq.md). They use the [wight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wight.md) stat block with the following changes:

- They wear plate armor and have AC 18.  
- They don't have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait.  

The wights refuse to speak, and their armor and other clothing disguise their nature. Any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher notices the knights' armor is covered in spots of ash and rust, as if exceptionally old.

These Undead knights block the entrance to the castle. They attack anyone who tries to slip past or to remove part of a wight's disguise. After a wight takes 10 points of damage, its disguise is undermined, revealing the skeletal form below.

### Council Massacre

When the characters approach the council chamber, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you near the chamber where the governor and city council are meeting with the Knights of Solamnia, the halls are empty. The council chamber's door stands ajar, and its guard is absent. Though the room usually buzzes with conversation, everything is silent.
^1f3

In the council chamber, the characters find the following scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A scene of slaughter spills across the council chamber. Several guards wearing the colors of Kalaman soldiers lie tangled amid skeletal remains in tarnished Solamnic armor. The bloody bodies of Kalaman's council members slump in high-backed chairs and across the room's large table. At a position of honor opposite the door, Governor Calof Miat's body is transfixed to his chair, a gleaming longsword piercing his chest.
> 
> Next to the governor's body, a man in Solamnic armor rocks back in a chair. He props his booted feet on the table as he balances a scroll on one finger.
^1f4

The governor, all of Kalaman's council members, and six castle guards lie dead here. They are beyond the aid of a [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md) spell.

The man here is [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B), an Undead spirit who has been possessing a Knight of Solamnia (use the [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) stat block) for over a week. Charming but utterly amoral, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is Lord Loren Soth's seneschal. He served as the mouthpiece of [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and his Undead troops, gaining them access to Kalaman's rulers under the guise of being helpful Knights of Solamnia. During their audience with the city's rulers, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md), and their Undead knights murdered the city's leaders. Soth then went on to his actual objective in the catacombs beneath the castle, while [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) remained behind to prevent any interference.

#### Caradoc

[Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B) died during the Cataclysm alongside [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) over three hundred years ago. In life, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) gained his station among the Knights of Solamnia due to his noble pedigree and his family's money. Cowardly but charming, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) befriended and came to serve his fellow knight, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), often advising the bold knight about the subtleties of courtly intrigues. Soth made [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) his seneschal, and the knight serves him still.

When Soth rose as an Undead, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) was similarly cursed, returning to life as an incorporeal spirit. [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) can't leave the grounds of Dargaard Keep except within a body he has possessed. Now, he delights in jumping from body to body, using and disposing of the living as he pleases.

#### Caught in the Act

When [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) sees the characters, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Noticing you, the knight stands, clears his throat, and bombastically declares, "Hail, friends, and fear not—your heroes have arrived!
> 
> "I, Knight [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md), bring word that the Knights of Solamnia are, at this very moment, en route with all manner of pomp and mustache wax and whatever else they bother with these days." He gestures at the corpses about the room, "Do try to contain yourselves better than this lot did."
^1fb

[Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) delights in mocking the characters and disrespecting the dead. As he's buying time for [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) converses with the characters for as long as he can, sharing the following information:

- He's [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md), a Knight of Solamnia.  
- No, of course the Knights of Solamnia aren't actually coming, but saying so did allow him to get his lord's retinue through the city gates.  
- No, he won't say who his lord is.  
- No, he doesn't serve the Red Dragon Army—not quite. He serves his lord, and his lord serves a higher power.  
- His lord was here, but he had to go attend to business with a musty old friend.  

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recalls [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) was the name of an obscure knight of the Order of the Rose who died during the Cataclysm.

##### Blood Trail

While speaking with [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) or after defeating him, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices a blood trail leading to a small, shattered door at the rear of the room. Beyond it, a hall leads to the sealed staircase detailed in the "Path Below" section.

##### Fighting Caradoc

When the characters attack [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) or try to leave the room, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) pulls his sword from Governor Miat's corpse and attacks. He's reckless in battle and mocks the characters as they fight. Once his knight form is defeated, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) rises in his true incorporeal form. On the first round after emerging from the knight's body, he automatically succeeds on the saving throw his Bound Haunting trait requires him to make. He continues to attack the characters with his Possession and Withering Touch actions until he's destroyed or his Bound Haunting trait spirits him back to Dargaard Keep. Before vanishing, [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) promises the characters he'll see them again.

##### Lost Knight

If the knight [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) has been possessing drops to 0 hit points, allow the knight to make death saving throws, as the characters may wish to heal him. His name is [Durstan Rial](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/durstan-rial-dsotdq.md) (neutral, human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)), and he has little memory of the last few weeks since he was ambushed while traveling near the Dargaard Mountains. He helps the characters defeat [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) if the spirit is present, but he ultimately wishes to return to his home in Maelgoth.

##### Treasure

Once [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is defeated, a character can get a better look at the scroll he was holding. Its slightly scorched parchment is sealed by black wax with a rose emblem stamped into it. If they open the scroll, the characters see the following words burned into the page:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> People of Kalaman,
> 
> I exert my rightful claim as ruler of the province of Knightlund. Submit or flee.
> 
> Lord Loren Soth, Knight of the Rose
^200

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recalls the following information about [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md):

- **Knight and Ruler.** [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) was a Knight of Solamnia of the Order of the Rose. He ruled the province of Nightlund when it was known as Knightlund.  
- **Failed Redemption.** The gods gave Soth the opportunity to redeem himself and prevent the Cataclysm, but he didn't complete his quest, and the Cataclysm occurred.  
- **Tarnished Reputation.** Soth's failure contributed to the widespread distrust of the Knights of Solamnia.  
- **Cursed Castle.** Soth's fate is a mystery, but his home, Dargaard Keep, is known to be a cursed, haunted ruin.  

#### Leedara's Warning

Moments after [Caradoc](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/caradoc-dsotdq.md) is defeated, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) (detailed in chapter 3) appears. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The musician [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) steps forward from a corner of the chamber, though you could've sworn it was empty a moment ago. A look of urgency tightens her features. "You must hurry on," the elf says, pointing to a shattered door at the rear of the chamber. "There's a secret beneath this castle—one the old lord can't be allowed to possess."
^202

[Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) won't elaborate on her words or why she's present, insisting it might already be too late and the characters must hurry. At some point while the characters are all distracted or otherwise don't have her in their line of sight, [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) vanishes. If the characters later search for her in Kalaman, they don't find her.

#### Path Below

Beyond the broken door in the council chamber lies a narrow corridor used by servants. Several plain doors lead to other parts of the castle, but at the far end of the passage shines a faint violet light. Characters who seek out the light see the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A doorframe sculpted with somber knights stands in an alcove along this corridor. The doorframe was once sealed, but shattered bricks now lie scattered across the floor. Beyond the opening, a steep flight of stairs descends below ground. Violet light and the sound of crackling flames emanate from below.
^204

This passage descends into the catacombs beneath Castle Kalaman.

## Raided Catacombs

When the Knights of Solamnia held Castle Kalaman, the structure was more than a fortress—it was also a temple, beneath which fallen knights were entombed in a place of honor. During the Cataclysm, waves of divine wrath raged across the land. While the flames receded following the disaster, in a few cursed places this Cataclysmic fire remained. One such place is the catacombs containing the tomb of Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) beneath Castle Kalaman. The Knights of Solamnia locked these tombs away, and when others later took control of the castle, the catacombs were sealed entirely. Now [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) has come to these catacombs following the Dragon Queen's will.

### Knight Sarlamir's Curse

Among the dead entombed beneath Castle Kalaman lies the body of Knight Zanas [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md). A respected knight of the Order of the Crown, [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) received a divine quest from the god Paladine years before the Cataclysm. Paladine told him the Kingpriest of Istar had created a magical wonder in the east—a flying city (detailed in chapter 6)—and in so doing, the kingpriest had enraged the metallic dragons that had long remained hidden on Krynn. Paladine tasked [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) with going to this flying city, assuaging the dragons' fury, and convincing the kingpriest to return the city to the land. [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) agreed. The knight knew his task was daunting, though, and decided to hedge his bets. He took his family's greatest treasure with him: an ancient [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md).

[Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) and his fellow knights reached the kingpriest's flying city and stood before a flight of righteously furious metallic dragons. When the kingpriest refused to land the flying city, the dragons refused to leave. As the conflict escalated, [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) used his [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) to slay the dragons' leader, the gold dragon [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md). As soon as [Karavarix](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/karavarix-dsotdq.md)'s blood touched the [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md), the weapon rusted away in Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s hand. The dragons attacked, slaying [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) and crashing the flying city.

A handful of [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s loyal knights escaped, and they brought his body and his cursed [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) back to Kalaman. Both were interred beneath the city, where they remained.

### Lord Soth's Curse

The characters are preceded through Castle Kalaman's catacombs by [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), a villain whose vices allowed the Cataclysm to occur.

#### Lord Soth's Legend

In the years before the Cataclysm, Loren Soth was a Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Rose. He ruled the province of Knightlund from Dargaard Keep. However, his fall from grace began when he rescued a company of Silvanesti elves from raiders, including the priest Isolde and her attendants. Though [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) was married, he fell in love with Isolde—and shortly after, Soth's wife died. He and Isolde married days later. For disrespecting his dead wife's memory, the Knights of Solamnia cast Soth from their orders.

Soon after, the gods called Soth to redeem himself by preventing the Cataclysm, but Soth failed in his quest, and the gods rained destruction on the world. The Knights of Solamnia fell into disgrace in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, and Dargaard Keep became a cursed, haunted ruin.

#### The Rest of the Story

When [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) began his gods-given quest to avert the Cataclysm, he encountered Isolde's attendants, who blamed him for leading Isolde from her holy path. The attendants played on his jealousy, falsely accusing Isolde of being unfaithful. Enraged, Soth ignored the gods' direction and returned to Dargaard Keep to murder her. As he did, the gods unleashed the Cataclysm on the world. With Isolde's dying breath, she cursed Soth to suffer one lifetime for every life lost in the Cataclysm.

For his defiance of the gods, Soth became a death knight, while his followers were similarly reanimated as other Undead. Meanwhile, several of Isolde's attendants became spirits devoted to ensuring Soth never finds peace.

### Cataclysmic Fire

Though the signs of the gods' rage have receded from the world, violet flames from the Cataclysm continue to burn in [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s tomb. This magical fire lingers as a mark of disgrace on one who failed the gods and the world. [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) has come to the catacombs seeking the Cataclysmic fire for its magical properties, which can be harnessed through rituals whispered to him by the Dragon Queen. These phantom flames respond to the memories of the dead and re-create illusory scenes from the moments that haunt their souls.

#### Visions in Fire

As Soth moves through the catacombs, the Cataclysmic fire limning the tombs re-creates tragic scenes from his life. These scenes represent Soth's memories of events—which don't always match the actual events. Every time the characters enter a new area, the illusory flames create figures of violet flame, play out a scene, then harmlessly fade. After reading the description of each room, paraphrase the next scene from the following list:

- **Meeting.** A Knight of Solamnia saves a group of elf travelers from ogre raiders. An elf woman falls into the knight's arms. Behind him, the silhouette of a human woman turns and fades away.  
- **Disgraced.** The knight from the previous vision is cast out from a group of other knights. The scene fades into a wedding between the knight and the elf woman from the previous vision.  
- **Quest.** The knight receives a vision from a beam of divine light. As his wife pleads with him, he dons his armor and mounts his steed, then heads off.  
- **Distraction.** The knight's encounters the attendants of the elf woman from the first vision. They taunt him and point back the way he came. The knight slays them and turns back home in a rage.  
- **Confrontation.** The knight slays his wife as the world around him crumbles and burns. The knight burns as well, but he doesn't fall. His armor fuses with his body; his eyes blaze with flames; and he becomes a terrifying, deathless figure.  

If the characters enter a room after all these scenes have played out, skeletal visages leer at them from the flames, then vanish. Characters who recalled [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s legend in the "Caught in the Act" section recognize that these scenes relate to his tale. If no characters succeeded on that check, they can make the DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check again with advantage after seeing the first two scenes. On a success, they recall everything in that section.

Though the full truth of [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s tale remains vague, the characters might learn more when they encounter [Leedara](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/leedara-dsotdq.md) again in chapter 7.

### Raided Catacombs Features

The catacombs beneath Castle Kalaman have the following features:

- **Cataclysmic Flames.** Illusory violet flames fill the catacombs with dim light. These flames create no heat and don't harm creatures that touch them.  
- **Ceilings.** The ceilings throughout the catacombs are 15 feet high.  
- **Doors.** The doors throughout the catacombs are made of stone. They can be opened only by creatures with a combined Strength of 20 or higher.  

### Raided Catacombs Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.4: Raided Catacombs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/066-map-4.04-raided-catacombs.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/067-map-4.04-raided-catacombs-player.webp#gallery)

#### R1: Hall of Knights

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stairs descend into a stone chamber engulfed in violet flames. In the fire stand four dignified statues of Knights of Solamnia. At the east end of the room lies an antechamber before a stone double door. There, a fifth statue depicts a bison-headed warrior.
^20f

The statues depict four historic leaders of the Knights of Solamnia and the bison-headed god Kiri-Jolith. A cleric of Kiri-Jolith or a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes the statue of Kiri-Jolith, god of honor and war.

The flames are Cataclysmic fire (see the "Cataclysmic Fire" section). Once the characters enter, the first scene from the "Visions in Fire" section plays.

#### R2: Crypts

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This long chamber blazes with violet flame. The walls are lined with alcoves, within which lie bodies wrapped in yellowed cloth. A brazier rests at the end of the hall. A section of wall has been smashed to the southwest, creating a crude tunnel to the catacombs beyond. To the southeast stands a closed stone door.
^211

As the characters enter this area, the next scene from the "Visions in Fire" section plays out.

##### Burial Alcoves

Fifteen forgotten Knights of Solamnia are buried here, each with their now-rusted plate armor and longsword. If any of the bodies are disturbed, two [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) that look like spectral Knights of Solamnia emerge from crypts and attack. The wraiths vanish if a character returns any stolen goods and makes an earnest apology.

##### Broken Passage

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) smashed through the catacomb's wall to venture directly toward area R7. A character with the Stonecunning trait can tell this tunnel was created only a short while ago.

#### R3: Tomb of Vaunted Steel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Violet flames engulf this room, dancing across walls with faded mosaics of blacksmiths forging gleaming weapons. Bars seal off alcoves to the north and south. To the west, weapons hang on the walls. A crude tunnel has been punched through the south wall there.
^215

As the characters enter this area, the next scene from the "Visions in Fire" section plays out.

##### Sealed Tombs

The two tombs commemorate honored Solamnic weaponsmiths. Their burial places are sealed behind iron bars, which are Medium objects with AC 19, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The north tomb contains a skeleton clutching a [berserker axe](Mechanics/items/berserker-axe.md).

The south tomb is empty except for an iron amulet shaped like a smith's hammer. A cleric of Reorx or a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes this as a holy symbol of Reorx, god of craft.

##### Broken Passage

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) destroyed a door and a section of wall here to reach area R7. Characters with the Stonecunning trait or who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check can tell this destruction occurred recently and the narrow passage is dangerously unstable. The first creature to pass 5 feet along this passage must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw as the south end of the path collapses, blocking the way to area R7. On a successful save, the creature safely dodges back into area R3. On a failed save, it takes `4d6` bludgeoning damage and is forced into area R3.

##### Treasure

The weapons to the west are the armaments of heroic Solamnic knights and their allies. Most are rotted or rusted through, but characters can find a [+1 longsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md), a [mithral breastplate](Mechanics/items/mithral-armor.md), and a [Kagonesti forest shroud](Mechanics/items/kagonesti-forest-shroud-dsotdq.md) (see appendix A).

#### R4: Hall of Steeds

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mosaics of knights riding armored stallions cover the walls of this room and are limned in violet flames. To the east lies a shattered stone door, and north of it gapes a tunnel that leads back to the catacomb entrance. At the west end of the room stands a statue of a rearing horse and two stone doors leading south.
^21a

As the characters enter this area, the next scene from the "Visions in Fire" section plays out. After the scene completes, two [warhorse skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warhorse-skeleton.md) manifest at the west end of the hall. These are the remains of the heroic warhorses Xheriev and Steelwind, which attack. However, if a character is wearing the armor of a Solamnic knight or succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check, the skeletons stop, bow, and vanish. That character then gains the following charm (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

- [Favor of the Heroic Steed](Mechanics/rewards/favor-of-the-heroic-steed-dsotdq.md)  

#### R5: Monument of the Lost

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber blazes with violet flames. In the middle of the room, steps lead up to a sleek marble monument etched with hundreds of lines of text. Doors lead from the room to the north and east.
^21d

As the characters enter this area, the next scene from the "Visions in Fire" section unfolds.

##### Marble Slabs

The monument in this room records the Knights of Solamnia who served at Castle Kalaman and died with honor. A character who reads the monument finds the names of Knight Vogler and Knight Jandin (whom the characters meet in area R6).

#### R6: Shrine of the Honored

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A statue of a saluting Knight of Solamnia stands in this room, along with two tall marble slabs etched with text. All three crackle with violet flames, and the spirit of a Knight of Solamnia kneels before one of the slabs. A door leads to the west, and a double door leads to the east.
^220

As the characters enter this area, the next scene from the "Visions in Fire" section plays out.

##### Marble Slabs

The marble slabs here bear the names of honored heroes and leaders among the Knights of Solamnia who served at Castle Kalaman. A character who reads the names finds Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) on the list.

##### Knight Spirit

The kneeling spirit is incorporeal and harmless. If attacked, she fades away and doesn't reappear.

This spirit was among those knights who journeyed with Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md). If the characters converse with her, she introduces herself as Knight Jandin, a knight of the Order of the Sword who died during the Cataclysm. She shares the information from "Knight Sarlamir's Curse" at the start of this section, along with the following information:

- When Jandin returned [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s body to Kalaman, she twisted the truth, reporting [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) died defending people from rampaging evil dragons. [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) was entombed a hero.  
- Jandin regrets this, knowing [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s disobedience and deeds contributed to the gods' disfavor—and ultimately to the Cataclysm. She believes herself complicit in her fellow knight's disgrace.  
- She asks the characters to take the weapon entombed with [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) in the next chamber. Perhaps in their hands, it can find redemption and the gods' favor.  
- The flames blazing through the tombs are fire from the Cataclysm. They used to be confined to [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s tomb, but now they run rampant. Jandin doesn't know why (she's unaware of [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s presence).  

After relating this information, Knight Jandin wishes the characters luck and fades away.

#### R7: Tomb of Heroes

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Violet flames outline the tombs set into the walls of this spacious crypt. A heavy stone brazier sits empty near the room's center. A sarcophagus to the north lies in pieces at the mouth of a crumbling tunnel. A wall to the southeast is similarly broken.
> 
> At the far end of the tomb, a flaming dais holds a sarcophagus sculpted with the image of a knight. A life-sized sculpture of a dead dragon impaled with a spear curls around the sarcophagus.
> 
> Something within this sarcophagus moves, slamming against the lid, as the unnatural flames on the dais blaze with wild intensity.
^224

When the characters enter this room, any remaining scenes from the "Visions in Fire" section unfold. Read the following text after all the scenes have played out and the characters are in this area:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The violet flames waver, forming ominous images once more. The terrifying knight from the last vision steps through the wall. He approaches the brazier at the room's center, above which roils a flaming orb. The knight holds up a scepter sculpted with screaming faces. Once touched to the ball of flame, the scepter ignites and the orb vanishes. The knight admires the flaming scepter, then points it at the ornate tomb and statue at the end of this room. Both burst into flames that spread throughout the crypt. The figure then moves to the south wall and vanishes.
^225

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) was here minutes before the characters and claimed a portion of the Cataclysmic fire that cursed this tomb. He then shattered the south wall, creating a passage high in the cliffs beneath Castle Kalaman. After this scene plays out, another violent blow shakes the tomb surrounded by the sculpted dragon.

##### Sarlamir's Tomb

[Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s tomb rests to the east and bears the words "Zanas [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md), Knight of the Crown." A creature can open it with a successful DC 12 Strength check. Within lie the knight's animate remains (see below). If the characters don't open the crypt, [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) shatters the lid and emerges 3 rounds after they enter the room.

##### Knight Sarlamir

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) used the Cataclysmic fire to reanimate [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) as a [skeletal knight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-knight-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). The Undead knight wears ancient Solamnic armor and wields a blade blazing with violet flame. He attacks the characters as soon as he emerges and fights until destroyed.

[Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) speaks as he attacks, making it clear he's compelled by Soth's magic. In a hollow voice, the armored skeleton proclaims the following:

- The cursed knight, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), calls to [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) through the haunted flames of the Cataclysm.  
- [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) commands [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) to slay those who would oppose Soth.  
- Soth beckons [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) to follow him north—back to the place of his dishonor, the place in the Northern Wastes Soth calls the City of Lost Names.  

As soon as [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) is defeated, the violet flames around his weapon and elsewhere in the catacombs dim, then vanish. Make sure [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md) mentions the City of Lost Names and the Northern Wastes, even if it's as a final gasp. The characters will learn more about these places in chapter 5.

![Knight Sarlamir](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/068-04-008.knight-sarlamir.webp#center)

##### North Passage

If the broken passage in the north wall hasn't already collapsed, it does so if a creature proceeds more than 5 feet down it. See area R3 for details on how the passage collapses. Characters caught in the collapse are forced into area R7 rather than R3.

##### South Passage

This crude passage emerges 80 feet up a sheer cliff beneath the walls of Castle Kalaman. Below are paved streets and the rooftops of buildings. There is no sign of [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md), who has already met with any of his surviving Undead knights and ridden from the city. See the beginning of chapter 5 for details on where Soth heads next.

##### Treasure

Inside [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md)'s tomb is the distinctive head of a rusty spear—all that remains of his [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md). A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of evocation magic, though the spearhead has no obvious properties. A character who tries to attune to the item and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check discovers that the spearhead is magical but that divine power has rendered its magic inert. The other tombs in this room are empty except for bones and rusty armor.

### Next Steps

After defeating Knight [Sarlamir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sarlamir-dsotdq.md), the characters advance to 6th level. Once the Cataclysmic flames fade, the catacombs return to normal.

#### Soth's Escape

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) has vanished, taking a scepter blazing with haunted flames along with him. If the characters try to pursue him, he and his Undead knights have already departed the city, their objectives complete. No one is certain where they headed after leaving, though this is revealed at the start of the next chapter.

#### Sanctuary Shattered

By the time the characters emerge from the catacombs, the council room's carnage has been mostly cleared.

Several hours later, Darrett arrives in Kalaman with Marshal Vendri, Lord Bakaris, and the bulk of the city's martial forces. They're shocked to learn what happened. Marshal Vendri moves swiftly to keep order in the city and ensure no more attacks are forthcoming. At the same time, Darrett seeks out the characters to learn more. He pays particular interest to what they have to say about [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) and the City of Lost Names—two names that guide the characters in the following chapter.
