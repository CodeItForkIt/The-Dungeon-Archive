# Chapter 2: Prelude to War
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 37* 

The Dragon Queen's conquest of Ansalon has begun. The eastern half of the continent has already fallen, and the Red Dragon Army has tested its forces against isolated and fractious lands. The Dragon Army now turns its attention to the west—to the land of Solamnia, a nation known as the home of knights and heroes. Now, the true war begins.

*Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen* tells the tale of the Dragon Army's first strike into Solamnia and thrusts a group of heroes into the path of a world-altering war. This chapter provides an overview of the adventure presented in the chapters to come, as well as details on how to further involve the characters in the plot.

## Overview

*Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen* is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure optimized for four to six player characters. The characters are the heroes of the story; this book describes the villains the heroes must overcome and the locations they must explore to bring the adventure to its conclusion.

This book also presents the continent of Ansalon on the planet of Krynn, home of the Dragonlance campaign setting. The introduction and chapter 1 cover broad details of the world but focus on the lands surrounding the city of Kalaman in the nation of Solamnia—the setting of the adventure presented in this book. Prominent details about the setting are covered in these sections, but the wider world is left for you to detail as you please.

## Running the Adventure

To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ("Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual").

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance as described in the text.
^094

When a creature's name appears in **bold** type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, "Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it." The "Monster Manual" contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in this adventure. The rest can be found in appendix B.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the "Player's Handbook" unless the text points you to appendix A. Magic items are described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" unless the text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.

### Using the Maps

This book contains a number of interior maps and a foldout poster map.

#### Interior Maps

Maps that appear in this book are largely for the DM's eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or another surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your maps don't need to be exact replicas of the originals, and you can alter their features as you see fit. Omit details that aren't readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters can detect and interact with them. Appendix E provides two maps for player use. Reproduce these maps and share them with your players as you see fit.

#### Poster Map

The poster map is meant to be shared with the players. It depicts the continent of Ansalon on the world of Krynn. While this adventure takes place on only one small part of this map, the lands depicted here are referenced throughout this book. Players can use this map to gain context for the adventure and to determine what lands are important to their characters.

### Chapter 2: Preludes

This chapter provides introductory elements to develop the bonds between characters and set them on the path to the community where the adventure begins. The rest of the chapter provides prelude encounters that establish important details about the world of Krynn.

### Chapter 3: When Home Burns

The characters come to the village of Vogler to attend the funeral of a friend and to participate in the Kingfisher Festival, a local tradition. During the festival, a reenactment of a legendary battle goes awry when treacherous mercenaries attack. This ambush foreshadows a greater attack by the Dragon Army. The characters must help the people of Vogler escape the village before the Red Dragon Army overwhelms them.

Encourage the characters to forge connections to each other and to the earnestly hospitable people of Vogler. Many of the people the characters meet here will be their allies throughout the adventure, and the characters should have developed a relationship with the community by the time the Dragon Army attacks.

### Chapter 4: Shadow of War

The characters and the people of Vogler flee to the city of Kalaman. There, the characters are conscripted to fight alongside Kalaman's troops against the Dragon Army menace. The characters and their allies defend against Dragon Army threats, culminating in a surprise attack on Kalaman by the death knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md).

In this chapter, the characters must ally with Kalaman's military against the Dragon Army. The characters' experience in Vogler should give them personal stakes in this conflict. The characters' relationship with Kalaman's military is flexible, whether they're members of the army, special adventuring agents, or something less formal. The characters should view Kalaman and its military leadership as allies.

### Chapter 5: The Northern Wastes

The characters' encounter with [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) revealed the Dragon Army desires more than just conquest in the Kalaman region. In the Northern Wastes, the forces of the Dragon Queen seek a ruin called the City of Lost Names. The characters and a detachment of Kalaman's troops venture into the Northern Wastes to find the lost city and prevent whatever wickedness the Dragon Army plots.

In this chapter, the characters and their allies from Kalaman's military explore the dangerous Northern Wastes and discover the region isn't as empty as the people of Kalaman say. This part of the adventure is largely free form, and how it progresses is up to you and the players.

### Chapter 6: City of Lost Names

Upon finding the City of Lost Names, the characters must infiltrate the ruin as it teems with enemy forces. There, the characters learn the Dragon Army seeks to make the ancient, magical ruin fly as it did in the distant past. The characters must find the source of the ancient city's magic and prevent Dragon Army commanders from taking control.

This chapter presents a vast ruin the characters can explore as they please while dodging the occupying Dragon Army forces. Here, the Dragon Army's plan in the Northern Wastes comes into view: to reactivate the City of Lost Names as a magical flying war machine. Use defeated Dragon Army forces and captured intelligence to direct the characters toward the Dragon Army's leaders and, potentially, the restoration of a [dragonlance](Mechanics/items/dragonlance-ftd.md) (see appendix A). Also use these forces to deter the characters from visiting the Bastion of Takhisis, which takes center stage in the next part of the adventure.

### Chapter 7: Siege of Kalaman

The City of Lost Names shatters into dozens of flying pieces. One of these carries an ancient temple of the evil gods into the sky. This flying citadel and the rest of the Dragon Army converge on Kalaman. The characters must aid in the city's defense, then infiltrate the flying citadel and bring it down.

This chapter pits the characters and their allies against the full might of the Dragon Army. The lead-up to the Dragon Army's attack is a great time for allies to return and support the characters. Ultimately, the characters have the opportunity to infiltrate the Dragon Army's flying citadel and destroy it. This daring operation will bring the characters face-to-face with the infamous Lord Soth and the Dragon Army commander Highmaster Kansaldi Fire-Eyes (detailed later in this chapter).

## The Dragon Queen's Threat

![After centuries of secrecy...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/030-02-002.dragon-queen-followers.webp#center "After centuries of secrecy, the followers of the Dragon Queen emerge prepared for war")

Throughout this adventure, most of the characters' foes are servants of Takhisis the Dragon Queen, an evil god who seeks to conquer Krynn. Her agents are many, but her organized forces are known as the Dragon Armies. This book's introduction provides additional details on Takhisis and the Dragon Armies. As the adventure unfolds, the characters find themselves opposed by several of the Dragon Queen's agents. The characters' goal in this adventure isn't to lay low the entirety of the Dragon Armies or to stop the threat of the Dragon Queen herself. Rather, their deeds will oppose the Red Dragon Army's forces seeking to conquer the Kalaman region.

### Draconians

As early as the preludes later in this chapter, the characters will face the Dragon Army's secret weapon: draconians. These dragon-like monstrosities are unnatural creatures born of the Dragon Queen's foul magic. All draconians are fanatically devoted to Takhisis and want nothing more than her conquest of the world. They are utterly loyal to the Dragon Army and those who speak in their god's name. In the course of the adventure, present draconians as magical, monstrous, fanatical, and unknowable. They aren't creatures with their own goals and ambitions. Rather, they are magical manifestations of the Dragon Queen's thirst for conquest, and they wreak her will with lethal efficacy.

The various draconians of Krynn are detailed in appendix B.

### Kansaldi Fire-Eyes

Dragon Highmaster [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md) leads a massive contingent of the Red Dragon Army. Following orders from her master, Dragon Highlord Verminaard, Kansaldi seeks to conquer Kalaman in the Dragon Queen's name. To aid in this mission, Kansaldi has ordered the black-robed wizard [Lohezet](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lohezet-dsotdq.md) to follow his research to a ruin in the Northern Wastes, where he believes a great weapon lies in wait. An array of lesser commanders supports Kansaldi's operations, including her trusted adviser, [Belephaion](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/belephaion-dsotdq.md) (detailed in chapter 6), and the dragonnel-riding ace known as [Red Ruin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/red-ruin-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B). The Dragon Queen has ordered the death knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) to cooperate with Kansaldi. While Kansaldi respects the knight's lethal efficacy, she largely leaves him to his own dreadful devices.

Kansaldi is the ultimate villain of this adventure and confronts the characters at the climax of chapter 7. Throughout the adventure, use apprehended Dragon Army soldiers and captured intelligence to reveal details about Kansaldi, primarily her fanatical devotion to the Dragon Queen, the fear and respect she commands from her troops, her tactical prowess, and her signature crimson eye.

More details on Kansaldi appear in appendix B.

### Lord Soth

As the Dragon Queen turns her ambitions toward Solamnia, she summons forth one of its foulest villains: the infamous death knight [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md). This villain has allied himself with the Dragon Queen to retake his ancestral land of Nightlund and take vengeance against the hated Knights of Solamnia. However, he isn't a member of the Dragon Army or a commander of its troops. Soth and his Undead knights keep their own council and have their own agendas. The only person whose lead Soth follows is [Kansaldi Fire-Eyes](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kansaldi-fire-eyes-dsotdq.md), and that is only because she speaks on behalf of the Dragon Queen herself.

While [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) is well known in tales of the Dragonlance setting, this adventure doesn't assume the characters, or most of Kalaman's people, know the death knight's legend or expect him to be at work in the world. The characters can learn relevant details about [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) throughout the adventure. Even as the characters reach their highest levels, [Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md) likely remains too great a threat for them to defeat. Rather than presenting him as a foe to be challenged in combat, portray Soth as a terrifying example of the villains in the Dragon Queen's service—a lurking threat to be avoided. By the adventure's end, the characters will have opportunities to undermine Soth's plans and remove him from the Dragon Army's service—at least for a time.

[Lord Soth](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lord-soth-dsotdq.md)'s stat block appears in appendix B, and his history is summarized in chapter 4.

## Character Connections

Players should use chapter 1 to create characters connected to Krynn and, if possible, to one another. They should also each have a connection to a mutual friend named Ispin Greenshield. Ispin has recently passed away, and the characters are invited to his funeral in Vogler.

### Ispin Greenshield

Before retiring to the village of Vogler, Ispin Greenshield traveled across Ansalon as a teacher, trader, and adventurer. Along the way, he forged friendships with each of the characters. Each character knows the following information about him:

- Ispin was a good-natured human adventurer from Solamnia.  
- Ispin took his name from a distinctive green shield he found early in his adventuring career. He claimed the shield was magical, but it had no obvious magical properties.  
- The bighearted Ispin loved telling tall tales of his travels to anyone who would listen.  
- Ispin used to adventure with a human Knight of Solamnia named Becklin and a hill dwarf warrior named Cudgel. These two featured in many of Ispin's stories of fighting sea monsters and goblin raiders.  
- Ispin retired from traveling years ago, becoming a permanent resident of a little-known village in Solamnia called Vogler.  

The Meeting Ispin Greenshield table suggests a few ways characters might have come to know and likely respect Ispin. Players can elaborate on these connections however they'd like. Characters can use their relationship with Ispin to reinforce how they know one another.

^meeting-ispin-greenshield

### Invitation to a Funeral

Ispin Greenshield wished to have his life celebrated in a simple way, with friends from the lands he traveled joining for festivities and sharing stories. Upon Ispin's death, his friend [Becklin Uth Viharin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/becklin-uth-viharin-dsotdq.md), a Solamnic knight stationed in Vogler, sought to fulfill Ispin's wish and sent each of the characters a copy of the letter presented as handout 2.1.

Each character has agreed to attend Ispin's funeral and has set off on the road to Vogler. The extent of this undertaking might vary for each character. Characters who travel by sea disembark at the port of Kalaman (detailed in chapter 4) and then travel by road to Vogler. The characters' travels are largely uneventful until the final leg of their journey (see the "Preludes" section). Chapter 3 gives characters who have not been traveling together the opportunity to reunite and share details of their journeys.

## Preludes

This section presents three short encounters for 1st-level characters, each highlighting a unique aspect of the Dragonlance setting. These encounters focus on the following events:

**"Broken Silence"** heralds the gods' return and provides participating characters with a better understanding of their relationship to the gods.

**"Eye in the Sky"** sets participating characters on the path to becoming members of the Mages of High Sorcery (see chapter 1).

**"Scales of War"** reveals the mysterious draconians.

Before starting the adventure in chapter 3, review the encounters here and choose one or more to run that are relevant to characters in your group. The Prelude Overview table notes what types of characters are likely to be interested in which encounters.

**Prelude Overview**

| Encounter | Focal Characters |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Broken Silence" | Clerics, druids, paladins, and other characters with god-given powers |
| "Eye in the Sky" | Sorcerers, warlocks, wizards, or others seeking membership in the Mages of High Sorcery |
| "Scales of War" | Any character |

> 
> If you are using the *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn* board game alongside this adventure, consider playing scenario 0 in that game after completing the "Preludes" section and before proceeding with chapter 3. This scenario has no ties to the overarching adventure, but it will familiarize the players with the game before it becomes relevant in chapter 3.
^warriors-of-krynn-introduction

### Running Preludes

The encounters in this section take place after characters have received their invitations to Ispin Greenshield's funeral. Before heading to Vogler or on their way to the village, each character should participate in a prelude encounter.

After you've determined which preludes to run, choose which characters will participate in which. Then consider how to best run each prelude you're using:

- **Focus on Specific Characters.** Run the prelude with a spotlight on the focus characters. Consider running it with a single player or a small group of players before the adventure begins. The "Broken Silence" and "Eye in the Sky" preludes lend themselves to this.  
- **Focus on the Group.** Run the prelude for a group of characters. These characters meet during their travels and participate in the encounter together. The "Scales of War" prelude lends itself to this.  

Throughout these preludes, mentions of "characters" refer to those characters who are the focus of the prelude. Characters can participate in preludes that don't focus on them; they just won't gain a divine connection as a result of participating in the "Broken Silence" prelude or a relationship to the Mages of High Sorcery in the "Eye in the Sky" prelude if they don't want to join that organization.

Once you've run any preludes you deem appropriate for your group, all characters advance to level 2. After this, proceed with chapter 3.

### Broken Silence

For hundreds of years, the world of Krynn has been bereft of those who call upon the favor of the gods. Legends say deities turned away from the world after the Cataclysm, and the prayers of the few who remember them have been met with silence ever since. But that silence is now being broken. A chosen few hear the call of the gods and awaken to their power. This prelude suits characters who hear that calling and respond to it.

#### Running This Prelude

Characters in this prelude can come from any background. Perhaps they're discovering the gods for the first time, or they might be steadfast followers. Characters who draw their magic from gods won't have access to spells or magical class features until the end of the encounter, as this prelude details a meeting with their deity. Characters with no special interest in serving a deity might participate in the "Scales of War" prelude instead.

The prelude unfolds in a surreal, dreamlike situation where characters can follow a divine calling to learn about their deity's goals and become one of their chosen. You may alter any of this prelude's elements to better match individual gods' virtues and identities.

Before you begin, make sure any players involved have chosen gods for their characters. Krynn's deities and their provinces are listed in this book's introduction.

#### Visions of Divinity

This prelude focuses on characters who have been experiencing a recurring vision that comes to them in times of great turmoil or doubt. This vision might be a recent occurrence or something they've been experiencing for a long time, possibly since childhood.

The read-aloud text below describes such a vision. You can add details that correspond to each character's deity. For example, a character who worships Sirrion might find the surrounding forest aflame, while a character called by Paladine might notice the fallen soldier's eyes turning into pools of silver.

Read or paraphrase the following text to describe the vision the characters have been having:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You stand at the center of a forest clearing. Clashing steel echoes from the thicket beyond. As you look around, you realize piles of bodies cover the ground. One of the fallen clutches something against their chest. You're not sure what it is, but you feel the urge to reach for it. Before you can, the object glows and then flashes with intense light.
^0b5

![Kiri-Jolith, God of War, i...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/032-02-004.kiri-jolith.webp#center "Kiri-Jolith, God of War, is one of many deities seeking followers to carry their faith back to Krynn")

The characters wake after having the vision and find nothing out of the ordinary. They realize the object in the vision was an amulet. The amulet bears a design they might not recognize, but is the symbol of the god the character's player chose during character creation. The echoes of battle don't mean anything in particular to the characters but feel like a bad omen.

#### Lost and Found

Prior to the vision, the characters were traveling to Vogler and had stopped to camp or rest near a forested path. After experiencing the vision, the characters wake to find their camp sacked and some of their belongings missing. The characters are the only creatures in the camp; no one else who might have been traveling with them is in sight.

A character who examines the surroundings finds a trail of food, cloth, and discarded trinkets that leads into the brush. A few hundred feet away, the characters find their belongings discarded in the middle of the forest. Nothing is missing or damaged. There is no sign of what brought the characters' possessions here.

#### Mysterious Symbol and Temple

Among their belongings, the characters find an item that closely matches the amulet from their visions. As in the vision, the characters might feel inexplicably drawn to the item. If the characters have different gods, they each find a holy symbol for their chosen deity. As soon as a character touches the amulet, a pulse of divine energy ripples from them, causing the amulet to vanish from their hands. The pulse flattens the surrounding vegetation, creating an unnatural clearing similar to the one in the characters' visions. The cleared plants also reveal overgrown ruins nearby:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A crumbling stone structure lies among the undergrowth. Its roof is pierced by the trunk of an immense tree, but its walls are mostly intact. A large, empty doorframe leads inside.
^0b8

Characters who don't approach the ruin feel supernaturally drawn toward the place, as if a familiar voice were calling their name. As characters approach the door, they hear faint voices inside.

Read the following text when the characters enter the ruin:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tree visible from outside breaks through the ruin's marble floor and stretches through the collapsed ceiling. Around it, broken statues line the remaining walls, standing in crumbling alcoves.
^0b9

The statues were once larger-than-life depictions of several of Krynn's deities, but most of them are ruined. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check can identify as many of the statues as you deem appropriate. The character instantly recognizes the statue of the god whose symbol they just found.

#### Divine Manifestation

Soon after the characters enter the room, a faint glow begins emanating from the statue of the god whose symbol they just discovered. The glow coalesces around the ruined statue, creating a spectral semblance of what the statue looked like in the past. Depending on its nature, the holy symbol might also appear somewhere on or near the statue, perhaps held or worn by it. If the characters have different gods, this happens to multiple statues.

Once a character approaches the statue of their deity, they hear that deity's voice in their thoughts. The deity invites the character to take the holy symbol and become their herald in the world. Use the details on Krynn's deities from the introduction to roleplay the deity. The deity wants the character to carry their power and divine message into the world now—when Krynn needs it most. The god won't elaborate on why they chose the character or why they're revealing themself now. This brief conversation allows characters to learn as much as you deem necessary about their gods, and it ends with the characters gaining access to any god-granted spells and divine class features.

#### Conclusion

As soon as the characters exit and leave sight of the temple, the structure vanishes.

The characters find no trace of any disturbance in their camp. If they were traveling with anyone else, their companions are waiting for them when they return. Any fellow travelers didn't notice the characters leaving the camp and have no recollection of anything strange happening.

Any attempt to return to the ruined temple fails, as if it was never there.

### Eye in the Sky

The Mages of High Sorcery harness the magical power of the three moons of Krynn: Solinari the White, Lunitari the Red, and Nuitari the Black. Those blessed by the moons might show talent for magic and, with proper training, become apprentice mages. But to be accepted into one of the robed orders, a mage must officially join the Mages of High Sorcery and be subjected to the Test of High Sorcery, wherein their dedication to the magical arts is challenged. Failing the test can be deadly, but those who dare to seek magical power without passing the test are branded renegades and enemies of the Mages of High Sorcery.

#### Running This Prelude

The prelude focuses on characters who are apprentice spellcasters aspiring to take the Test of High Sorcery. Characters of any background are welcome, but the focal characters must be able to cast spells. Spellcasting characters with no interest in joining the Mages of High Sorcery might participate in the "Scales of War" prelude instead.

#### Night of the Eye

Every year and a half, the moons of Krynn align in an event known as the Night of the Eye. This prelude unfolds during one of these fateful nights, shortly before the characters head to Vogler.

#### Placing the Prelude

The prelude happens at the Barb, a centuries-old spire where promising apprentice mages go to test their magic. The Barb is located anywhere in the world that befits your story. It was built before the Cataclysm by the Mages of High Sorcery, but its intended purpose is lost to time. Many extradimensional spaces within it remain active, though they're accessible only during the Night of the Eye.

#### Trial of the Barb

The prelude begins with the characters nearing the Barb:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Tonight is an important night. Ahead rises the Barb: a jagged, half-ruined spire of gray stone. Many who aspire to join the Mages of High Sorcery have come here to prove their magical proficiency. The Barb is usually nothing more than a ruin, its construction predating the Cataclysm. But tonight, on the Night of the Eye, when Krynn's three moons align, the ruin is alive with magic once more. Soft light shines from the archway leading into the structure.
^0c1

The characters know that they're here to participate in a test and that if they succeed, they'll learn the next steps to joining the Mages of High Sorcery. They also know any of the information from this prelude's introduction.

When the characters enter the Barb, read the following description to set the scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The arch opens into a large atrium lit with flaming sconces and adorned by grand tapestries depicting Krynn's three moons. Doors circle the room. The light of the moons cascades through broad windows high above. At the center of the room stands a serene-looking woman with long, gray hair and red robes. She nods as you enter.
^0c2

The red-robed mage is named Rovina, and she serves as the Barb's caretaker. She welcomes the characters to the atrium. She explains that the Barb is a place of ancient power where, during the Night of the Eye, magic flares to life to test would-be mages. Rovina also answers any questions the characters have about the Mages of High Sorcery (as detailed in chapter 1).

Characters who examine the tapestries recognize each of the three moons and their relation to the three orders of the Mages of High Sorcery.

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes that while the doors in the room should lead outside, no other entrances into the Barb were visible from the exterior.

![A Spellbook Emblazoned wit...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/033-02-005.spellbook.webp#center "A Spellbook Emblazoned with the Symbol of the Mages of High Sorcery")

#### Rules of the Trial

Rovina leads the characters to a door and shares the following information:

- To pass the night's test, the characters must face the trial in one of the tower's rooms, which are accessible only for the night.  
- The trial requires magical talent but carries none of the dangers of the Test of High Sorcery. It provides a foundation for the real test.  
- The goal is to complete the challenge presented in the room, implying different apprentices will face different challenges.  
- The characters have until the Night of the Eye ends, at which point the rooms vanish, expelling everyone inside.  

#### The Trial Begins

Once the characters are ready, Rovina opens a door, revealing a portal filled with swirling amber light. She directs anyone intending to face the trial to enter the portal together. If a single character is going through this prelude and you think they'd appreciate assistance, Rovina can also admit another visiting apprentice (an [acolyte](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md)) to aid the character.

#### Hall of Sight

As characters pass through the door, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door opens into a wide rotunda with black stone floors and walls carved with elaborate runes. The interior is empty save for a single pedestal at the room's center. Atop the pedestal, an ornate key balances on its tip.
> 
> Behind you, the door you entered through vanishes. On the opposite side of the room, an identical, closed door appears.
^0c6

The room is 100 feet in diameter, with a door on the wall opposite the characters and the pedestal at the center. The door is locked and can be opened only by the key at the center of the rotunda or by casting the [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell on the door.

##### Invisible Maze

If the characters move more than 5 feet toward the pedestal, they run into an invisible wall. The wall extends to the ceiling and is part of an invisible, shifting maze that the characters must traverse to reach the key at the center. The maze is 90 feet in diameter, leaving a 5-foot gap between it and the rotunda's walls.

A character who casts [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) sees the walls of the maze glow with auras of illusion and transmutation magic. Other spells that reveal invisibility, such as [faerie fire](Mechanics/spells/faerie-fire.md) or [see invisibility](Mechanics/spells/see-invisibility.md), also reveal the walls. Characters who can see the walls can easily navigate to the maze's center. Characters who can't see the walls can still complete the test, but doing so takes an hour and requires a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Characters can attempt this check again after an additional hour of effort.

##### Wall Carvings

The carvings on the wall around the rotunda are magical runes. A character who examines the carvings learns their meaning by succeeding on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check or by spending an hour studying them. The runes are an arcane cipher for the [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell. Reading the spell from the wall allows a character to cast the spell as if they were casting it from a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md), except the spell on the wall isn't consumed. The characters can use this spell to open the door and complete the test.

##### Golden Key

Touching the key at the center causes the walls of the maze to vanish. The key can then be used to open the locked door. The key vanishes once it is used.

#### Conclusion

Upon completing the trial and passing through the door, the characters emerge into the atrium of the Barb. Rovina congratulates them on passing the challenge and deems their apprenticeship complete. They are now ready to take the next step on the path to becoming members of the Mages of High Sorcery.

![After completing the Trial...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/034-02-006.scroll-mcguffin.webp#center "After completing the Trial of the Barb, an adventurer receives this scroll and instructions to take it to Wyhan in Kalaman")

Rovina hands each character an ornate scroll and a [spellbook](Mechanics/items/spellbook.md) emblazoned with the symbol of the Mages of High Sorcery. She says the books are meant for the characters, either to use as spellbooks or to fill with their discoveries. The scrolls are meant for the mage who will lead the characters on the next step of their journey: a black-robed mage named [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) who resides in the city of Kalaman near Vogler. The characters have already received their invitation to Ispin Greenshield's funeral, and Kalaman is conveniently nearby.

Rovina tells the characters they must take their scrolls to [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md). She emphasizes that they must not open the scrolls under any circumstances, as their contents are meant for [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) only. More details about [Wyhan](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/wyhan-dsotdq.md) and the characters' next step on the path to joining the Mages of High Sorcery can be found in chapter 4. Rovina will answer any other questions the characters have about the Mages of High Sorcery. After that, she congratulates them once more and bids them good luck on their travels.

### Scales of War

An army carrying the banner of Takhisis the Dragon Queen marches to war, its ranks filled with monstrous, dragon-like beings that revel in destruction. This Dragon Army now encroaches on Solamnia, where its agents already strike beyond the nation's borders, and several farms and garrisons have been sacked.

#### Running This Prelude

The characters witness the aftermath of a vicious attack by draconian servants of the Dragon Army. This prelude is appropriate for characters of all backgrounds and classes.

#### Frantic Farmer

The prelude begins on the road to Vogler. At some point during travel, the characters encounter Rhys, a young human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) who barely survived a recent attack on the caravan he was traveling with.

Read or paraphrase the following text to start this prelude:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you travel down the road, you hear quivering scream from around the next corner. "Please, help!" a young man shouts as he rushes around a bend ahead and races toward you.
^0ce

This young man is Rhys. He's terrified and barely coherent in his frantic pleas for help. If a character spends a minute trying to calm Rhys down, he finally realizes he's not being chased by anything. Once this happens, Rhys reveals the following information:

- Rhys works at a nearby farm and was hired by a group of soldiers to travel with them and care for their horses.  
- Rhys doesn't know much about the soldiers. He heard them talk about enemy troops supposedly afoot in the region.  
- Just moments ago, the soldiers Rhys was with were attacked by black-cloaked figures.  
- Rhys didn't get a good look at the cloaked attackers. He hid in the brush and escaped while the soldiers fought them off.  

If the characters are visibly armed, Rhys urges them to help the soldiers, fearing his employers might fall against their attackers. He can lead the characters to where the caravan was attacked, about a half mile down the road.

Rhys doesn't know this, but the soldiers who hired him weren't merely solders—they were Knights of Solamnia who were deployed to investigate reports of recent attacks by strange creatures in the region.

#### Fallen Caravan

![A terrifying new enemy inf...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DSotDQ/035-02-007.draconian-om-nom-nom.webp#center "A terrifying new enemy infiltrates the shadows of Solamnia: draconians")

Rhys leads the characters down the road. Once they approach the place where Rhys and the soldiers were ambushed, Rhys refuses to go any farther. He tells the characters the soldiers should be just ahead.

The ambush site is a few hundred feet ahead. Read the following text when the characters arrive:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A wrecked wagon lies toppled, surrounded by armored corpses. Strange figures pick through the remains. From beneath the figures' dark cloaks jut scaly wings and sharp, reptilian features
^0d0

The mysterious raiders are a [kapak draconian](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/kapak-draconian-dsotdq.md) and four [baaz draconians](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/baaz-draconian-dsotdq.md) (see appendix B for both stat blocks). They wear armor emblazoned with the symbol of Takhisis, which any character can recognize by succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check.

If the characters want to remain hidden, have them roll Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks against the kapak draconian's passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 13. If the draconians don't notice the characters, they pick the wagon clean of valuables and leave shortly after.

If the draconians notice the characters, the kapak draconian orders two of the baaz draconians to attack, then slips away with the other two into the surrounding forest. The baaz draconians are battered from the fight with the knights and have half their normal hit points. The retreating draconians won't fight the characters under any circumstances; they have orders to immediately rejoin the Dragon Army elsewhere and report on the knights' fate.

##### Murdered Knights

By the time the characters arrive, the three soldiers who hired Rhys have been killed. They are beyond the aid of a [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md) spell. A character who examines the dead soldiers' armor and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes them as Knights of Solamnia.

If the characters search the remains, they find correspondence that states the knights were investigating reports of nearby farmsteads being raided by strange creatures that match the draconians' descriptions.

##### Treasure

The three soldiers each wear plate armor with filigree and horned helmets distinctive to Knights of Solamnia, but each suit bears vicious claw marks that make it unusable. Among the wreckage are also three [longswords](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), eight days of food and water for one person, and 40 gp.

#### Conclusion

Shortly after the draconians are defeated, Rhys rejoins the characters and asks them what those monsters were. He has no idea, and the characters likely don't either. This is one of the first times draconians have made their way into Solamnia, but it won't be the last.

If battle turns against the characters, another group of travelers can be heard approaching on the road. Not wanting to risk a larger fight, the wounded draconians retreat, leaving the characters to be saved by these travelers, who are also headed to Vogler.
