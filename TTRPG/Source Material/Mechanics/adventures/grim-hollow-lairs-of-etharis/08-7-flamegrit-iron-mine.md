# 7: Flamegrit Iron Mine
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 29* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Flamegrit Iron Mine is a mjork lair for four or five 7th-level characters.

## Background

In Stehlenwald province, the small city of Flamegrit is an iron mine that has a problem with elementals. Mjorks have been moving up through the lower levels of the mine, and now they've taken over. The dwarves have sealed off the mine, but they know it won't hold the mjorks forever: the mjorks seek to escape the mine's confines and spread their environment of ash and fire to the whole of Etharis.

### Set the Hook

The easiest way for the characters to be involved is to be in Flamegrit when the mine is sealed; the dwarven council recruits them to clear the top level of the mine and rescue miners trapped there. Perhaps the dwarves have a magic item or resource the characters need, or perhaps the dwarven council's permission is needed to travel through their lands or to explore. Whatever the characters need, the dwarves have it and will give it to the characters if they defeat the mjorks who have shut down their mine.

If you remove the miner-survivors (area 4), it's also possible for the characters to stumble into the mine unwittingly while exploring a dungeon or other subterranean complex (though they have less of a reason to fight through the mjorks in this case). Just age the equipment and give the mine the feel of being abandoned rather than recently usedâ€”perhaps block off the area beyond the double doors in area 1 with a cave-in and have the characters enter from somewhere else.

## Lair Overview

The mine is hot. While rocky surfaces won't cause damage, it is exceptionally warm, like the inside of a sauna. Prolonged exposure without a buffer or cooler causes characters to accrue levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at a rate of one level per eight hours. The air is stale and sooty, even in areas lacking mjorks. The northern area of the cavern is largely static, but if the characters delay too long in area 2, two [sootling swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-sootling-swarm-ghloe.md)* climb from the pit and harass them. The [mjork charger](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-charger-ghloe.md)* in area 7 is on patrol across the southern area. Exceptionally loud noise (as from a [thunderwave](Mechanics/spells/thunderwave.md) or [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell) draws the charger to almost any location in the mine in `2d4` rounds.

### 1. Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the doors, the air is thick, a fog cloud of ash and soot making it difficult to see more than a few feet. The doors close behind you.
^16b

A [mjork asher](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-asher-ghloe.md)* is here, razing the supplies in the east corner after being unable to get through the doors out of the mine. It attacks immediately. The supplies are ruined slag. The doors have been barred from the other side; characters must communicate with the guards to get them to open the doors.

#### Asher Fog

The mjork asher's smoke shroud is in effect, emanating from its starting position near the supplies.

### 2. North Side

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mine's central excavation stretches before you. Directly to the south, a cavernous pit with a stone bridge leading up to the south side. To the west, a cave. To the east, supplies, stacks of raw ore, and a large mining elevator.
^16f

The ore is iron, brought up on the elevator before the mjorks destroyed it.

#### Pit

The central scar is between fifty and sixty feet deep, leading to the next level of the mine. Due to the mjorks' interference, the floor of the lower level is extremely hot; characters who contact it directly take 2 (`1d4`) fire damage per round. The branching pathways have been caved in, allowing only Tiny creatures to squeeze through. The ruined mining scaffold on the western side of the pit and the collapsed elevator on the eastern side can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, or the sides of the pit walls can be scaled with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Characters who spend more than a minute on the bottom level are attacked by three [sootling swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-sootling-swarm-ghloe.md)* that emerge from the side tunnels.

### 3. Smoking Crates

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Dozens of crates marked with symbols for climbing gear and mining equipment are emitting tendrils of smoke. Many appear scorched.
^173

Three [sootlings](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-sootling-ghloe.md)* hide among the crates, destroying their contents. Patient observation of the crates (five or more minutes) reveals them, as does a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If they survive two rounds of combat with the characters, they realize they won't win and flee toward area 7 for help.

#### Crates

The supplies are mostly destroyed. Characters who spend at least ten minutes salvaging from the crates find all the items in a [dungeoneer's pack](Mechanics/items/dungeoneers-pack.md) minus the rations and waterskin.

### 4. Trapped Miners

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This space has been recently but precisely excavated, forming a narrow tunnel. The muffled sound of hammering is offset by the roar of a fire.
^177

![Mjork Burner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/046-07-008.the-mjork-burner.webp#center)

Four miners (dwarven [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) were cut off from the entrance by the mjorks and retreated into this unfinished excavation tunnel. They managed to throw up a make-shift barricade, but a [mjork burner](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-burner-ghloe.md)* has discovered them and is slowly smashing its way through the barricade. Fighting here draws weak cries and coughs for help from the trapped miners.

#### Barricade

If the characters don't interfere, the mjork burner breaks through the barricade 6 rounds after the characters see it. It proceeds to slaughter the miners. If the mjork is defeated, the miners happily help the characters disassemble the barricade.

#### Miners

The miners are siblings from Clan Izim (Drik, Klup, Gred, and Trilk) and are extremely thankful to be saved. If the characters successfully save all four from the mjorks and escort them safely back to area 1, they promise a boon of 50 gp from their clan treasury. Drik also gives the characters a pretty emerald she recovered while mining; unbeknownst to Drik, it is an [elemental gem (emerald)](Mechanics/items/elemental-gem-emerald.md). The elemental gem and 12 sp can be recovered from the miners' corpses if the characters allow the burner to finish its grim task. The miners willingly share what they know of the mine: they can identify the three paths from the north to south areas, the bunkroom, the general store, and can confirm that there are no survivors below this level of the mine.

### 5. West Cave

![Torcheater](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/047-07-001.torcheater.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cool cave ascends sharply from north to south.
^17c

This cave slopes sharply up 25 feet from the north entrance to the south entrance. The slope is considered "difficult terrain".

#### Torcheaters

A flight of 6 [torcheaters](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/torcheater-ghloe.md)* dwell in this cave, perched among the stalactites 15 feet overhead. They remain motionless and practically invisible unless the characters are carrying a fire-based light source. In that case, they swoop down to consume the light. They have no interest in fighting the characters unless attacked and flee if more than three of their number are slain.

### 6. General Store

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A cramped vestibule is lined with stone chairs. Beyond a stone countertop are rows of shelves, knocked over and singed.
^180

Two [sootling swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-sootling-swarm-ghloe.md)* and 3 [mjorks](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-ghloe.md)* are busy turning the general store into general slag. If interrupted in their destruction, they attack. Combat here that spills out of the store's entrance draws the attention of the [mjork charger](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-charger-ghloe.md)* in area 7 in `1d3` rounds.

#### Till

In a locked stone box behind the counter are 20 gp, 110 sp, and 255 cp. The box's lock can be opened with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

#### Supplies

As elsewhere, valuable supplies have been ruined. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals a matching set of three silk handkerchiefs that escaped the destruction, each worth 15 gp.

### 7. South Side

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From this higher vantage point, the pit seems much deeper. A ruined mining scaffold creaks ominously to the west. A stone bridge ramps down to the north side of the cavern, and a multitude of cave entrances pocket the south wall.
^185

A [mjork charger](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-charger-ghloe.md)* patrols the south side of the cavern. It takes it roughly five minutes to traverse the length of the cavern, stopping to spend about a minute at the entrance to each of four places: areas 6, 8, 10, and 11. It attacks any non-mjorks on sight and attempts to push enemies near the edge of the pit off into the depths. If it spots non-mjorks in any of its patrol areas, it moves to that new location to attack. Exceptionally loud noise (as from a [thunderwave](Mechanics/spells/thunderwave.md) or [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell) draw the charger to almost any location in the mine in `2d4` rounds.

#### Pit and Scaffold

See area 2 for details on the pit. Falling from the north side to the bottom is an 80-foot drop.

### 8. Bunkroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This worked stone chamber is filled with uncomfortable-looking stone bunkbeds and reeks of sweat and soot.
^189

For miners who didn't want to waste time between long shifts, a series of stone slabs with minimal bedding was carved out. Four [mjorks](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-ghloe.md)* have destroyed all the linens and are on their way to finishing the job with the footlockers. Fighting that spills out of this area draws the attention of the [mjork charger](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-charger-ghloe.md)* in area 7.

#### Footlockers

More apt for resting mining picks than safe keeping for belongings between shifts, there are nevertheless a few valuables in these containers. Searching all the footlockers yields a pair of engraved bone dice (25 gp), three emeralds (each worth 50 gp), and 47 sp.

### 9. Abandoned Excavation

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This narrow tunnel is partly excavated and partly natural. Rubble has sealed off what used to be a second entrance.
^18d

The dwarves gave up on this tunnel after their initial efforts collapsed. None of the mjorks are interested in it, making it a superb place to catch a short rest or to hide from pursuing mjorks.

> [!quote]  
> 
> Four mjorks have destroyed all the linens...

### 10. East Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The steady drip of water echoes through this sloped cave, almost drowned out by the sizzle of liquid hitting a hot surface and the sounds of a roaring, hammering fire.
^18f

A [mjork burner](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-burner-ghloe.md)* is flinging itself at the water-coated walls here, trying to dry them out. Each body-slam stings the burner a bit and leads it to be enraged even further. The floor slopes up from the north to the south side at a steep angle, making the floor "difficult terrain". Combat that spills out the south entrance to the cave automatically draws the attention of the [mjork charger](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-charger-ghloe.md)* in area 7.

### 11. Stone Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sharply ascending stone bridge crosses the chasm.
^191

Two [sootling swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/mjork-sootling-swarm-ghloe.md)* are underneath the bridge. Characters looking for danger beneath the bridge have advantage on seeing them with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. The second time a character crosses the bridge, the swarms climb out from below and attack. Combat here draws the attention of the mjork charger* in area 7.

#### Collapse

The swarms have been eating away the wooden support beams holding the bridge in place. While it is still strong enough for a single character to cross, it collapses if two or more characters cross the bridge at the same time. Characters can spot the damage with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to determine the integrity of the bridge before crossing. It's a 60-foot drop off the bridge. If the bridge collapse is the reason for the fall, add 3 (`1d6`) additional bludgeoning damage from the debris to anyone who hits the pit floor.

## Conclusion

Clearing the mjorks from this level of the mine satisfies the dwarven council and completes the characters' quest. The characters can be rewarded and move on, but questions remain unanswered: What lurks below the mine? What caused the mjorks to suddenly emerge from the depths and wreak havoc? Perhaps another nearby mine has also gone dark, and this is the beginning of something far more sinister than a random attack by elementals? While the characters were clearing the mine, perhaps the dwarves above found themselves embattled by another foeâ€”were the mjorks just a convenient distraction? The dwarven council may have more missions for the characters, even if they're not exploring more subterranean spaces.
