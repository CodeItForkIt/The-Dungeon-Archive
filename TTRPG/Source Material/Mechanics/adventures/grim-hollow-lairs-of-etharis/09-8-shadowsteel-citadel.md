# 8: Shadowsteel Citadel
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 33* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Shadowsteel Citadel is a blightscale dragon lair for four or five 8th-level characters.

## Background

Before the dragon's arrival, this mountain stronghold was an open secret. Built near a large settlement, readily supplied with sundries and patrons, it's far enough from civilization that the powers-that-be didn't need to be threatened by its presence. The citadel was devoted with religious fervor to one pursuit: curses. The priests and mages who built the citadel did so through the favors of the common people: curses in exchange for a year of service building, guarding, maintaining, or cooking for the stronghold. Of course, payment in Shadowsteel or sufficient gold was also acceptable, allowing the rich to buy their curses as the poor pledged their service.

Then Chuldroth, a young blightscale dragon, driven mad by his ruined body and knowing distantly of the citadel's work with curses (and blaming it for his condition), attacked it. After causing a rockslide at the entrance and trapping the inhabitants, he tore a hole in the mountainside and made his new lair in the ruins of their cathedral, killing the guardians sent to chase him away. Now only the undead dwell in the citadel, waiting for the dragon to move on to a new lair.

### Set the Hook

There are three easy reasons the characters may be investigating the Shadowsteel Citadel. First, a powerful figure in the nearby city may have sought a curse, but found the entrance blocked—such a figure may hire the characters to investigate. Second, Chuldroth is wreaking havoc on the countryside; the characters may be tracking Chuldroth and followed him back to the citadel. Finally, the characters may stumble on the path leading to the citadel and investigate the caved-in entrance.

## Lair Overview

The citadel was prepared for a siege (after all, in the curse business you never know who might come knocking) but was not ready for a dragon to drop into their cathedral. Rooms meant for the living are generally tidy though dusty, with torches ready to be lit and braziers filled with oil. Rooms built for the dead are tomblike; no sources of light are prepared. When the dragon is absent, the Shadowsteel ghasts occasionally leave their tomb to get materials from the rest of the complex for their fell experiments.

### 1. Path and Cliffs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The path leads to a forbidding cliff face, once smooth but now choked with rubble from a collapse high above. Even at a distance, an opening between the rubble and the cliff is visible a few dozen feet up.
^1a6

Climbing the rubble is easy but time consuming. The hole leading to the interior and area 2 is large enough for a Medium creature; Large creatures can fit by squeezing.

### 2. Collapsed Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hemispheric room has three doors, each with inscriptions cut into their frames. Small piles of rubble from the collapse have been hastily stacked in two piles between the doors.
^1a8

The soldiers trapped by the collapse made a short-lived effort to move the debris before realizing there was too much of it. Only the passage of time has caused the debris to settle enough for an opening to appear.

#### Three Doors

Each inscription is in highly stylized Castinellan. The south door's inscription reads: "Death and Curses." The north door reads: "Long Death." The middle door reads: "Curses Worse than Death." Opening the north or south doors activates the enchantments animating the undead in both spaces labeled area 3. The triggering runes on both doors can be discovered by a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. [Dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) suppresses the rune for an hour, [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) triggers the rune, and it can be deactivated permanently through a successful DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or Thieves' Tools) check. The middle door is locked from this side but not trapped; it can be picked with a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

### 3. Undead Guards

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This roughly square-shaped room with two doors is unfurnished.
^1ac

In each of these rooms, five [skeleton riflers](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton-rifler-ghloe.md)* are lined up along the wall opposite the door to area 2, five more are lined up along the east wall, and a [skeleton commander](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton-commander-ghloe.md)* stands at the ready in the corner between them. The riflers have their firearms trained on the door to area 2 but are immobile unless the rune on the door activates them (see area 2) or someone enters from areas 4 or 5 without speaking the password ("cursed steel" in Castellan). Once activated, the skeleton troopers defend themselves and the rest of the complex until destroyed, pursuing fleeing enemies and fighting to the death.

#### Locked Door

The door to area 5 is locked from both sides. The key is in the dragon's nest in area 13. The lock can be picked with a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

### 4. Empty Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This room is entirely empty except for the thick layer of dust on the floor. Two doors lead out.
^1b0

#### Clawed Footprints

Characters with a passive Perception of 14 or higher note a single trail through the dust from door to door. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check determines they were made by a single Medium-sized biped, while DC 15 reveals that the creature had clawed feet that walked from the west door to the east door and returned the same way.

### 5. Bunkroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This crowded bunkroom has eight sets of bunkbeds and footlockers; doors lead out to the east and west.
^1b4

Half the beds are perfectly made, the other half are in disarray. A few open footlockers have had their contents shredded and strewn about the space. A [sitri cat](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/sitri-cat-ghloe.md)* naps in a bunk. It has been trapped here since the collapse and is starving after having eaten everything it could from the soldiers' footlockers.

#### Locked Door

The door to area 3 is locked. See area 3 for details.

#### Treasure

The indentured soldiers' belongings are in the footlockers. A search of the space finds 27 gp and a small mirror set into a painted wooden frame (worth 25 gp).

### 6. Guarded Negotiations Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two half-walls divide this room. In the west, comfortable chairs surround a pair of circular tables. Two of the chairs are knocked over. In the eastern part of the room, three doors lead out.
^1b9

#### Secret Door

Characters may notice that the way the chairs fell looks like whoever knocked them over was running toward the west wall. Any investigation into why the chairs are tipped over grants advantage on subsequent investigations to find the western secret door leading to area 9. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers the door and the stone button to activate it.

#### Locked Door

The southern door is locked and leads to the armory. The key is in area 13. A successful DC 18 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check opens it.

> [!quote]  
> 
> The few insects here are harmless, but their yellow, lumpy hives are massive.

### 7. Armory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This narrow armory is filled with assorted weapons and armor, gleaming on wooden racks.
^1be

#### Arms and Armor

Six [shortbows](Mechanics/items/shortbow.md), eight [longswords](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), four [pikes](Mechanics/items/pike.md), and three sets of [leather armor](Mechanics/items/leather-armor.md) hang on racks. Two [quivers](Mechanics/items/quiver.md) with 20 [arrows](Mechanics/items/arrows-20.md) each hang from hooks on the wall; five of the arrows in the first quiver are [+1 arrows](Mechanics/items/1-ammunition.md).

### 8. Dead in Waiting

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Six stone sarcophagi, each depicting a featureless robed humanoid form, are arranged in two columns of three.
^1c2

The builders of the citadel lie on these stone coffins, each one twisted by their excessive use of Shadowsteel. Four are currently here, reanimated as [shadowsteel ghouls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadowsteel-ghoul-ghloe.md)*, resting in their coffins until more shadowsteel is available. The northeastern and southwestern sarcophagi are empty. Any creatures passing through this room without speaking the password ("cursed steel" in Castellan) draw them out. They fight to the death and pursue fleeing enemies throughout the complex.

#### Treasure

One of the ghouls is wearing a [cape of the mountebank](Mechanics/items/cape-of-the-mountebank.md).

### 9. Dining Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This area was once a dining hall with two large refectory tables and accompanying benches, now tipped on their sides. The stench of decay is overpowering, emanating from several yellow insect hives scattered around the room creating the soft buzz of insect wings. The northern door is open. The double doors to the west hang slightly ajar.
^1c6

The few insects here are harmless, but their yellow, lumpy hives are massive.

#### Secret Door

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers the secret eastern door leading to area 6 and the stone button to activate it.

### 10. Kitchen

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rough outline of workstations and preparatory tables with hanging pots, pans, and vegetable baskets is visible under an enormous yellow insect hive that covers most surfaces in the room. Two doors exit the room; the northern door is completely covered by the hive.
^1ca

![Mold Spider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/055-08-001.mold-spider.webp#center)

The insects here are harmless, but a colony of [mold spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/mold-spider-ghloe.md)* has claimed the space as well. All the cooking aids have been corroded and rotted, making them useless.

#### Moldy Hitchhikers

If the characters disturb the hive at all (as by clearing the north door, for example), the insects leave their hives and envelop the characters. Disturbing as this is, they retreat after two rounds, leaving behind 3 [mold spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/mold-spider-ghloe.md)* per character.

A meticulous character who picks off every insect eventually sees them, aggravating the spiders, causing all of them to attack the characters they've hitched a ride on. If no one notices immediately, they lie dormant until the characters enter combat or take a rest, chomping down on their fresh prey then.

### 11. Storage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This narrow area is filled with crates, caskets, barrels, and chests marked with the names of foodstuffs and supplies.
^1ce

The door to this chamber kept out the insects, preserving food and supplies.

#### Supplies

Characters willing to peer into every container find 40 days of iron rations, 100 feet of hempen rope, barrels of fresh water, and crates of dry baking ingredients. A successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers one of the chests has a false bottom with 100 gp inside.

### 12. Sacristy

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/056-08-003.eye-crawler.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Wall-to-wall shelves and a central credence table reveal that this vesting room is untouched by the rot just outside its door.
^1d2

An [eye crawler](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/eye-crawler-ghloe.md)* lurks among the books and jars on the table, observing.

#### Treasure

Three sets of black vestments inlaid with gold can be sold for 30 gp each. Most of the books are worth little, but a few tomes on the art of cursing and the magic of Shadowsteel would sell for a total of 50 gp to a collector.

### 13. Ruined Cathedral

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This massive space is lit by a hole smashed in the ceiling. The light is shifting and green, tinted by branches and leaves that make it difficult to see the sky. The north end of the room is covered in debris crushing a raised platform. Wooden pews are cracked and smashed, shoved to the sides. Pockets of smelly puss-filled insect hives litter the ground, and a nest of broken pews is in the southwest corner.
^1d6

Chuldroth, a [young blightscale dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-blightscale-dragon-ghloe.md)*, has made this his temporary lair. He is cunning, but just as desperate as any other blighted creature—far more likely to fly into a murderous rage than to reason calmly.

#### Pews and Rubble

The debris around the room makes the area "difficult terrain".

#### Treasure

Scattered around the area are the remains of the people who made their last stand against the dragon, as well as the precious articles dedicated to the space. This includes the keys to doors in areas 3-5 and 6-8 along with two silver ewers (25 gp each), a [potion of lightning resistance](Mechanics/items/potion-of-lightning-resistance.md), a [+1 shortbow](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md), 638 sp, and 220 gp.

> An eye crawler lurks among the books and jars on the table, observing.

### 14. Undead Alchemy Lab

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This area has another six sarcophagi that match those you saw earlier. On the eastern end of the area is a set of worktables with glass beakers, various jars, and shelves full of dried herbs.
^1db

Two [shadowsteel ghasts](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadowsteel-ghast-ghloe.md)* work tirelessly to perfect their curses and magical defenses. The dragon's intrusion destroyed their support network, so they are slowly planning their escape. The sarcophagi here are empty. They fight to the death if forced to, but if given the chance to flee, they take as much gold as they can carry and use *potions of levitate* to escape through the hole in the roof of area 13.

#### Alchemy Lab

The materials here function as a fully-stocked alchemical lab. By spending an hour breaking down the supplies and taking only essentials, a character proficient in their use can create a complete set of [alchemist's tools](Mechanics/items/alchemists-supplies.md). Two completed potions of levitate are already prepared.

#### Treasure Hoard

The ghasts have been slowly collecting everything of value from the complex when the dragon goes hunting and storing it in the eastern alcove. Along with a chest containing 316 gp, characters may find three silver chalices (30 gp each), four gold bracelets (45 gp each), and a platinum-studded velvet mask (100 gp), all thematically linked to curses and Shadowsteel.

## Conclusion

Defeating the dragon ensures its attacks on the region stop and provide information as to why the citadel is no longer functioning. If the Shadowsteel ghasts escape, they may set up a new "cursed citadel" the characters must find. Similarly, someone was gathering information through the eye crawler in area 12: who wanted to keep an eye on things here? Also, perhaps someone who doesn't know the whole story blames the characters for the citadel's fall—they may be seeking to curse the characters now!
