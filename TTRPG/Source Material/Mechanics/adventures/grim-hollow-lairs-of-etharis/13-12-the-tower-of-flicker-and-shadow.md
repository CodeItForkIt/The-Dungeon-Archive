# 12: The Tower of Flicker and Shadow
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 49* 

*By Greg Marks*

The Tower of Flicker and Shadow is a candlelight daemon lair for four or five 12th-level characters.

## Background

Seeking power, the wizard Henri L'ombre de la Nuit knowingly walked into the Dark Mists of Charneault and came out changed. Any trace of mercy or kindness was scrubbed away, and only a thirst for power remained. In addition, the wizard carried out *The Dark-Hearted Oath*, a spellbook containing vile rituals, including the steps needed to summon a candlelight daemon.

Henri L'ombre de la Nuit is now a necromancer of peerless skill with dreams of greatness. His study of *The Dark-Hearted Oath* only made him stronger. While gathering power and developing his skills, he offended several other wizards and important nobles. Most suspect his ambition, but none realized how dark his heart truly became. He had secretly plagued the city for years, but only recently has his thievery of the dead and use dark magic been uncovered. Several of his rivals and detractors met bloody ends, despite being locked inside their homes. Henri knew his time in the shadows would have to end and his rivals would send assassins after him, just as he did for them. He prepared a death trap in his own tower, hoping to eliminate any would-be heroes standing between him and his final goals.

### Set the Hook

Following a chain of clues that include missing cats, the missing body of a murderer, and a mysterious fire that killed a family of seven, the characters have arrived at a tower in the Charneault Kingdom near Castle Lamesdhonneur. The tower is bathed in shadow, and occasional flickering arcane lights are seen through its narrow windows. The locals shun the Tower of Flicker and Shadow.

#### Alternate Hook

If the party has a patron in your campaign, they were the rival targeted by Henri L'ombre de la Nuit. Their patron has asked the characters to bring the wizard to justice by going to the Tower of Flicker and Shadow to find proof of Henri's misdeeds and arrest the wizard.

## Lair Overview

The tower cannot be entered via teleportation and the walls are enchanted to prevent effects that transmute them, such as [passwall](Mechanics/spells/passwall.md) or [stone shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md). There is one door that provides entrance to the first floor (area 1), and there are two small slit windows on the top floor. The glass windows are similarly enchanted against transmutation or breakage. Each story is 20-feet tall with 5-foot thick stone floors separating them.

### The Death Trap

Henri has left via the portal mirror in area 5 and rigged the tower death trap to activate when the characters enter the tower. When all the characters enter the tower, the following changes occur:

- The windows and exterior door disappear, replaced with sections of wall.  
- The candle in area 5 is lit, summoning a [candlelight daemon](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/candlelight-daemon-ghloe.md)* with orders to kill the intruders.  
- Teleportation and planar travel are impossible through the walls of the tower, except by using the mirror portal in area 5, though one can still teleport within the tower.  
- A [guards and wards](Mechanics/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell triggers. In addition to the corridor fog, magically locked doors, and [webs](Mechanics/spells/web.md) in the stairs, [stinking clouds](Mechanics/spells/stinking-cloud.md) are conjured in areas 2 and 3 and a [suggestion](Mechanics/spells/suggestion.md) is placed in area 1. See the listed areas for specific details.  

### Shadow Pillar

A 5-foot-wide pillar of impenetrable flickering darkness rises from the bottom of the tower through holes in each floor all the way to the very top of the tower. Any creature that is not an undead or fiend that enters or starts its turn in the pillar takes 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage and has its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn. A successful DC 15 Constitution saving halves the damage and negates the decrease in speed. The hole in the floors that the pillar passes through are large enough that a creature could pass through them, provided they are willing to enter the darkness. The candlelight daemon uses the shadow pillar to move from floor to floor without being seen. It utilizes hit and run tactics when the party triggers other combats or traps, taking advantage of the teleportation effect of its horns attack to flee back into the pillar.

### Stairways

Each floor has an enclosed stair that ascends to the next floor. At the top and bottom of each is a locked, reinforced wooden door. Each door has an AC 15 and 25 hp. The doors are immune to poison and psychic damage but vulnerable to fire. The locks can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check or a DC 20 Strength check to force it.

### 1. First Floor–Grand Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A pillar of opaque darkness rises from floor to ceiling in the center of the room. Banners displaying a silver skull over crossed candlesticks hang on the walls, flanking a large chair. A door appears to lead to stairs going up.
^2bc

The grand hall is where Henri would receive guests, seated in his throne-like chair. After the exterior door disappears, four [oblivion brutes](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/oblivion-brute-ghloe.md)* and two [oblivion whistlers](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/oblivion-whistler-ghloe.md)* emerge from the banners. While the creatures attack, they attempt to push living creatures into the shadow pillar.

#### Suggestion

A [suggestion](Mechanics/spells/suggestion.md) from the [guards and wards](Mechanics/spells/guards-and-wards.md) affects the area in front of the stairs. A creature passing through that area must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or stand quietly next to the shadow pillar for 8 hours.

### 2. Second Floor - Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A yellow cloud and numerous bookshelves make it difficult to see across the room. A large, closed tome sits on a reading table in front of a single chair. Another tome is in a glass case over the mantle. A low fire in the hearth provides dim illumination. As below, the pillar of darkness rises through the ceiling.
^2c0

The library is filled with a maze of bookshelves. The collection contains local history, anatomy texts, political treatises, natural history, recipes for candle making, arcana from the real to weird, and a wide selection of fiction dominated by mysteries. Many of the books are rare and the entire collection could be sold for 750 gp to the right collector.

#### Stinking Cloud

This entire area is filled with a [stinking cloud](Mechanics/spells/stinking-cloud.md) (spell save DC 17) from the [guards and wards](Mechanics/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell.

#### Dark-Hearted Oath

Henri's copy of The Dark Hearted Oath rests on the reading table. Inside the tome are copies of all the spells that Henri has memorized, as well as a complete description of a ritual to summon a candlelight daemon and step by step directions for the construction and enchantment of their candle. A successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) notices a nearly invisible rune on the cover. Touching or moving the tome causes the rune to summon six [shadows](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) and three [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) that attack the creature that triggered the rune. The rune can be dispelled as a 6th-level spell. Any creature of non-evil alignment who completes a long rest within 10 feet of the book must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage from nightmares filled with images of them reading The Dark Hearted Oath. If a character fails the saving throw and you are using the Influence dice optional rule from the Grim Hollow's Player's Guide, add one die to the Beast Pool.

*The Dark Hearted Oath* cannot be damaged or destroyed by the characters at this time.

#### Trapped Tome

The tome in the glass case is a trap. A glass box encloses a tome whose cover is embossed with a skull. If the case is opened and exposed to air, an alchemical coating on the tome bursts into flame and fills the library with burnt othur fumes (DC 13 Constitution saving throw). A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check made while the glass case is sealed notices a glistening coating on the book. The trap cannot be disarmed while the case is closed and opening it triggers the trap. The book itself is blank.

### 3. Third Floor–Living Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sleeping area, cooking hearth, and other household essentials take up this floor. A yellow cloud drifts throughout the room. The pillar of darkness goes through the ceiling and floor.
^2c6

The detritus of Henri's life and biological needs take up this floor. It's clear he doesn't spend much time on this floor beyond what is needed.

#### Stinking Cloud

This entire area is filled with a [stinking cloud](Mechanics/spells/stinking-cloud.md) (spell save DC 17) from the guards and wards spell.

#### Treasure

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check locates a [potion of supreme healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-supreme-healing.md) hidden under the bed's mattress.

### 4. Fourth Floor–Laboratory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Framed stain glass windows, with a niche in the wall behind each, decorate an operating theater. A candle burns in each niche, illuminating the stained glass. Bodies under sheets rest upon stone slabs, with trays of surgical tools next to some of them. A counter against the wall is filled with bottles and jars. The ever-present pillar of darkness is here as well.
^2cb

This room is where Henri plies his necromantic trade.

#### Bodies

Seventeen humanoid bodies lie on slabs, each covered by a plain white sheet. There are symbols painted on each, recognizable with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check as preparation for animating the undead. None are animated when the characters arrive in the room.

#### Bottles

The table of solutions contains spell components, organs in embalming fluid, blood, bile, and a host of other disgusting substances. Each is labeled with cramped handwriting.

#### Stained Glass Windows

Four large stained-glass windows decorate the cardinal points in the room. A shallow niche with a magically burning candle is enclosed behind each. The only way to reach the candle is to break the window. The windows depict the following:

- A dark mist populated with ghostly faces rising over a large tome  
- A cowled wizard with a ritual dagger raised over a cat, the blood dripping off the blade to a candle  
- A horned daemonic creature sliding from under a bed while an elderly nobleman sleeps unaware  
- A group of adventures in a room that looks like this one being overwhelmed by undead and daemons.  

Breaking any of the stained-glass windows causes all of them to explode, doing 66 (`12d10`) piercing to all creatures in the room. Note that area of effect spells might cause the windows to explode as well, such as when targeting the candlelight daemon. This extinguishes the candles and plunges the room into darkness. A successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.

The round after the explosion 12 [shatter corpses](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shatter-corpse-ghloe.md)* rise from the slabs. A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) notices arcane runes etching into the lead between the panes of glass. Each window can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check or a Dexterity check with proficiency in thieves' tools. If a skill check is failed by 5 or more, or a dispel magic fails, the windows explode. A window can also be dispelled as a 6th-level spell. For each disabled window, decrease the damage of the explosion by `4d10` and remove 4 [shatter corpses](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shatter-corpse-ghloe.md)*.

### 5. Fifth Floor–Summoning Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A black candle covered in foul runes burns atop a pedestal next to the column of darkness. A mirror is mounted opposite it on the wall.
^2d1

This is the daemon's candle, and if the party makes it this far without having killed the [candlelight daemon](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/candlelight-daemon-ghloe.md)*, it does everything within its power to keep them away from the candle, foregoing its hit-and-run tactics. In addition, Henri ([archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) is scrying on the summoning chamber from afar. If the characters have made this far, he uses the mirror portal to join the fight at an advantageous point, bringing his [staff of frost](Mechanics/items/staff-of-frost.md) with him.

#### Extinguishing the Candle

The candlelight daemon's candle can be extinguished with an action while adjacent to the candle. Strong winds, splashed fluids, or other attempts to smother it from a distance require the character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity check. The candle can also be destroyed by doing 15 points of damage to it. It is immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage and resistant to fire damage. If the candle is extinguished, the candlelight daemon is instantly banished.

#### Mirror Portal

Henri has set up a portal to a cave outside the city, where there is a matching mirror. With a command word, the mirrors fill with darkness in which a single candle flame flickers. By touching the flame in the mirror, and speaking the command word a second time, a creature can step between mirrors as part of their movement.

## Conclusion

With the candlelight daemon banished, the characters can kill or capture Henri L'ombre de la Nuit. There's ample evidence of his wrongdoing in the tower, and he is quickly tried and put to death. For their aid, the characters might be rewarded with the Tower of Flicker and Shadow, on the condition that they purify it. Who knows what other evils or traps await them in the tower? Is there a strong source of evil beneath it? Finding a way to banish the shadow pillar and determining a way to destroy *The Dark Hearted Oath* are both entire quests on their own.
