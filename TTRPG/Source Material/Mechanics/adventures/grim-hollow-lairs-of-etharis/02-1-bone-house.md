# 1: Bone House
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 5* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Bone House is a bone trader lair for four or five 1st-level characters.

## Background

The bone trader Fibekruk has built its "estate" into the cool caverns of this forest-adjacent hillside. The caverns include its bone manse (a haunting negotiations chamber), a nest for its tamed knifewings, a storeroom, and private chambers. Outside the caverns is the forest, which hides the huts of Fibekruk's faevlin minions, their refuse pit, and a ruined cottage used as a storage space.

The bone trader is busy polishing and cleaning its bone collection; its recent efforts have brought it a measure of success, allowing it to move from animal bones to much more prestigious (and tasty) human bones. The creatures it has pressed into service rest comfortably in their nest, content that the faevlin bring them enough snacks—and that the faevlin themselves are always available as snacks if necessary. A small tribe of nine faevlin are spread out across the Bone House. One is assisting the bone trader with its work. Two are moving supplies into the ruined cabin. Two more are searching the refuse pit for trinkets and gold. Two are out hunting (and can return if the characters take too long exploring or dealing with the lair) while two are sleeping in the huts at the camp. If the faevlin have recently abducted anyone, the abductees are imprisoned in the animals' nesting chamber.

### Set the Hook

Fibekruk has lately ordered the faevlin to collect bones from humans living in the nearby villages. The characters have been hired by a local village to deal with the faevlin spotted in the area. Perhaps someone close to the characters has also been abducted, and the trail led here. If the characters are returning to the area after a long absence (perhaps after receiving training in a distant land), the ruined cottage could hold significance to one or more of them. Of course, it's also possible the characters simply run across the Bone House in their explorations.

## Lair Overview

The lair is described as it is during nighttime hours, when the faevlin do their best work. During the day, two sleepy faevlin stand watch with the knifewings while the rest of the faevlin sleep in their huts. The bone trader also rests during the day. The only light sources at night are the cooking fire in the faevlin camp and the braziers (kept burning constantly) in the bone manse. Otherwise, the forest and cavern are dark. Characters observing the scene see the faevlin eventually swap places or jobs, but other than the day-night crew change, the faevlin always divide into work crews.

Faevlin who encounter characters try to incapacitate characters rather than kill, hoping to offer them to Fibekruk. Even if all the characters are [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), it may not be the end of the adventure: set up a meeting between the characters and the bone trader. They can make a deal for their lives—though the cost should be suitably dark.

Dealing with the bone trader is making a proverbial deal with the devil: you likely get what you want in the here and now, with regrettable consequences down the line. For example, bone traders are willing to give up immediate gratification (snacking on a character or one of the character's NPC friends) in exchange for long-term satisfaction (such as a blood oath that the character will bring *two* humanoids for it to feast on before the next full moon). Captured characters unwilling or unable to make a deal may find themselves fed on, one at a time, over the next few days. Escape is always possible, of course!

### 1. Ruined Cabin

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rotting wooden bookcases, chairs, and a table are covered in damp moss. The southeast corner of the roof has collapsed, taking the nearby walls down with it. Three stout barrels rest in the northwest corner.
^00f

Two [faevlin](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/faevlin-ghloe.md)* are moving some new barrels into the cottage, one at a time, from outside. The bookshelves are empty, its items were moved to Fibekruk's bedroom (area 6). The barrels contain fresh water and pickles.

### 2. Faevlin Camp

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Six tiny huts, poorly constructed, are loosely spaced around a cooking fire among the trees.
^011

Two [faevlin](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/faevlin-ghloe.md)* are sleeping in separate huts. The cooking fire is burning low; it has not been attended for some time.

#### Gold Pouch

The faevlin have meaningless trinkets and talismans, but one of them had the guts to secret away 3 gp in a bladder hidden in the hay coating the floor of one of the huts.

### 3. Refuse Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A 15-foot-deep hole has been roughly dug out of the forest floor; the dirt removed from it sits in haphazard mounds nearby. The stench emanating from it identifies it as an outhouse and refuse pit.
^015

Two [faevlin](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/faevlin-ghloe.md)* were rooting around at the base of the pit for valuables when the stake they used to hold their rope snapped and left them stuck at the bottom. They have noticed this, but they're too busy hunting for gold to panic yet.

#### Treasure

One of their many now-boneless victims at the bottom of the pit carried a small leather purse with 9 gp inside. If the characters watch the faevlin search for more than 10 minutes, the faevlin find it. The characters can find it themselves with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

### 4. Knifewing Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large cavern smells of blood and refuse. Two piles of straw are placed opposite each other, and four rough metal cages are arrayed about the chamber. One end of the cavern opens into the forest, the other deeper into the cave.
^019

![Knifewing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/004-01-002.knifewing.webp#center)

Three [knifewings](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/knifewing-ghloe.md)* are sleeping lightly in their beds. They are friendly to the faevlin (if they've been fed) but are hostile to other creatures not escorted by either the bone trader or faevlin.

#### Cages

Two of the cages are empty and two contain sheep stolen from nearby farms. As GM, you may decide if any prisoners are trapped in the cages, such as villagers from the nearby town or an NPC the characters have been sent to find. If you need a default humanoid prisoner, use Dirk Wheatfield, a human farmer who made the mistake of investigating sounds in his barn the previous night before being beaten senseless and dragged here. He has 1 hp and is suffering a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). His left leg is missing its bones below the knee, hobbling him. Magical healing restores his ability to walk.

His cage can be broken open with a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or unlocked with a DC 10 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. If saved, he knows nothing about the interior of the Bone House but conveys that there are at least half a dozen faevlin in addition to the three knifewings and the bone trader. He refuses to go further inside and wishes to be taken home.

### 5. Bone Manse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large square pagoda has walls comprised of thousands of interlocking bones. Through the open doorway you can see a macabre set of chairs and a desk, also made of interwoven bones, crested with skulls of woodland creatures. A humanoid skull features prominently on the desk's center. Metal braziers built into the corners cast the space in flickering shadows.
^01d

By default, this space is empty, but if the characters have arranged a meeting with the bone trader, this is where he meets them—from behind his desk in his bone manse.

#### Unsettling Hollow

Between the bones and the "artwork," this space is designed to unsettle and disturb the bone trader's guests (or enemies). Charisma ability checks or saving throws made by humanoids other than Fibekruk and the faevlins suffer disadvantage while in this room.

#### Skull of Cohesion

Bones are notoriously difficult to bind together without copious binding agent. Most of the time, bone-builds are merely bone-accented! Skilled bone traders are capable of crafting a common magic item known as bones of cohesion, providing an aura of stability to structures in a 30 foot radius. This skull of cohesion lends its strength to the pagoda. If removed from the space (30 feet away from the structure), the pagoda collapses like a house of cards. Characters may use this item themselves to quickly set up or take down an encampment, but more usefully it makes donning (and subsequently doffing) armor a bit faster. Characters bearing the skull of cohesion may halve the time to don heavy armor and (if they set the skull no more than 30 feet away) halve the time to doff that same armor.

### 6. Bedroom and Showcase

![Bone Trader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/005-01-003.bone-trader.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Bones arranged in a herringbone pattern line the floor of this smooth-walled chamber. A canopied bed, framed paintings, and sturdy wardrobes furnish this otherworldly room. Three bony pedestals are each topped with a different skull—one large and tusked, one so tiny as to be awkward for the size of the pedestal, and one that is just the lower jawbone of a medium-sized creature.
^022

One [faevlin](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/faevlin-ghloe.md)* is busy polishing the tusked skull, a trade made by the bone trader some time ago. Even he does not recognize the creature from which it came. The [bone trader](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/bone-trader-ghloe.md)* fusses over the jawbone; it was once a fully intact skull, but Fibekruk has been stress-eating it, and the jawbone is all that remains. The tiny skull belonged to a fairy.

#### Wardrobes and Linens

The bone trader acquired its linens and the costumes in its wardrobes over several years. Most are beautiful, but fragile. Collected, the linens and clothes weigh around 30 pounds, are extremely bulky, and would be worth 20 gp to a collector. Traveling with them is likely to make them disintegrate: for each day a character moves the linens, roll a `d10`. On a roll of a 1, the linens are damaged beyond repair and become worthless. (Characters who have proficiency with a tailor's kit cope with the fragility and are not subject to the roll.)

#### Coin Purse

A search of the area with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals a section of the herringbone floor that doesn't match the pattern. Underneath is a small hollow where the bone trader hides the coins and other bargaining chips stolen or traded for from others. Its coffers are low, having recently acquired the tusked skull at a great price. Now, 5 gp and 49 sp are in the purse.

### 7. Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Stacks of bones of varying sizes have been meticulously organized and stacked into 6-and-7-foot square piles. Barrels, crates, jars of oils, foodstuffs, and sundries are marked with a variety of symbols belonging to farms and villages throughout the region.
^027

In addition to the bones, the other supplies are mostly kept by Fibekruk to feed itself and pacify the faevlin and knifewings, though it does occasionally offer to trade these supplies for more bones.

#### Sundry Supplies

If hauled back to civilization, most of these supplies can be returned to their original owners. If characters are willing to return the supplies, the villagers are extremely grateful and owe the characters a future favor. Alternately, the characters may sell the sundries, netting 15 gp profit. Moving this many barrels and crates requires a wagon or other means of overland transport.

## Conclusion

Lucky or particularly skilled characters who manage to kill, defeat, or otherwise drive off Fibekruk and its minions become folk heroes in the nearest village, gaining offers of free meals and lodging for the next two weeks in the village.

The characters may tussle with and eventually make a deal with the bone trader. Villagers don't usually have a lot of coin to use as payoff, so rewards they offer may be in information (perhaps leading to a new adventure) or admiration. If necessary, the villagers can give the characters 10 gp each to convince the bone trader to stop preying on them. This is reduced to 5 gp each if they are only able to convince the bone trader to agree not to hunt the people, leaving the animals as fair game. Obviously, if the characters make a deal that saves their own bones but doesn't account for nearby villages' needs, the villages won't pay them anything!

Dealing with the bone trader could be the first step toward helping a local ruler regain control of their fiefdom, leading the characters back to them for another quest against sinister forces in these lands. The bone trader may mention that its own actions are limited by an even greater bone trader in another vale—one who has several bone trader vassals of its own! Or, perhaps, the bone trader is annoyed because the characters have been sent in breach of an existing contract, and the next adventure for the characters investigates who sent them into a deadly situation to get rid of Fibekruk!
