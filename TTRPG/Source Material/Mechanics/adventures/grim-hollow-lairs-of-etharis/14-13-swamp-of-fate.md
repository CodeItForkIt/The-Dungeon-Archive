# 13: Swamp of Fate
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 53* 

*By Greg Marks*

Swamp of Fate is an ordeal tree lair for four or five 13th-level characters.

## Background

In times now forgotten, a small temple to Typharia, the goddess of truth, was raised on a series of small hills. Called Astranag, the holy shrine was a place of learning, focused on uncovering natural wonders and divining fate from the stars. After the God's End, the clear and fertile land about Astranag sank into more, and what was bright became foul. The burgeoning swamp swallowed most of the temple, and thick mists closed off the stars from sight. The place of clarity became obscured and forgotten by most until it was put to darker purpose.

What remains became the lair of an ordeal tree, a mystical evil plant that tempts the foolish with corrupted wishes. For decades, the ordeal tree has rested atop one of the few hills that rise out of the swamp, feasting on the foolish and granting power to those of the darkest hearts. The latest, a dark werebear known as Folmar Duskscape, has camped in the ruins. Folmar seeks to gain more and more power from the ordeal tree, but the tree taunts him. It granted him power once, but despite surviving the ordeal three times, his further pleas have gone unanswered. Folmar is systematically seeking loopholes in the mystical bargain.

His latest attempt is to [awaken](Mechanics/spells/awaken.md) animals and have them undergo the ordeal while under the effects of [dominate beast](Mechanics/spells/dominate-beast.md), such that they might wish for more power for him. None of the animals have survived or granted him power despite the promises of the ordeal tree. Hungry for power at any cost, Folmar is not ready to give up.

### Set the Hook

The characters hear tales of a mystical tree in the swamp that grants wishes to those judged worthy. Hoping to receive their hearts' desire, they set out on a quest to find the tree. After much research, the characters locate a map drawn by a madman guilty of a series of increasingly outlandish murders. The map depicts the location of the tree among the ruins of some place called Astranag. After traveling through a dangerous swamp, they come across the swamp.

#### Alternate Hook

Galia Feykin, a druid, has received a vision of a dryad in trouble. In her vision the dryad stands among the ruins of a temple sinking into a swamp, tears streaming down her face as a great shadow passes over her. The last thing she sees is the symbol of Typharia upon the temple's altar. Galia begs the characters to find this ancient temple and aid the dryad.

## Lair Overview

Several awakened animals patrol the ruins of Astranag. They are listed where they're most likely to lair, but they move about. A delicate treaty exists between three groups of animals, and the characters might be able to take advantage of this animosity when dealing with the inhabitants of the ruins.

In addition, the entire area is filled with a thick fog that "heavily obscures" all vision beyond 30 feet and "lightly obscures" everything within that radius.

### 1. The Hanging Tree

^2f5

Folmar has taken the bodies of several petitioners to the ordeal tree and hung them upon a large tree, hoping to distract or delay future visitors. The rotting meat frequently attracts many of the awakened animals who come to feast.

Yacka (awakened [giant ape](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-ape.md)) and Bludfeather (*awakened* [oozing vulture](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/oozing-vulture-ghloe.md)*) are most frequently found here. Neither has yet undergone the ordeal, and both are [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Folmar. The two have a wary truce and are considering joining together, particularly since they fear and dislike both Snapjaw (area 6) and the Hollow Sisters (area 3). Neither is especially hungry at the moment. If approached by adventurers, they try to convince them that this is the real ordeal tree and that to be judged worthy, they must bind themselves to it.

#### Hanging Tree

A massive, entirely natural tree grows on the island. Six humanoid bodies of various races hang from its branches, fraying weathered rope tied around their necks or waists. A successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes that the bodies appear to have been tied to the tree after they died from various forms of trauma and are unlikely to have bound themselves. All the bodies have been nibbled on since dying. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check notes that several of the bodies show damage from necrotic energy.

### 2. Standing Stones

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several standing stones crown a hill that rises steeply more than twenty feet out of the water.
^2f9

A natural observatory for stargazing, the island radiates a feeling of peace and calm which the *awakened* animals find repellant. The animals are never found here without being drawn here, making it the safest place to rest in Astranag.

#### Standing Stones

Each of the stones is covered in complicated scrollwork; many of the spirals have small holes carved into them. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check recognizes the patterns as the paths of planets and stars through the heavens, though in positions from long ago.

The stones radiate evocation magic. Anyone that completes a short or long rest within the circle heals an additional hit point per hit die spent, and any effect causing the creature to be [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) is suppressed while they remain within the circle. Once a creature benefits from the circle of standing stones, they cannot do so again until a new moon has passed.

### 3. Ruins of Astranag

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ruined stone walls, blocks of marble, and broken pillars dot this patch of dry land.
^2fd

The ruins of the temple proper stand on this rise. Weeds grow between the stones of a walkway that passes between broken pillars to a mostly intact temple. The Hollow Sister, a pack of seven awakened night wolves (treat as [winter wolves](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf.md), but they are Medium-sized, and replace their cold immunity and cold breath with necrotic) lair in the other ruined buildings. Folmar tried binding an entire pack of black-furred wolves to the ordeal tree. All the males died, but the females grew larger and more intelligent. Now calling themselves the Hollow Sisters, the pack has claimed the ruins of Astranag as their own. They are the most ardent supporters of Folmar and use their numbers to bully Yacka and Bludfeather while avoiding Snapjaw.

#### Ruins

The Hollow Sisters sleep in the ruins, now desecrated by the remains of other animals and humanoids they have partially eaten. The Hollow Sisters are cruel and torture their prey before consuming it. There are ample places one could hide and take cover.

#### Temple

At night, Folmar sleeps in the small temple to Typharia that is still mostly intact beyond a large hole in the roof. A plain room with a simple stone slab altar is all that remain of the former faith. The wall opposite the doors is badly chipped and damaged where Folmar has tried to desecrate Typharia's holy symbol. A [bedroll](Mechanics/items/bedroll.md) and [backpack](Mechanics/items/backpack.md) are behind the altar. In the backpack, beyond food and personal effects, is a pouch with 270 gp and an [elixir of health](Mechanics/items/elixir-of-health.md).

### 4. Wooded Hill

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dense group of trees top a small mound. The trees appear healthier than the other foliage you've seen.
^302

The [dryad](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) Dyssodia hides within her tree in the center of the small mound. Once a follower of Typharia and a scholar concerned with the movements of the night sky, the dryad has drowned in melancholy as the world slipped into darkness. When the ordeal tree first came to Astranag, she tried to warn visitors away, but inevitably they were drawn to the tree. Most died. Those that didn't possessed the darkest hearts, and Dyssodia knew they would further spread corruption. Tied to her tree, there is nowhere to go, so she simply watches corruption spread and despairs. She avoids visitors now, but if the characters can find her, or show true hearts when confronting Folmar and the ordeal tree, they might be able to coax her out to offer aid.

Neither Folmar nor the awakened animals know of her. The ordeal tree recognizes the dryad's tree, but with no mortal soul to corrupt and with her wallowing in sadness, it simply doesn't care.

### 5. The Ordeal Tree

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A massive hoary tree rises from the island. Its bark is scarred rope, spikes, and deep gashes.
^304

![Ordeal Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/094-13-002.ordeal-tree.webp#center)

The [ordeal tree](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/ordeal-tree-ghloe.md)* is rarely alone. Folmar Duskscape ([werebear ascetic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/werebear-ascetic-ghloe.md)*; the ordeal tree has given Folmar resistance to all damage) spends most of his time here in supplication or studying the tree, hoping to divine some way to gain more power. Between fits of coughing (from his curse of foul blight), he orders visitors to flee before he attacks them with his [staff of thunder and lightning](Mechanics/items/staff-of-thunder-and-lightning.md). If they refuse, he summons all the awakened animals that remain and launches his attack. The ordeal tree itself uses its heart sight on the characters. If they're more powerful and more flawed than Folmar, it waits for the druid's defeat so that it might curse the characters. If the adventurers are pure of heart, it joins Folmar when the party least expects it and tries to kill them. This emboldens Folmar, and he stops at nothing to murder the characters.

#### Sunken Boat

A foot of the rickety dock is a sunken boat that succumbed to Snapjaw's attack. While the passengers have been eaten, a chest has gone unnoticed in the remains. Inside the locked (DC 20) chest is the treasure a group of mercenaries had intended to offer the ordeal tree in exchange for power: 1,000 gp, a goat's horn with the blasphemous names of daemons carved into it, and a [ring of free action](Mechanics/items/ring-of-free-action.md) that is cursed to bring misfortune to the wearer.

### 6. Shallows

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The water is shallow enough between the hills that you can see the bottom in some places and possibly walk across.
^308

The shallows are the domain of [Snapjaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/snapjaw-ghloe.md), an awakened [giant crocodile](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md). Snapjaw buries itself in the mud and watches, occasionally feasting on something that draws too close. Only Folmar need not fear the crocodile, though as Folmar's first experiment, the druid's charm has worn off and the crocodile merely tolerates the werebear now. Most of the time Snapjaw sleeps or waits, but if hungry, it rouses to feast. When buried in the mud of the shallows, a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check or comparable passive Perception is needed to distinguish Snapjaw from the surrounding foliage and debris. The ordeal tree's blessing has made Snapjaw as large as its hunger. Snapjaw is a gargantuan giant crocodile with double hit points, +3 AC, +3 to hit, +10 damage on all attacks, and gains an additional bite attack when using Multiattack).

The shallows range from 3 to 15 feet deep and are "difficult terrain" for anyone walk across.

## Conclusion

If Folmar and his animals are defeated, the characters can choose to undergo the ordeal, but it most likely leads to death at the hands of the ordeal tree, one way or another. Any boons granted by the ordeal tree fade once the tree is destroyed, and only by destroying the tree can the world be made safer.

If the ordeal tree is defeated, Dyssodia comes forth, grateful for the weight lifted from her heart. She sets about restoring the ruins, though Typharia no longer speaks to her. The dryad may become a great font of knowledge for the party, particularly about history from before the God's End or about the stars and the natural world. If the party aids her in restoring her home, she considers them friends and allow them to visit when they have need of her.

Followers of the Arch Seraph Zabriel and the Arch Daemon Venin would be greatly interested in the ruins, and in particular, the standing stones that retain a fragment of divine power. Protecting, or selling, the location may lead to future adventures.
