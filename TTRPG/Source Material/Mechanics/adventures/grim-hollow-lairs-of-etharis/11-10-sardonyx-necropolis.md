# 10: Sardonyx Necropolis
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 41* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Sardonyx Necropolis is a corpse walker lair for four or five 10th-level characters.

## Background

At the height of this city's glory and power, a necropolis was built below the streets to commemorate the city's honored war-dead and the general who valorously led their forces before falling in battle. Over time, as the city's power began to wane, the necropolis was sealed and forgotten.

Now, as the city's future is uncertain, a young and ambitious necromancer has rediscovered the Sardonyx Necropolis, so named for the rare and precious red and white marble and gemstones decorating the central mausoleum. In his quest to enhance his city's power, the necromancer began animating the dead, whose corpses have lain undisturbed for so long. Unfortunately for him, his power was insufficient to control them, and now the city above is attacked each night by bands of roving undead soldiers wearing, horrifically enough, the tattered remnants of the city's own uniforms from its glory days.

### Set the Hook

As the city panics, the characters are brought in to deal with the threat. The city's leadership has been reminded of the Sardonyx Necropolis's existence, but the city's watch has its hands full guarding the sewers, caves, and basements where the undead have broken through to the surface. Adventurers are needed to descend to the necropolis, destroy the undead, and stop whoever is causing the problem.

Alternatively, the necropolis may still be sealed, but important people (perhaps including the characters) are receiving horrifying visions of the dead rising from their graves and destroying the city. The visions all end with an image of a red-and-white stone structure embossed with sardonyx stones. Research in the city library reveals the existence of the necropolis, and the characters must go there to confront the source of the visions before the worst comes to pass. If your adventures have taken your characters far from any city, feel free instead to put this necropolis above the first level of a dungeon or just below a ruined wilderness temple.

## Lair Overview

The necropolis is underground, where natural light never penetrates. While there are torch sconces and braziers for oil spread throughout the area, none are stocked. Characters who put torches in the sconces or oil in the braziers and light them draw the undead like moths to a flame. Clever characters may use this strategy to draw undead where they want them, but since the dead are drawn to the light, they may get more than they bargain for! Descriptions assume the characters have some way to see but not necessarily in color.

Without a necromancer controlling them, most of the dead are listless; they "patrol" a small area around their graves but lack a sense of past or future that would cause them to change that routine without outside stimuli. If using the city-under-siege model, the characters should not have time to descend at night but should be strongly encouraged to enter during the day. If they spend too long, the corpse walkers gather the undead hordes and lead them to the surface to pillage and destroy—possibly creating even more undead—before returning to the necropolis.

### 1. Cobblestone Walkway

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The natural caverns you've traversed give way to precisely worked cobblestones, a twenty-foot-wide road leading to an enormous stone structure, studded with gemstones, that is covered in angular depictions of soldiers drilling, angels floating, and families crying. Gravestones are spaced to the north and south.
^23a

Characters enter the necropolis from this location. Characters who choose to approach quietly and without a light source can enter and move about unmolested if they succeed at a group DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. Those using a light source or failing to move quietly draw undead from area 7. Those who use light are able to see the stone structure to the east is red and white, confirming its identity.

#### Sardonyx Gemstones

Though the structure is magnificent, some expense was spared in its construction: only one in every 10 gemstones that sparkle on the structure are real sardonyx, worth 50 gp each. The rest are colored glass baubles. Characters proficient with jeweler's tools or glassblower's tools notice the difference immediately if attempting to remove one from the wall; otherwise, there is only a 10 percent chance that a given gemstone is real. There are 100 stones across each of the three entrances to the necropolis's main structure, 10 of which are real in each case. Prying a stone from the wall takes 5 minutes and an appropriate tool (such as a crowbar or piton and hammer). Glass fakes shatter after a minute of attempted extraction.

#### Graves

Gravestones and crypt niches throughout have a first initial of a first name, first three letters of a last name, and a rank abbreviation inscribed on them. They are made of white stone and sanded or filed smooth but not shiny.

### 2. Angel of Health

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An angelic statue holding a staff in one hand and a chalice upraised in the other watches over the graves in this area. A spongy fungus grows over the base of the statue and over many of the graves in this area.
^23f

No creatures threaten the characters here, but the "fungus" hides a danger. The soldiers buried here died from disease they brought home from battle, not from battle wounds.

#### Angel of Health

The statue depicts Julara, an angel of health and former servant of Aurelia (now an ally of Miklas). Characters who clear off the fungus from the base of the statue discover a plate inscribed with the following prayer: "Julara, angel of health, protect us from disease and death." The blessing of Julara is potent: cleaning the statue grants characters who participate in the cleaning advantage on saves against disease while in the necropolis.

#### Spongy Fungus

Closer inspection (and knowledge) can reveal that what appears to be fungus is really a yellow, disease-bearing moss. Druids and those proficient with [Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine) automatically recognize it. Others must succeed at a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check to discern that the spongy stuff is really moss infected with the Weeping Pox. Physical contact with the moss is sufficient to spread it (though if this contact is in service of cleaning the statue, the character gains advantage on their checks against the disease!).

### 3. Unmarked Mausoleum

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This gated and walled mausoleum bears no identifying markers.
^244

One of the general's humbler lieutenants requested an unmarked grave, but the people couldn't bear the thought of not honoring him; the compromise was this unmarked but magnificent mausoleum. Characters can climb the walls, unlock the gate with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check, or use another means to get to the door of the mausoleum proper.

#### Riddle of the Mausoleum

The door has no handle or keyhole but bears a riddle in archaic Celestial: "If thou art better, thou dost not possess me; yet they who do art the best of men. I am never shouted, often overlooked, and cannot be bragged of. Speak my name and enter." The best answer to the riddle is "humility," but "humble," "meek," "modest," or some other similar trait works as well. Players who struggle with riddles can still gain access if a character makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

#### Inside

This tomb's interior contains a simple stone platform where a corpse in tarnished armor reposes. Gleaming in his hands is a [+1 greataxe](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) that, when attuned, gives the wielder a +2 bonus to initiative checks.

### 4. Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A towering obelisk shaped like a saber looms over the graves here.
^249

One [corpse walker](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/corpse-walker-ghloe.md)* and eight [skeleton riflers](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton-rifler-ghloe.md)* lurk in the dark. They attack living creatures on sight.

#### Obelisk

The obelisk bears a simple inscription in Higher Bürach: "By our lives have we secured yours."

### 5. Crypt Niches

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> These dense crypt niches are stacked from the floor to the ceiling in two rows beside the central tomb and a smaller mausoleum.
^24d

![Corpse Walker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/075-10-001.corpse-walker.webp#center)

The floor here is made of smoother, red pavers compared to the white cobblestones of the road.

#### Crypt Niches

The niches have not yet been defiled or destroyed. The remains inside repose peacefully. Even a systematic search of the niches (which requires breaking their seals or smashing them open) reveals nothing of value interred with the corpses.

### 6. Statue of Lady Gilrain

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A life-size statue of an armored woman wielding a blade guards these graves.
^251

Lady Gilrain died leading her troops in battle, one of the only nobles to lead from the front. Her remains were never recovered, but her sword found its way back to friendly hands and is held by her statue.

#### Gilrain's Blade

Characters with a passive Perception of at least 13 or who succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, recognize that the sword itself is metal (not stone) and removable. It is a [+1 longsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md).

### 7. Assorted Graves

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Scattered gravestones, precisely planned and placed, mark the resting places of the fallen.
^255

A pair of [corpse walker](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/corpse-walker-ghloe.md)* trundle through these graves looking for other undead agents. They attack on sight.

> [!quote]  
> 
> These dense crypt niches are stacked from the floor to the ceiling in two rows beside the central tomb and a smaller mausoleum.

### 8. General's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A simple wooden box, mostly rotted, sits on a stone pedestal in the center of this mausoleum. The lid is askew. A man wearing a once-fine but now-bloodied cloak stands over the coffin, unmoving.
^257

The general's spirit is long gone, but when the necromancer who raised the first corpse walkers and skeleton soldiers came to raise the general's body, the magics protecting the tomb severed his control over his undead minions. They slaughtered him. He is now a single mindless [zombie](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), doomed to stand watch over the tomb he tried to defile. Characters who call out to him get no response, and any who approach him realize he's a zombie. If they move to interact with the coffin, he attacks; he similarly defends himself if attacked from range.

#### Noise

Loud combat or opening the general's coffin draws the creatures from area 9.

#### General's Coffin

The coffin is behind bars that stretch to the ceiling, but the necromancer's zombified corpse is not. Getting inside the bars and opening the general's coffin unleashes a wave of potent disruptive magic on anyone or anything standing inside the interior walls containing area 8: spellcasters concentrating on spells automatically lose their concentration. Magical effects granted by potions or spells immediately end. Summoned creatures are banished. If the lid is replaced, the effect can be repeated after 24 hours. The general's corpse is skeletal and his clothes colorless and crumbling; nothing of value remains.

#### The Zombie

Unlike the other undead and corpses in the necropolis, the zombie's clothes are modern, and though torn and ripped are reasonably new. A pin bearing a seal of office marks him as a low-level bureaucrat in the city above.

### 9. Destroyed Crypts

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This half of the mausoleum has been utterly destroyed. What were once row upon row of crypt niches have been pulverized. The corpses within are missing, but the musty dust of the crypt has settled over the copious debris.
^25d

An [ancient corpse walker](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ancient-corpse-walker-ghloe.md)* and a [skeleton commander](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton-commander-ghloe.md)* are here and attack on sight.

#### Untouched Mausoleum

At the southwest end of area 9 is a mausoleum with double doors. This is where the ancient corpse walker retreats to if defeated (and where it can ultimately be destroyed). The doors are generally closed but unlocked. Inside the characters find cast off armor including [gauntlets of ogre power](Mechanics/items/gauntlets-of-ogre-power.md).

#### Rough Terrain

The floor in this area is "difficult terrain".

### 10. Niches & Mosaic

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Densely stacked crypt niches reach to the ceiling along the western and northern walls. The eastern side of this area has been repeatedly smashed with something large and heavy, but it's clear that once these were more crypt niches too. Beyond the niches to the east, a twenty-foot-diameter floor mosaic of a radiant, angelic figure is visible in the gloom.
^262

One of the dead bodies from the niches has found itself flung onto the mosaic, but otherwise most of the debris is far from it. The mosaic was under the influence of a [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) spell that kept out the corpse walkers and other undead, but when the necromancer opened the general's coffin in area 8, it destroyed the effect. The undead still shy from this area, however.

#### Niche Search

The destroyed niches have been looted, but the sealed ones have not. A thorough, systematic search of these niches (which requires breaking their seals and/or smashing them open) reveals one of the soldiers was interred with an outer garment that hasn't succumbed to time: a [cloak of elvenkind](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-elvenkind.md).

## Conclusion

Destroying the corpse walkers and their skeletal legion marks the conclusion of the characters' journey to the Sardonyx Necropolis. Who was the lone zombie before he was turned into an undead puppet? Have some undead already escaped to wreak havoc and raise more undead legions elsewhere?

Now that the immediate danger posed by the corpse walkers is vanquished, some powerful figures in the city above might be upset that the characters slew them rather than tamed them or turned them against the enemies of the city. Others will cry "desecration!" after learning that these creatures were once revered soldiers and leaders from the city's glorious past. This adventure can easily lead to intrigue in the city above as the characters defend their actions and the enemies of the city (both within and without) make their move!
