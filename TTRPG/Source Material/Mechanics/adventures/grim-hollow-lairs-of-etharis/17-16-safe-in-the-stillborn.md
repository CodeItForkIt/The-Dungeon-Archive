# 16: Safe in the Stillborn
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 65* 

*By Shawn Merwin*

Safe in the Stillborn is a hraptnon lair for four or five 16th-level characters.

## Background

A downcast apostate called Master Krumm wanted to become immortal again, and he planned to perform dark rituals to make that happen. After being driven away from two different lairs by interfering adventurers, he sought a place where no one would bother him: the Stillborn Forest. Krumm found abandoned lodgings upon which to build his new home, including a small manor and a house for servants. Within a month, Krumm and his followers had created a well for water, a garden for food, abundant game for meat, and Krumm knew privacy like they never had before.

Once established in their new dwellings, Krumm's entourage scoured their area of the forest, finding a few woodcutters, hunters, and scouts. Krumm and his lackeys captured these folks in preparation to attempt yet another ritualistic sacrifice to reestablish Krumm's immortality.

All seemed well for Krumm's plan until some roving xakalonuses noticed the new settlement. Krumm repelled their first attack, although they destroyed the home of his servants and many of the trees in the area. The xakalonuses can smell the delicious, magic-infused brain of the downcast apostate, and they know it will make a wonderful meal for their progenitor, the hraptnon.

When the characters arrive at the lair, they find themselves caught in the middle of an ongoing struggle between Master Krumm and several xakalonuses, with the hraptnon about to arrive on the scene to take what it feels belongs to it: the life of any living creature in the Stillborn Forest.

### Set the Hook

A small but thriving hamlet called Oakendale rests at the edge of the Stillborn Forest. It acts as a gathering point for those brave souls who ply their trade in the forest as woodcutters, loggers, hunters, and treasure seekers. The leader of the town, a woman named Yvell Stowin, oversees the mercantile businesses that operate in and through Oakendale, acting as a de facto guildmistress. When many more foresters than normal fail to return from their work in a timely manner, Yvell reaches out to adventurers to enter the dangerous forest and see what the problem might be.

Yvell can provide a map of the main logging roads at the edges of the forest, showing the area that supplies Oakendale with its resources. (Krumm's new estate rests one of those logging roads, and Yvell is unaware of its presence.) She can also regale the adventurers with the legend of the hraptnon, which contains an interesting mixture of truth and wild speculation. Discerning which of these tales are true and which are false is up to the characters.

Yvell can truthfully avow to an increase in sightings of creatures called xakalonuses in the area in the last several days. These creatures are very dangerous, but the local militia is experienced at driving away threats. The only time a xakalonus didn't flee after taking some heavy longbow fire was when there was a mage in town doing research on the hraptnon. In that case, the xakalonuses did not retreat until one of them had attacked the mage, ripping off the top of his head and eating his brain. Yvell offers the characters a total of 500 gp to put an end to the attacks and find the cause of the missing foresters.

#### Alternate Hook

Xakalonus attacks have increased dramatically all over Etharis, with most of those attacks happening against people who use magic. After attacking magic-users and eating their brains, the xakalonuses immediately retreat. More than one report has pointed to the Stillborn Forest as the ultimate destination of these brain-eating creatures, so the characters are prompted to investigate.

## Lair Overview

The Stillborn Forest is thick with trees, underbrush, wild game, and even some lesser fey creatures. Moving off established paths means entering "difficult terrain", and the countless trees offer much concealment and cover from ranged attacks.

### 1. Logging Road

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thick, luxuriously leafed oak and pine trees teem in this area of the Stillborn Forest. As you travel, however, you notice some changes: the trees on one side of the road thin out a bit, where they appear sickly and stripped of leaves. Fewer forest-dwelling creatures chitter at you from their dens and perches. Felled logs form a rough barrier on each side of the path, slowing plant growth over the path.
> 
> In the distance, on either side of the path, are a pair of wooden structures. Although they are difficult to see through the thick foliage, you can discern a few details. The structure to the west of the path, on the same side as the sickly trees, has obviously sustained structural damage. The structure on the eastern side of the path is in better shape.
^38f

The characters get a better view only if they approach or use magic. The current lull in the battle between Krumm's contingent and the xakalonuses means there's nothing to hear from the road.

#### Tracks

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check identifies tracks of Medium-sized and booted humanoid creatures, along with some domesticated animals like horses. More recent tracks to and from the area were made by xakalonuses, which look like large wolf tracks but with much sharper claws.

#### Corrupted Foliage

If the characters take a moment to examine the corrupted trees along the west of the path, they can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. On a success, they learn that these trees were at one point magical, infused with a type of fey magic. Something drained the magic from them, leaving them alive but severely damaged.

The magic of the trees was drained by the presence of the xakalonuses as they moved through the area recently. Unless the characters have explicit knowledge of the xakalonus, however, they have no way of knowing their presence was the cause of this corruption of the trees. However, when the characters see magic fail to affect those creatures, they might figure it out.

#### Lurking Monsters

Two sets of five [xakalonuses](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/xakalonus-ghloe.md)* each wait to the north and south of the Krumm's Manor (Area 3). They watch the situation, waiting for the hraptnon to arrive and take part in a final assault against the occupants of the manor. The characters' presence throws their plan into question. If the characters notice either of these sets of monsters and attack, the group of xakalonuses they attack defends themselves.

The other group of creatures lingers, waiting to see what happens next. They may be tempted to join any fracas between the characters and Krumm's entourage (see Area 3).

### 2. Destroyed Dwelling

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The outer walls and foundation of this dwelling are cracked, the glass windows shattered and the doors torn from their hinges. Three human corpses litter the lawn outside the house.
^395

This building housed Krumm's mundane servants: cooks, farmers, animal keepers, etc. They locked themselves in the building when the xakalonuses attacked, but the monsters entered the building and killed everyone inside, chasing down those who attempted to flee.

#### Building

A character succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check determines that while it looks like the damage to the building was caused by an earthquake, the damage is too localized and specific. Highly concentrated thunder damage was the cause of the damage to the building.

#### Corpses

The three corpses in the front lawn belonged to members of Master Krumm's staff: a cook, a farmer, and a woodcutter. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check determines that the bodies where slain by claws and bites from a rather larger creature. On the body of the cook is a key, which opens the back door of Krumm's manor.

#### Survivor

Inside the house are more corpses like the ones in the front yard. They bear the same wounds as well, although some of the bodies were killed by thunder damage. [Unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) but stable, hidden by an overturned mattress, is a stable hand, a young human named Feder Estes. If roused from his current state, Feder speaks only Ostoyan and has little information to impart, save for the following:

- In the last two months, Krumm and his staff of about 20 people created this small settlement. Most of the staff is now dead in the servants' dwelling. Krumm paid well but insisted on secrecy, insisting that Feder tell no one where he was going or who he was serving.  
- They were attacked today by large wolf-like creatures lacking hair. Their howls shattered windows and buckled doors.  
- Krumm is probably in his manor house, assuming he survived the attack. The Master is a powerful arcanist who sought this remote place to perform his research.  
- [A successful DC 20 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check is needed to prompt the following information.] The staff catches glimpses of strange creatures (the [chapped brutes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chapped-brute-ghloe.md)) moving through the woods, and in and out of the manor house late at night. Occasionally a scream is heard from the manor as well, but no one is brave enough to ask questions or investigate.  

### 3. Krumm's Estate

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Unlike the other building, this one is still intact. The bodies of several creatures, looking like some sort of wolf-lizard hybrid, lie dead around the house's perimeter. There are no signs of life within or outside the house.
^39b

![Awakened Chapped Brute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/114-16-001.awakened-chapped-brute.webp#center)

Master Krumm ([downcast apostate](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/downcast-apostate-ghloe.md)*) is locked within his home, waiting for the next barrage from the xakalonuses. He is unaware of the presence of the hraptnon nearby, although he knows of its mythical existence and fears that if it attacks, he and his bodyguards won't be able to withstand the assault. Those bodyguards are five [awakened chapped brutes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/awakened-chapped-brute-ghloe.md)*, who currently hide in the woods behind the manor, awaiting the call of their master.

#### Krumm's Motivation

Master Krumm's rituals to regain his immortality failed for one simple reason: none of his sacrifices were powerful enough in spirit or magic to ignite the divine spark in him. With the characters, he sees several potential sparks. This leaves him in a quandary: he may need the characters to help hold off further attacks, but if he can kill one to complete the ritual, he can regain immortality, so defending against the attack won't matter.

#### The Manor

The manor is full of Krumm's personal items, as well as tomes on rituals that could return immortality to once-immortal creatures. Components for those rituals are stored throughout the manor and could be sold for 1,500 gp to the right buyer. In the shed near the garden, three bound woodcutters await their fate as sacrifices to Krumm's ritual.

### Hrapton's Advance

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/115-16-002.hrapton.webp#center)

Whenever you feel is the best time to throw the entire situation into even more chaos, unleash the [hraptnon](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/hraptnon-ghloe.md)*!

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A horrifying creature the size of a house smashes through the forest, uprooting trees and roaring out a challenge.
^3a0

When the hraptnon arrives, its instinct is to target the creature wielding the strongest magical ability. That is likely Master Krumm, who's an 18th-level spellcaster. However, the creature may go after a more accessible target who is almost as powerful.

If the hraptnon is being easily handled by the characters, a squad of five [xakalonuses](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/xakalonus-ghloe.md) enters the fray to support their progenitor. They can act as a buffer, or the hraptnon can devour them to regain hit points.

## Conclusion

If what could turn into a three-way battle results in the characters' victory, they learn that the foresters' disappearance was caused by both the hraptnon and xakalonuses, as well as the machinations of Master Krumm. Bringing Krumm back to Oakendale for justice settles the affair in the eyes of Yvell, who gratefully provides the promised reward.

Unfortunately for the characters, unless they find the hraptnon's magical Stillborn Heart at the grove in the center of the Stillborn Forest, a new hraptnon appears within 24 hours of the original's demise. It is likely that the new hraptnon gathers a large force of xakalonuses, and maybe some other deadly forest creatures, and assaults Oakendale directly, hoping to gorge on the brains of any arcane characters.
