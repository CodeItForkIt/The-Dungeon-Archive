# 20: Top of the World
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 81* 

*By Shawn Merwin*

Top of the World is Gegazol's lair for four or five 20th-level characters.

## Background

The undead dragon known as Gegazol inhabits an infamous lair in the frozen north of Etharis, but it's also saddled with a corrupting link to a daemonic force that resides within its undead body. Gegazol is normally content to rest in its home for decades at a time before its bloodlust encourages it to gather an army and march upon the Valikan Clans.

The daemonic skull that infuses Gegazol with extra abilities has a sentience of its own, and it has plans. If Gegazol can rule the northern realms of Etharis, she can certainly rule the entirety of this worldâ€”and possibly other worlds as well. The daemonic entity has nudged Gegazol to leave her lair and take some steps to gain even more power, as well as look to spread that power into other realms.

An elemental pocket dimension floats through the universe, coming into contact with many worlds. The pocket dimension roils with elemental energy, and if someone can tap into these elemental wellsprings, they could learn to control the very elements themselves. And this is just what Gegazol's daemonic inner voice is pushing her to do.

Gegazol has spent months in this elemental pocket dimension, absorbing the elements and attuning to the magical obelisks.

### Set the Hook

An enormous purple whirlpool of air and ether opens high above five of the largest cities of the world. While nothing has emerged from these whirlpools in the sky, the leaders of the world are naturally worried. The heroes of the world who've flown up and entered the whirlpool have not returned, except for the occasional corpses that plummet from the sky, scarred and maimed with elemental damage.

With the powers-that-be of the world running out of options, they turn to the most powerful and experienced adventurers in the world. They implore the characters to investigate any of these whirlpools. They can't promise the characters anything that the characters don't already have or can't obtain as level 20 characters, but use your imaginations to see what can tempt them.

If the characters fail to act in a timely matter, they wake up one morning to the horrible truth that every creature in the world is slowly being drained of power. (At sundown each evening, each creature loses one hit point from its maximum hit points, dying when their maximum reaches zero.) All signs point to the sources of this energy drain coming from the holes in the sky.

## Lair Overview

This lair is not on this world, or really on any world. It's a realm between worlds, an elemental pocket dimension that Gegazol has taken the time to attune with. To defeat Gegazol and drive her away from this place and back to her own lair, they must first sever the connection between the undead dragon and the obelisks. Four smaller obelisks surround a larger central one.

### Lair Actions

The lair actions for [Gegazol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/gegazol-ghloe.md) in *Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire* represent her abilities when she is at her frozen lair in Etharis. She has attuned to the power of the elemental pockets dimension, giving her these new lair actions instead.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gegazol takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Gegazol can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Geysers of elemental power burst from each of the obelisks. Each living creature not allied with Gegazol in the lair must attempt a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 27 (`6d8`) damage. The damage taken is of the type corresponding to the nearest obelisk. This damage ignores resistance or immunity.  
- Gegazol screeches, and the plateaus respond. Creatures in the lair must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail and are in contact with the ground take 18 (`4d8`) force damage and are [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 21). On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled). Those who are not in contact with the ground may succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be pulled to the nearest spot on the ground.  
- Gegazol summons an elemental storm that affects the entire lair. The entire lair becomes "difficult terrain" for enemies of Gegazol. In addition, enemies of Gegazol must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or gain a level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) until Gegazol uses a different lair action. While the storm is raging, Gegazol's fly speed doubles.  

### Lich trolls, Plateaus, and Obelisks

In her attempt to tame and control the elemental power of this pocket dimension, Gegazol has recruited four [lich trolls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich-troll-ghloe.md) to her cause. Each of the lich trolls are spiritually connected to one of the four smaller elemental obelisks, while Gegazol is connected to the larger central obelisk.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/143-20-002.lich-troll.webp#center)

The magic that binds all the creatures and elemental obelisks together is complex and intertwined. A lich troll cannot be killed until its associated elemental obelisk is powered down, and Gegazol cannot be killed until all four of the lich trolls are killed. This means none of the creatures can be reduced to less than 1 hit point.

The lich trolls cannot leave the plateau containing the obelisk they are connected to, but Gegazol is free to fly and move anywhere in the lair. While on the plateau with the obelisk that it's connected to, the spells it cast can be changed to do the corresponding damage instead of the spells normal damage. Additionally, when this happens, you should roll one extra damage die for the spell, and eliminate the low die. Each lich troll is also immune to the damage type of its associated obelisk. This immunity ends if the obelisk is deactivated.

If someone is pushed off any of the plateaus and have no way to fly or slow their descent, they fall thousands of feet to the ground of their home world.

### Bridges

Rope bridges connect the plateaus to each other. These bridges aren't sturdy, but they hold up under heavy use. They are immune to elemental damage (fire, cold, thunder, lightning, force), but can be easily damaged with other types of damage. They have 20 hit points and an armor class of 15.

## Arrival

As the characters move through the maelstrom in the sky, they are teleported to a random plateau. Roll `1d4` to see which plateau each character appears on.

### 1. Thunder Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The obelisk on this plateau ripples with an internal energy that causes the monolith to quake and quiver. A troll-like creature standing near the base of the obelisk rumbles and trembles with barely contained fury.
^46f

The [lich troll](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich-troll-ghloe.md)* connected to the thunder obelisk radiates tremors as it moves, and its voice rumbles with power.

#### Thunder Obelisk

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that this obelisk is associated with thunder. To deactivate the obelisk and sever it from connection to the lich troll and Gegazol, the characters must make the following steps. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check tells a character what these steps are, and what order they must be done in.

- Someone must touch the obelisk while casting a spell that does thunder damage, or attack the obelisk with thunder damage.  
- The obelisk is covered with runes, and one of the runes is associated with a divine entity representing thunder. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) notices this rune seems to be powering this obelisk.  
- If this rune is struck with a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, or 20 points of bludgeoning damage is done to that spot in a single blow, the obelisk cracks and loses its power. A character failing to break the obelisk on a single check takes 33 (`6d10`) thunder damage.  

### 2. Ice Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The obelisk on this plateau creaks and moans as an icy rime continually shifts on its surface. A troll-like creature covered with icy shards stalks the plateau.
^473

The [lich troll](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich-troll-ghloe.md)* connected to the ice obelisk is covered is sharp and frigid ice fragments, and frosty air puffs from its mouth when it speaks.

#### Ice Obelisk

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that this obelisk is associated with cold. To deactivate the obelisk and sever it from connection to the lich troll and Gegazol, the characters must make the following steps. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check tells a character what these steps are, and what order they must be done in.

- Someone must touch the obelisk while casting a spell that does cold damage, or attack the obelisk with cold damage.  
- A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) recognizes the pattern of icy veins running through the obelisk that carries the power through it.  
- A character who wants to depower the obelisk must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw to pull the icy veins apart. When that happen, the obelisk's icy surface melts and it loses its power. A creature failing the save takes 33 (`6d10`) cold damage and must let go before breaking the icy pillar.  

### 3. Flame Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The obelisk on this plateau is covered with small tongues of flickering flame. A troll-like creature covered with wearing cloaks of flame struts across the plateau.
^477

The [lich troll](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich-troll-ghloe.md)* connected to the flame obelisk is wreathed with flames, and noxious smoke escapes its lips when it speaks.

#### Flame Obelisk

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that this obelisk is associated with fire. To deactivate the obelisk and sever it from connection to the lich troll and Gegazol, the characters must make the following steps. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check tells a character what these steps are, and what order they must be done in.

- Someone must touch the obelisk while casting a spell that does fire damage, or attack the obelisk with fire damage.  
- A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks reveals that there is a fire opal within the fiery obelisk that powers it.  
- If this gem can be plucked out from between the intense flames with a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, the obelisk's flames are snuffed and the magic of the obelisk ends. If this check is failed, the person attempting the checks takes 33 (`6d10`) fire damage.  

### 4. Lightning Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The obelisk on this plateau flickers as waves of bluish energy coruscate over its surface. A troll-like creature consumed in garments of static electricity howls in anticipation.
^47b

The [lich troll](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich-troll-ghloe.md)* connected to the lightning obelisk crackles with blue static, and the wiry hair that covers its body stands on end.

#### Lightning Obelisk

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that this obelisk is associated with lightning. To deactivate the obelisk and sever it from connection to the lich troll and Gegazol, the characters must make the following steps. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check tells a character what these steps are, and what order they must be done in.

- Someone must touch the obelisk while casting a spell that does lightning damage, or attack the obelisk with lightning damage.  
- A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) finds a revolving metal rod that moves within the obelisk.  
- This rod can be grabbed and removed by a dexterous character who succeeds on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. Removing the rod breaks the magic of the obelisk. On a failed saving throw, the character takes 33 (`6d10`) lightning damage.  

### 5. Central Obelisk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An obelisk, larger and taller than the other four, dominates a plateau that rises 100 feet above the others. Dozens of corpses and cast off armor and weapons litter the ground all around this plateau. Perched atop the central pillar is an enormous draconic figure, but its body and wings show signs of rot and decay.
^47f

[Gegazol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/gegazol-ghloe.md)* resides on her perch. As soon as the characters appear, she moves to attack whoever looks vulnerable.

#### Main Obelisk

This pillar is empowered by the smaller ones. As soon as the other pillars are deactivated, this one crumbles, making Gegazol able to be killed. Until that happens, no attack can reduce Gegazol to less than 1 hit point.

## Conclusion

Gegazol can't be killed permanently until the daemonic skull is destroyed, and since the skull is not here, Gegazol reforms back in her icy home. And she will not be pleased at what the characters did to her. Revenge becomes foremost on her mind.
