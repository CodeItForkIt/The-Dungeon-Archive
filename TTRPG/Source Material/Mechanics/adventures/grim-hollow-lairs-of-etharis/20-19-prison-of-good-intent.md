# 19: Prison of Good Intent
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 77* 

*By Shawn Merwin*

Prison of Good Intent is an angel of Empyreus lair for four or five 19th-level characters.

## Background

The ancient elven vampire Aeilidrania terrorized communities around the world, gathering power, influence, information, and followersâ€”and built a small undead fiefdom for herself. When the vampire was at the height of her power, an angel of Empyreus named Benitent swooped in and captured her. It dragged the powerful undead creature to a remote prison, far from any civilized areas that she might threaten.

Unable to kill Aeilidrania permanently and fearing she would simply escape if he destroyed her current form, Benitent secured the vampire in a magical dwelling on an island surrounded by an abjuration-powered moat. The vampire's many followers have scoured the world, looking for a way to rescue their absent master, but only a few have managed to find this area. They cannot, however, breach the moat and the bridge, so they hurl themselves ineffectively at the barrier, all the while trying to think of other ways to free their mistress.

Benitent is only able to keep this prison intact through the power of a mortal being. Fearing that bringing any living creature into the prison area might give the vampire someone to manipulate, the angel of Empyreus employed a blind and deaf caretaker named Habret to live on the island, taking care of pigs and living in a small house.

For her part, Aeilidrania has given up attempting to escape. She's formed a friendship with the old caretaker, sharing with him much of the knowledge and wisdom she's gathered across the many centuries of her unlife. She also has enacted plans to corrupt Benitent, tricking the single-focused angel of Empyreus into unconsciously doing her bidding even while she remains its prisoner.

It's into the precariously balanced situation that the characters thrust themselves.

### Set the Hook

A world-threatening problem is rapidly hurtling toward the characters, and one piece of information they need to fight it rests firmly in the twisted but brilliant mind of the elven vampire Aeilidrania. After some research and investigation, they hear rumors that the vampire they seek lives in a secluded region far from any civilized areas. Whether or not they learn of the vampire's imprisonment by Benitent, the angel of Empyreus, depends on how much research they undertake and how many resources they use. With no other means of securing the information they need to deal with the incredible threat, the characters are forced to seek out Aeilidrania.

## Lair Overview

Benitent has taken steps to protect the area from magical incursion. Attempts to teleport directly into the area fail, displacing the teleporting party into the wilderness a couple of miles from this site, forcing them to use more conventional means of transportation. Within the bounds of the magical moat, the following effects hold sway:

- Creatures (except Benitent and Habret) gain resistance to necrotic damage and vulnerability to radiant damage.  
- Magical flight is suppressed, although Benitent can still fly without interference. A creature who tries to fly using magic must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. A failed check denies magical flight to that character until the start of its next turn.  
- Evil-aligned creatures cannot be brought back from death.  

These effects end if either Benitent or Habret are slain.

### Lair Environs

As the characters move closer and closer to the prison that Benitent created for Aeilidrania, they noticed the landscape turns from natural to unnatural in a noticeable way:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The trek into the wilderness, far from any civilized area, brought you into contact with only small animals for the first part of your journey. The last mile, however, was rife with undead creatures that easily fell before you. Something must have drawn these vile creatures to this area.
^430

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that the change in the landscape has nothing to do with any large-scale magical effect in the area. It's simply a result of so many undead creatures coming to the area.

While not part of the lair specifically, you can run as many encounters as you want against undead foes as the characters travel toward the lair. Forcing the characters to use resources now means they have fewer resources later.

### 1. Moat

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A moat comprised of blue-grey water surrounds a plot of land that contains several large willow trees, a pigsty, and a small wooden dwelling. A hazy miasma rises from the moat, making it hard to discern further details about the contents of the island. A wooden bridge crosses the moat on the south side of the island.
^432

When the characters approach, they notice a few lesser undead creatures hurling themselves into the miasma that rises from the moat's water. They instantly die when they touch it.

#### Magic Moat

The moat contains magic-infused water that acts to keep creatures from crossing it. The miasma acts as a curved [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) which, if touched, does 66 (`12d10`) radiant damage (no save). The miasma seals at the top, 60 feet above the island, making the bridge the only means to enter safely. As mentioned earlier, teleportation, planar magic, or digging beneath the island fail to allow egress.

### 2. Bridge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A wooden bridge crosses the moat. The highly polished wood of the bridge shines with a silver light, and small runes are etched into the planks.
^436

A successful DC 25 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals that the runes on the bridge empower it to deliver a [disintegrate](Mechanics/spells/disintegrate.md) spell (Charisma saving throw instead of Dexterity) to anyone who gets halfway across the bridge. Good-aligned creatures are immune to the effect. Evil-aligned, undead, or fiendish creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures don't have to be touching the bridge for this effect to occur. Creatures surviving the effect can access the island.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices that dust has filled the cracks and knots of the wooden boards. Normal bird feathers rest among the dust. This is a clue that flying creatures are not immune to the disintegrating magic of the bridge.

### 3. Sty

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several pigs wallow and root around in a fenced-in pigsty. Arcane runes decorate the fence.
^438

![Empyrean Brazen Bull](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/135-19-001.empyrean-brazen-bull.webp#center)

Five of the pigs are [Empyrean Brazen Bulls](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean-brazen-bull-ghloe.md)* that the angel of Empyreus transformed to hide their presence.

If the characters attack Benitent or attempt to gain access to Aeilidrania, the brazen bulls take on their true form, break out of the pigsty, and attack immediately. A DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals that five of the pigs are not natural creatures.

#### Runed Fence

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals that the runes on the fence power an ongoing magical effect. The runes siphon small amounts of the pig's life force and redirect it to fuel the power of the moat. Destroying the fence eliminates the moat-powered effects on the island within 24 hours.

### 4. Tree

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large and voluminous willow tree stands out among its peers on the island. Silver runes adorn the trunk. A lead box sealed with silver chains rests at the base of the tree.
^43c

This tree has been blessed with the power of Empyreus, allowing it to hold the essence of Benitent. The [Angel of Empyreus](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/angel-of-empyreus-ghloe.md)* can enter or exit the tree as a bonus action. Inside the lead box rests Popilo, a [malikirian imp](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/malikirian-imp-ghloe.md)*.

#### Lead Box

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals the purpose of the box: it's meant to hold a fiendish creature. The lock that holds the chains can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check, or the chain can be easily severed with a weapon attack.

#### Imp

Popilo, the Malikirian imp, serves Benitent. Its sole purpose is to tempt the characters to make a deal with it. Popilo offers to give the characters anything they request, particularly information, for a single piece of silver. Once the characters make any deal with Popilo, Benitent has the excuse needed to attack the characters for being evil and corrupt.

### 5. Dwelling

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A simple wooden dwelling rests at the north side of the island. The building looks well built and sturdy, but plain. The windows are open, and the door stands ajar.
^441

The dwelling houses Habret (a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), although Aeilidrania (an [ancient elven vampire](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/elf-vampire-ancient-ghloe.md)*) spends her waking hours in the secret basement. The runes on the house can be examined successfully with a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. The runes gather life energy from around the island, bringing it to form a prison that keeps a specific undead creature within the dwelling.

#### Habret

Habret could be found anywhere on the island, as the old man spends every waking hour doing chores. Habret can sense the presence of the characters if they approach him, but he cannot hear or see them. He speaks to them, inviting them to share the meat, fruit, and vegetables that he's butchered, grown, or harvested.

If the characters use magic to communicate with Habret, he can convey the following information.

- A kind person who could talk in his mind asked Habret to come to this place and take care of it. He's been here for several months, and he takes care of the pigs, does chores, and otherwise just does what he was asked.  
- Not long after coming here, another person who could talk to his mind arrived. Habret talks to her every day, but he doesn't know where she lives. She just seems to appear and disappear at odd times. This person seems to be very learned and old, as she discusses things she's seen and done that indicate she's lived a long time and traveled the world.  
- Before taking on the task that the original person gave him, that person drew something on Habret's back. Habret isn't sure what it was, but it didn't hurt, and Habret has never felt better than he does now.  

If the characters look at Habret's back, there's a large symbol of Empyreus drawn in silver ink there. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check not only recognizes the symbol, but it also reveals that it is part of a complex network of energy that maintains all the magic of this island.

#### Secret Trapdoor

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) allows the characters to notice that the animal-skin rug on the floor covered a trapdoor. The door leads to a 10-foot-deep cellar, which houses Aeilidrania's prison.

#### Aeilidrania

The elven vampire spends most of her time in the basement, but when Habret is in the house, she comes up to talk with him. She can't leave the house because of the abjuration magic employed by Benitent. She also knows she cannot harm Habret, and she finds the old man curious and enjoys talking with him.

If the characters ask her to provide the information they seek, she lies and tells them she cannot provide it because of the magic of the island prison. If they could kill Habret for her, however, she would be able to leaveâ€”and she would be happy to provide that information. Just speaking with Aeilidrania is enough to bring Benitent to attack the characters.

## Conclusion

It's likely that the characters must defeat Benitent to get the information they need from Aeilidrania; unfortunately, doing that releases all the abjurations that keep the vampire in and its minions out. A conscientious party would attempt to destroy the vampire instead of releasing her on the world.

If you're interested in giving the characters a way to get the information without having to kill everything on the island, here is an option: Since Aeilidrania does not see Habret as a threat, the vampire might have told the old man precisely the information that the characters are looking for. Habret would not have remembered the exact details, but by using magic, the characters might be able to retrieve that information.
