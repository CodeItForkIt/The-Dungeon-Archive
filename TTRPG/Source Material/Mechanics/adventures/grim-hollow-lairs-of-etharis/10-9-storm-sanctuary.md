# 9: Storm Sanctuary
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 37* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Storm Sanctuary is an ithjar lair for four or five 9th-level characters.

## Background

Long ago, worshippers built a temple and shrine to the gods, who they imagined in the form of dragons. The temple and shrines are long abandoned, but a small cult of panjaian ilharans found the ruins and turned them to their own purposes: luring and protecting stormborn ithjars. The ilharans have built a small worship space and created an enchanted playground for their darling ithjars to frolic in. They are about to achieve their grandest goal: the stormborn ithjar who roosts here has lain eggs. The ilharans have taken great pains to make sure that the roost is safe—even from curious members of their own sect—and are awaiting the hatchlings. Wild animals have taken over the nearby ruins, but through long months of confrontation, the ilharans stay out of the ruins and the beasts don't venture into the ilharans' sanctuary.

### Set the Hook

The ilharans' plans are at odds with civilized society: hungry ithjar (both regular and stormborn) have been raiding roads and farms for decades, but lately they've grown bolder, wiping out villages and even attacking fortified settlements and castles. The characters have been hired by the governor or regent of the region to find the ithjar lair and wipe out the threat. Diviners have tracked the ithjar to the Storm Sanctuary, and now the characters must take them on. Alternatively, the characters may need an ithjar egg for a ritual, craft, or contract. Their efforts to locate an egg ultimately lead them to the Storm Sanctuary.

## Lair Overview

The Storm Sanctuary is high in the forested mountains and surrounded by natural formations and artificial constructions; many partitions close off parts of the Storm Sanctuary from other areas. Any flight—whether magical or natural—draws the immediate attention of two ithjars, and combat in the sky risks bringing all the ithjars in area 6 and the stormborn ithjar from area 8. Panjaian ilharans* and beasts present in areas where aerial combat is occurring get involved as well. Similarly, climbing the cliffs and crags on the eastern half of the map can be done with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. When a character reaches the zenith of a crag or cliff, the ithjars are alerted as if the character were flying.

The descriptions of each area assumes a daylight approach. At night, halve the number of panjaian ilharans and double the number of beasts in each area; the number of ithjar stays the same.

### 1. Open Pagoda

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A simple wooden pagoda, elegantly constructed, dominates the landscape here. Two rows of wooden benches, little more than felled trees, face the pagoda. Tall vertical wooden walls capped with sharpened tops flank the area to the north and east.
^202

Six [panjaian ilharans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/panjaian-ilharan-ghloe.md)* await the stormborn ithjar's hatchlings here. One stands in the pagoda, giving what amounts to a sermon to her peers about the glories of the storm and the power of the plane of air. Her name is Arial (CN, desires all sentient life to acknowledge the superiority of Ilhara over the other Primordials). The other five are sitting and listening or inattentively daydreaming. Characters have advantage on checks to [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) these creatures.

#### Negotiating with the Ilharans

The panjaian stationed here are guardians of the ithjar. Respectful and knowledgeable characters may be able to convince the panjaian they're pilgrims come to adore the ithjar. The panjaians start as hostile but not so hostile they'll attack on sight. Arial is gullible and willing to believe that her own reputation has brought potential pilgrims; however, she has a hatred of elves. This can be overlooked unless an elf is the characters' spokesperson!

Through interaction and diplomacy, the characters may shift Arial and her peers' attitude to indifferent. Doing so avoids combat with the panjaians (for now) and even means they'll share an important secret: no one can see the ithjars now because the key to the gate that leads to their nests was lost in the ruins to the north (and flying or climbing enrages the ithjar).

Characters who manage to do particularly well in negotiations may even be able to shift Arial (if not her peers') to a friendly attitude. If friendly, Arial confirms that a stormborn ithjar has lain eggs. If the negotiations break down or the characters decide to attack first, the panjaians fight to the death.

### 2. Air Elemental Statue

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the convergence of the two wooden walls, the ground is replaced by plate-sized natural stones polished and placed to appear as pavers in a plaza. At the center of this plaza is a moving statue, an aery elemental that is anchored to the ground but which wafts and flutters in the wind. To the north, ruined walls are all that remain of a once impressive structure. To the east, cliffs rise fifty feet or more above your head. The cliffs disappear beyond your view to the north and south.
^206

The statue is a complicated illusion created by the panjaians. Over time, some of them have come to believe it is a real air elemental that has been trapped, but it's still just an illusion. The stone it is anchored to radiates faint illusion magic when subjected to [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md).

#### Beneath the Statue

Casting [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the statue suppresses it for one hour. When the statue is suppressed, it becomes clear the stone it's anchored to is really the lid to a chest! A search of the base with a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check also reveals this to be true. In either case, once the truth about the "stone" is realized, it's a simple matter to pry it open. Inside are two moonstones (worth 50 gp each) and four [potions of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md).

### 3. Ruined Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Up some crumbling stairs is a jagged hall. Its roof has long since rotted away and only a few stone columns remain to provide a sense that the walls were once two or even three times higher than their ruined remains would suggest. A deep growl is quickly joined by several others from the west!
^20a

![Sloth Galloper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/066-09-001.sloth-galloper.webp#center)

The dragon-god worshippers who built the original temple were replaced by druids. These potent spellcasters put curses on the dragon-god temple to make it an attractive dwelling place for beasts. Eight [corpsejaws](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/corpsejaw-ghloe.md)*, eight [shieldheads](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/shieldhead-ghloe.md)*, and four [sloth gallopers](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/sloth-galloper-ghloe.md)* arrive over three rounds. In the first round, half of the animals arrive: corpsejaws arrive from the east and south, shieldheads smash through the ruined walls to the north and west, and the sloth gallopers climb over the northwest and northeast corners. In the second round, a quarter of the animals arrive in the same manner. In the third round, the last quarter of the animals arrive.

#### Beast Behavior

Whenever a humanoid creature enters, if it is not a druid, the beasts are aggressively drawn from the nearby woods to attack it after one round has passed. Any characters with at least one level in druid are completely ignored by the attacking animals unless they attack the animals or aid the animals' enemies. A group entirely composed of druids still draws the animals in, but they merely circle the characters, sniffing curiously before leaving the way they came.

These animals are bloodthirsty and enraged. [Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) checks made to deal with them have disadvantage, but [calm emotions](Mechanics/spells/calm-emotions.md) or similar magic breaks the spell; "calmed" creatures wander off confused if they are not attacked. The beasts fight to the death and pursue fleeing characters.

The magical lure only functions once every 24 hours. Once the characters have dealt with the beasts, they are safe until the next day.

### 4. Ruined Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The purpose of this room is unclear: mold and choked trees grow amid the debris of the ruin, but no furniture remains. In the southeast corner, concealed under a fallen chunk of stone, a half-eaten corpse is rotting.
^20e

The corpse belongs to an adventurous panjaian who mistakenly thought that the gate key would protect him from the beast lure. If the characters climbed into this space before exploring area 3, the same animal attack that would have happened in area 3 happens here instead.

#### Panjaian Corpse

Characters who drag the corpse from under the rock or who lift the rock off of him discover an ornate dragon-headed key needed to open the gate in area 5, a [potion of hill giant strength](Mechanics/items/potion-of-hill-giant-strength.md), and a coin purse with a handful of gemstones, each worth 50 gp: a citrine, a carnelian, three onyx, and two quartz.

### 5. Magic Gate

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This disproportionally tall gate spans the ten-foot gap between two rocky outcroppings. It appears to be composed entirely of a smooth white stone, is spotless, and seamless except for a small keyhole in its center.
^212

The gate itself is not strong, but it is *loud*. The stone is akin to porcelain in its smoothness and sheen but is less brittle.

#### Gaining Entry

The easiest way in is with the key (see area 4). Smashing the gate open requires dealing 20 damage to it (AC 17, damage threshold 5, 40 hp), but each time damage is done to it, it reverberates, creating a shockwave that deals 7 (`2d6`) thunder damage to creatures within a 20-foot radius of the door. This alerts the ithjar (and the panjaians) that someone is breaking through the gate. The gate is nearly impossible to scale, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The cliffs surrounding it can be climbed more easily. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

### 6. The Sacred Pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A small pool of water collects at the base of a ten-foot waterfall before trickling away into the rocks behind. A series of small cairns have been constructed on the path beside the water. The path ascends to the north and descends to the south.
^216

The cairns were built by the panjaian pilgrims before the gate key was lost. Three [ithjars](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ithjar-ghloe.md)* sunbathe on the rocks above the waterfall, keeping an eye on the pool below. They are used to panjaian pilgrims, and if the characters create their own cairns, they're ignored and can investigate the water or continue up the path. If, however, the characters touch the water or continue along the path north without first making cairns, the ithjars attack.

#### Wishing Pool

Hopeful pilgrims have quietly offered riches to the pool. The water is frigid but clear, allowing characters to see down to the bottom of the 15-foot-deep pool. Characters who search its depths with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check over several dives may recover 74 sp, a zircon (50 gp), and 23 gp.

### 7. Nesting Cave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This narrow cave halfway up the cliffside shelters a grass nest from wind, sun, and weather.
^21a

The cave is 15 feet up the cliffside from area 8. The stormborn ithjar's three eggs rest in this nest. If tended by the mother, they hatch in `1d6 + 3` days. If taken from the nest, they cannot hatch without supernatural or magical intervention. The [stormborn ithjar](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/stormborn-ithjar-ghloe.md)* itself is here guarding its brood, unless it was dealt with elsewhere. The stormborn ithjar defends the nest to the death and (if they haven't already been dealt with), its cries summon the ithjars from area 6.

#### Timing

The stormborn ithjar rests during the day but hunts briefly during the nighttime hours. Characters who wait for nightfall have a chance to steal the eggs without fighting the stormborn ithjar (if that's their objective). Observing the nest unseen requires waiting in area 8 and succeeding at a group DC 16 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check as they stay hidden for hours.

#### The Nest

In addition to the eggs, a suit of [mithral half-plate armor](Mechanics/items/mithral-armor.md) has been broken up and its constituent pieces used to hold precious stones, each worth 50 gp: three sardonyx, two star rose quartz, and one cracked garnet.

### 8. Dragon Sanctuary

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This mountain haven is preternaturally peaceful. Butterflies flutter silently in the cool breeze, and the two ancient carvings of dragon heads set among the larger monoliths seem inviting rather than foreboding.
^21f

Characters who wish to sneak up on the stormborn ithjar in area 7 must be hidden or to have disguised themselves in panjaian pilgrim clothing while entering this area. If not, it waits for an opportunity to strike.

#### Dragon Heads

Once, this was a holy sanctuary for followers of the dragon gods. Its sacred energy is still present: divine spells that strengthen, bolster, or guard allies (such as [bless](Mechanics/spells/bless.md) and [spirit guardians](Mechanics/spells/spirit-guardians.md)) are cast as if one spell level higher while in this sanctuary. [Cure wounds](Mechanics/spells/cure-wounds.md) and other healing spells are unaffected. Spellcasters who can cast an affected spell immediately realize this property and intuitively understand how it works.

## Conclusion

Characters who capture the stormborn ithjar or recover the stormborn ithjar's eggs and fulfill the requirements of their quest can receive their reward. If they were hired to recover the creature or its eggs, they may find themselves facing an ithjar-riding army in the future! If the egg was a reagent in a ritual or spell, what else do they need to complete it? Does the ritual or spell do what they set out to do? Perhaps the Primordial Ilhara or her followers are upset about their desecrated sanctuary—they may hunt down the characters in the future.
