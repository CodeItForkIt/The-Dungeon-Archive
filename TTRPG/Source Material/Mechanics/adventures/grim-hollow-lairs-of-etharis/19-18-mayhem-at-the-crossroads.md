# 18: Mayhem at the Crossroads
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 73* 

*By Shawn Merwin*

Mayhem at the Crossroads is a caprathorn lair for four or five 18th-level characters.

## Background

Floss's Cross was a prosperous hamlet set at the crossroads of two important trade routes. The people of Floss's Cross worked hard to provide the best food, drink, and services to the many travelers who passed through their village, and they grew accustomed to the prosperity that came with a respected reputation. The place earned a high standing among even the most powerful people in Etharis, making it a place where political, religious, social, and economic leaders would meet in secret to discuss, negotiate, barter, entreat, and strategize.

Unfortunately, the hamlet's success and reputation also drew some unwanted attention. An avarice seraph called Rusk and a gluttony seraph called Yort realized that by infiltrating the town, they might be able to corrupt some of the very powerful people who visited Floss's Cross regularly. The pair, along with their lesser disavowed minions, have turned the place into a ticking time bomb.

They found a way to attract a caprathorn to the area. The potential devastation a caprathorn might cause gives the pair of disavowed leverage over the rich and powerful visitors to the town, and it would certainly bring powerful people to deal with it. Ruck and Yort also hold a powerful hostage in town, and they plan to either kill or corrupt the heroes who come to investigate.

### Set the Hook

A powerful figure in Etharis (or your own world) came to Floss's Cross. Neither they, their bodyguards, nor other members of their retinue have been heard from since they first arrived. The disappearance of such a powerful figure has many people worried. Worse yet, rumors that a dreadful minion of the Great Beast has been hunting in the area stoke those worries. The characters are asked to find out what happened to this powerful figure.

## Lair Overview

The provided map shows only the center of the hamlet of Floss's Cross. Other shops, businesses, taverns, and inns rest outside of the hamlet's center. However, all the danger and duplicity the characters find in Floss's Cross radiate out from this central area. Any building on the map that's not numbered is an empty residence—either fled by its normal occupants, or a building for rent that currently has no tenants. (Adding more interesting elements or enemies to those areas is recommended if you want to lengthen or increase the difficulty of the lair.)

The center of town has been attacked by the caprathorn once already, leaving some damage to the area. The population of the hamlet has locked themselves in their homes and businesses, waiting for the caprathorn to attack again. The people of the town are unaware that anything untoward is happening in and around the town square—at least in regards to the disavowed taking over and taking a hostage. They've been told to remain in their homes because of the threat of the caprathorn, but they think the problem is being handled.

The caprathorn and its minions presently haunt the forested area outside the hamlet. The caprathorn does not approach town until the magic of the Floss Memorial statue (see Area 1) is activated by Rusk or Yort. The two disavowed do that as soon as it becomes clear that the characters are too powerful for them and their lesser seraph allies to handle.

### 1. Floss Memorial Statue

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the center of town, where the two well-traveled trade routes meet, stands a marble statue depicting a smiling woman, her arms spread wide as if casting a blessing over the entire area. A gold plaque on the base of the statue reads, "In Honor of Frannie Floss, Matron of Our Town, Honored by All Who Revere Home and Hearth." Unlit candles and small trinkets are placed on the statue and around its base.
^404

#### Statue

The statue has been magically empowered by the disavowed seraphs Rusk and Yort to act as a beacon for the caprathorn. A successful DC 25 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the summoning power of the magic infusing the statue. The magic of the statue cannot be dispelled with anything except a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell or powerful divine intervention.

A success DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) reveals that none of the candles or trinkets have been lit or placed here in the last several days. Obviously, those who generally leave offerings in memory of Frannie Floss have failed to do so for a while.

> Rusk is attempting to charm Evi and gain a larger foothold in the hamlet.

### 2. Rusk's Residence

The doors and windows to this building have been shuttered and locked. The locks are not strong, easily defeated with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. Once inside, the characters can examine the interior.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small dwelling is nicely appointed with fine furnishings. Two women sit sipping wine and chatting in front of a fire.
^408

Unless she is encountered elsewhere, Rusk ([avarice seraph](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/avarice-seraph-ghloe.md)*) is here talking with Evi ([noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)), the proprietor of the Sideways Wayside, an establishment elsewhere in Floss's Cross. Rusk is attempting to charm Evi and gain a larger foothold in the hamlet.

Rusk realizes that the adventurers are quite powerful, so she does her best to put them at ease and answer their questions. She attempts to lie to them while still telling the truth. Her plan is to lead them to a place where she can get the assistance of the other seraphs in town, or even call the caprathorn to take out the characters.

### 3. Private Tavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small tavern bustles with activity. An ogresh cook orders around several other workers and servers, preparing several plates of food. A party of six well-dressed diners sits at a table, sampling the delicious-smelling fare.
^40a

This private tavern caters to wealthy patrons looking for a unique meal cooked by a master chef residing in Floss's Cross. The chef, an ogresh named Hemina ([noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)), has been under suggestion spells from Yort, the [gluttony seraph](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/gluttony-seraph-ghloe.md)*, for the past several days. Under this magical compulsion, Hemina prepares and distributes food made with various herbs supplied by Yort, which have had magical effects on the people eating them.

![Gluttony Seraph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/128-18-004.gluttony-seraph.webp#center)

Hemina accepted the help supplied by Yort, in the form of seven [lesser gluttony seraphs](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/lesser-gluttony-seraph-ghloe.md)*, who are using magic to take the form of normal humanoids. A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check pierces their magical disguises and reveals something unusual about them.

#### Hemina

Between the magic and the innate charms of the disavowed, Hemina is muddled in her thinking. She strongly believes both Rusk and Yort are wonderful friends. Hemina remembers serving food to the powerful figure and their bodyguards, but she hasn't seen them in a few days. She assumes they, like many of the people in town, are staying hidden because of the threat of the caprathorn.

#### Diners

The dining party consists of six wealthy travelers ([nobles](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) who couldn't turn down the chance to eat a meal at one of the premiere restaurants among the elite of Etharis. Unfortunately for them, the seraphs added poison to the meal, with the plan of killing them, stealing their coin and jewelry, and burning the bodies.

Not long after the characters enter the building, the diners start suffering the effects of the poison. If the characters attempt to help the diners, each needs a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check to save them from dying. Magic that neutralizes poison also works. If the characters attempt to intercede, the seraphs attack them.

#### Pantry

If the characters search the pantry, they find many ingredients of a magical, rather than a culinary, nature. On a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check, someone knows these ingredients, if ingested in the correct amounts and combinations, could cause anything from lethargy to intense pain to incapacitation to death. These ingredients are rare, and an alchemist specializing in rare ingredients and components would pay 750 gp for them.

#### Rewards

If the characters can save all six of the diners, the wealthy patrons give each character a reward of 500 gp, and they promise to owe the characters a favor (which you can determine what it means).

### 4. Yort's Residence

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rotund man in a silk robe startles at your intrusion. "What's this all about," he blusters, as he falls out of his chair while reaching ineffectually for a dagger.
^411

Yort, a [gluttony seraph](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/gluttony-seraph-ghloe.md)*, uses magic to disguise himself as human, pretending to be a doddering fool. A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check alerts a character that this person is acting like a fool but is very much in control of the situation and feigning surprise.

#### Ruse

Yort pretends to be a resident of the town, hiding out in his home. He knows better than to challenge the characters on his own, so he tries to get them to accompany him to an area where allies might help him. He also uses the statue to summon the caprathorn if the situation is dire.

### 5. Hostage

The doors and windows of this stable are boarded up, despite some structural damage. There are no locks to pick, but as this stable is not solidly built, a successful DC 20 Strength check can break open any door or window. If the characters gain access, they can see the situation.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four large angelic figures, their red eyes glowing and beautiful faces wearing a sneer, stand over a bound figure within this very clean stable.
^415

Eight [lesser avarice seraphs](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/lesser-avarice-seraph-ghloe.md)* occupy the stables. Only four are in the stables at a time, as they take turns watching over the powerful figure, whom they have kidnapped and plan to hold for ransom. The other four, however, are in the area and rush to help their associates if a battle breaks out. Their instructions are to make sure that their prisoner does not escape, and that no one snoops around and sees them. If a battle does begin, one of them rushes to retrieve Rusk.

#### Powerful Figure

This powerful figure can be an NPC from Etharis (if you are running a Grim Hollow campaign) or from your own world. They should have enough influence and power to make their survival something important to your campaign.

If the battle is going badly for the seraphs—which it most assuredly will at this level of play—one of the seraphs threatens the NPC if they characters do not back away. At this level, hostage situations are generally not an issue for characters, as they have magical capabilities that can bring people back to life with very little problem. If you want the hostage situation to present a true challenge, have the NPC hostage admit to the players that because of a family curse, no magic can bring them back to life once they're dead.

### The Caprathorn

At whatever point you are ready to have the caprathorn make its appearance, it charges into the center of town.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A huge goat-headed figure charges up the path toward the center of town. The four horns that adorn its head are covered with runes. Vines grow from the beast, and hanging from the ends of the vines are twisted-looking sheep. The lot are covered with blood.
^419

In addition to the [caprathorn](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/caprathorn-ghloe.md)*, nine [thornlamms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/thornlamm-ghloe.md)* accompany their master. Driven to a frenzy by the call of the magic exuded by the statue, the caprathorn looks to kill anything within its line of sight.

#### Chaotic Battle

While the disavowed can summon the caprathorn, they cannot control it. This means that any battle involving all three sides (characters, disavowed, and caprathorn) can go in any direction. Many high-level groups could handle the battle even if the disavowed and caprathorn worked together, but regulating the action based on the success of the characters is highly recommended.

## Conclusion

If the characters rescue the powerful figure being held in the stables before he is killed by his captors, that person rewards them with at least 1,000 gp worth of gems, coins, and other precious gifts—if the characters assist that person in getting home, of course.

If the characters rescue them but allow harm to come to them first, the reward is halved and the powerful figure acts much more stiffly around the characters, expecting that heroes of such power should have been able to mount a rescue more expertly than they did.

Regardless, the people of Floss's Cross are ecstatic that the characters not only eliminated the caprathorn, but also rooted out the corruption brought to the town by the disavowed. Being heroes of an area beloved by so many powerful people certainly could have its perks.
