# 3: The Leatherhollow
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 13* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

The Leatherhollow is a skinweaver lair for four or five 3rd-level characters.

## Background

Once upon a time, a cave belonging to morbus kobolds was attacked by a skinweaver. The creature slew their leader, installing itself as "chief" over the kobolds. It expects them to deliver fresh supplies of food and (just as importantly) hides for it to tan and work. When they fail to deliver sufficient hides, the skinweaver uses the kobolds for that purpose.

This cave system has three major areas: the deepest belongs to the skinweaver itself. The midrange depths belong to a spythronar swarm. The caves closest to the outside belong to the skinweaver's kobold minions.

### Set the Hook

The characters are hired to investigate the mysterious disappearances from farms on the outskirts of the village. First it was just livestock, but now people are vanishing too. In the latest abduction, a child saw his parents carried off by "little scaly men" (kobolds). To increase the suspense, have one of the missing abductees be a family member or friend of the characters.

Alternately, the characters could be investigating why kobolds, who used to fear coming too close to human settlements, have suddenly become more brazen, stealing livestock and abducting people.

## Lair Overview

No natural sources light the caves, so only the initial cave opening has daylight. The tunnels between the three cave sections are cramped enough that only Small creatures (like kobolds) can walk them upright, but larger creatures need to squeeze. The caves are damp and cool with smooth walls and floors. In the spythronar and skinweaver sections, spiderwebbing is prevalent on walls and ceilings and make the floors tacky.

At least once a day, a pair of kobolds (whoever draws the short straws) must bring their latest catch, whether livestock or humanoid, to the skinweaver. Doing so is dangerous both for the capricious nature of the skinweaver and because of the spythronar in the caves betweenâ€”both the skinweaver and the spythronar sometimes take a kobold as a meal. The kobolds have not dared to bring a separate offering to feed the spythronar, being more afraid of the skinweaver's knives.

### 1. First Cave (Entrance)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the partially barricaded mouth, this cave opens to vaulted ceilings. A large cooking fire burns brightly in the center of the space. Two openings lead deeper into the cave system to the north and east.
^074

![Morbus Kobold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/016-03-001.morbus-kobold-r.webp#center)

Six [morbus kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* are ringing the fire, telling stories instead of paying attention to the cave entrance. Their passive Perception is 6. A fight here draws the attention of the kobolds sleeping in area 3, who arrive as soon as they can. They travel through area 2 to reach area 1 to avoid the pit trap.

#### Pit Trap

The northern exit to this chamber is trapped. A concealed 10-foot-square spiked pit trap, is on area 1's side of the opening. Passive Perceptions of 15 or higher detect it just before stepping on it; a successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check while looking for traps find it as well. When one character steps onto the trap, that character must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take `2d10` piercing damage from the spikes in the 10-foot-deep pit.

### 2. Lavatory Pit & Cages

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber reeks of rotting waste. A large depression in the center buzzes and writhes with the sounds and movements of thousands of insects feasting on the assembled dung and trash. Four crude wooden cages are arrayed on the far side. Three tunnels and an opening lead beyond.
^078

The lavatory pit is smelly and gross but not dangerous. The cages contain at least two sheep and a single humanoid prisoner. If the characters have been sent to find and rescue anyone, all but one of the NPCs they've been sent to rescue are in the cages. The last prisoner is in area 7. Any prisoners here are suffering from two levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) from malnutrition and have 1 hp.

#### Cages

The cells are rudimentary and can be broken open with a successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or the locks picked with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check. There are two keys. The skinweaver carries one and the other is on one of the kobold corpses in the spythronar webs in area 5.

### 3. Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stench of malodorous sweat fills this cave. Clusters of rough sleeping mats are radially arranged around an enormous stalagmite pillar in the center. The pillar has been carved to resemble a strange, malformed creature. A few battered crates serve as footlockers for the creatures who dwell here. Two tunnels lead east, larger tunnel grades downward to the north, and a larger opening leads south.
^07c

Eight [morbus kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* are sleeping in this chamber if they weren't already drawn to fighting in area 1. A fight here brings the three [morbus kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* who have snuck off to the root cellar in area 4 to gamble.

#### Stalagmite

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check reveals that this stalagmite has been carved into a crude representation of the Filth Grazer, which the morbus kobolds worship. They've been forced to denounce their allegiance to that entity while serving the skinweaver.

### 4. Root Cellar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A short down-grade levels out in this musty, earthen space. Poorly piled stacks of potatoes, beets, and onions are heaped around. Most of these dirt-covered foods have sprouted green roots and tendrils. Only one tunnel leads up and out of this space.
^080

The three [morbus kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* here, if they haven't been drawn to fighting elsewhere in the complex, are gambling with dice over a beautiful pair of elven boots.

#### Magical Boots

The elven boots are quickheels, magical boots (requiring attunement) that allow the wearer to use a bonus action to double their speed for a single round. This effect requires a long rest before the item can be used again. They have an Elven inscription written across the tongues that, when taken together reads, "You only need to cross the finish line once to win the race."

### 5. Spider Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The expansive cave is obscured by omnipresent webbing: walls, ceiling, and floor are all coated in the tendrils of pale web. Large cocoons, some intact and some ripped open, hint at the hungry nature of the cavern's inhabitants.
^084

The webs are tacky, making the floor (and walls and ceiling) here "difficult terrain". One [spythronar swarm](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/spythronar-swarm-ghloe.md)* is concealed in normal webs on the ceiling at the northwest end of the chamber. A successful DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check is required to see them before they [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) any creature passing through their territory. At the southeast end of the chamber is a [spythronar web](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/spythronar-web-ghloe.md)*.

#### Cocoons

Among the dozens of entombed animals are several kobolds who had the misfortune to cross the chamber while the spythronar were hunting. One of these cocooned (and deceased) kobolds has the key to the cages in area 2 as well as a small pouch containing a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md). The characters automatically find this kobold and his loot after thoroughly searching the area for ten minutes. Characters who succeed on an DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check can speed up this process and do it in five minutes.

### 6. Skinweaver's Blinds

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Emerging from the tunnel, you find yourself in a forest of leather strips and webbing. Spider webs crisscross with patches and strands of leather, making it difficult to see more than a few feet. The strands are attached to the ceiling and form an opaque mass before you, like an overabundance of fabric fringe.
^088

![Skinweaver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/017-03-002.skinweaver.webp#center)

The skinweaver set up this blind as an early warning system for itself. The leather and webbing move only when disturbed (there is no breeze this far into the caves), disturbing the skinweaver's webs, alerting it to a visitor or intruder. If the characters move directly forward through it or follow the wall to their right, they end up in the skinweaver's chamber. If they follow the wall to the left instead, they find one of the narrow tunnels leading to the tanning chamber in area 8.

#### Leather and Web Blind

Characters particularly worried about being ambushed in the blind may want to try hacking their way through it or burning it. Hacking is reasonably effective (though slow). Each strand of webbing acts as webbing: AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. The leather is similar: AC 12; hp 7; vulnerability to acid damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage. Destroying a web and a leather section exposes and clears a 5-foot-square section of the blind. If the characters take more than three rounds to clear the blind or move through it, the skinweaver attacks them through the blind. Because of its web-connections, treat the skinweaver as having [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) against any characters in contact with the blind.

### 7. Skinweaver Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Aside from the grotesque splotches of spider web, this cave looks like the most opulent of bedrooms. Leather tapestries hang on the walls and from the high ceiling; a large crude statue of malformed monstrosity peers out from the north wall; a circular mattress rests on a frame of webbing and leather suspended from the ceiling; and bookcases, wardrobes, and mirrors all give the impression of culture and refinement. Atop a three-tiered dais rests a large throne made of different-colored leather strips.
^08c

This is the skinweaver's inner sanctum. If not for how all the clothing and furniture is sized for a Large creature with several more limbs than the average humanoid, it could pass for a royal bedroom suite. All the shine is from bronze and brass, however, not gold or silver. Unless it has been fetched by the kobolds to deal with threats elsewhere, the characters probably run into the [skinweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/skinweaver-ghloe.md)* and three [morbus kobold](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* attendants here. The kobolds recently brought a victim for the skinweaver to flay and eat, and they receive new orders as the characters arrive.

The skinweaver fights to the death not because it's desperate or ideologically driven, but because it's so full of itself that it cannot conceive of its own defeat.

#### Filth Grazer Statue

This crude statue is worthless but belonged to the kobold's original chieftain. She stashed a [potion of growth](Mechanics/items/potion-of-growth.md) down its throat. The vial can be discovered with a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

#### Key

The skinweaver carries one of the keys to the cages in area 2.

#### Tapestries, Wardrobes, Bookshelves, and Desk

The majority of the tapestries are sewn to anchor points in the walls and are immovable without destroying them. The clothes in the wardrobe are tailored to the skinweaver and are similarly worthless except for their leather value. The books are on a variety of topics including languages, geography, and, of course, tailoring. Characters who spend at least an hour perusing the books gain advantage on their next Intelligence ability check. The small collection can be sold for 35 gp. The desk is filled with strange notations; even [comprehend languages](Mechanics/spells/comprehend-languages.md) does not reveal the meaning of the scribbles. A character proficient with [leatherworker's](Mechanics/items/leatherworkers-tools.md) or [weaver's tools](Mechanics/items/weavers-tools.md) who spends four hours researching them realizes they're patterns for exquisite leatherworking. The patterns can be sold to a collector (once translated out of the skinweaver's shorthand) for 100 gp.

### 8. Tanning Area

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is stiflingly hot and filled with pungent, eye-watering, lung-burning air. Hissing, popping, and sizzling sounds come from half-a-dozen large metal vats, each containing gallons of liquid. A metal rack, large enough to restrain a human-sized creature, is attached to the east wall. Metal tables covered in a wide range of tools and hides in various stages of tanning interweave between the vats.
^092

If the characters were sent to rescue someone, they find their quarry here, [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) but stable (0 hp) and strapped to the metal rack. Some of the NPC's skin has been removed with surgical precision in disturbing patches of specific shapes; from a distance, these patches appear as monochromatic red tattoos. If the characters have not been sent to rescue anyoneâ€”or if they took days to explore the complexâ€”the NPC on the rack is dead when they arrive.

#### Vats

The vats contain the various chemical agents and acids the skinweaver employs to create its insane masterpieces. A creature who touches a substance takes `1d4` acid damage; a creature submerged in a vat takes `2d6` acid damage per round it is submerged and an additional `2d6` acid damage on the round after it's no longer submerged.

#### Rack

The metal rack is effective at restraining a creature but can easily be opened by any creature not [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) on it.

## Conclusion

Defeating the skinweaver, rescuing the prisoners, and determining the fate of the person in the tanning room ends this adventure and disperses any remaining kobolds. The characters return to the local farms as heroes. Future adventures might seek to answer the question of where the skinweaver came from. Perhaps it only targeted people from a particular extended family or even a particular village: why only them? Who was really pulling the strings?
