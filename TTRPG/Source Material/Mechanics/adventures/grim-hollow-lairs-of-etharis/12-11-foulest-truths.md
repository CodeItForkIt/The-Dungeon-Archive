# 11: Foulest Truths
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 45* 

*By Greg Marks*

Foulest Truths is a harvester of lies lair for four or five 11th-level characters.

## Background

Mauro Cavaliere began life as an entertainer, plying his trade as an actor, singer, and grifter. Eventually he accumulated enough money to branch into usury, and later, legitimate banking. Throughout his career, fast talking and silver lies lined his purse. Unfortunately, a few weeks ago, he met a violent end when former acquaintances murdered him for his fat purse. After pushing his body into the canal, it got caught in an effluent pipe near his home, floating there unnoticed for a day before rising again the next night as a harvester of lies.

Greed still claws at Mauro, but it's a hunger to collect the tongues of liars and sew himself the finest coat of tongues Morencia has ever seen. The recently born harvester of lies haunts low areas of the city: half-flooded basements, sewage pipes that drain to the canals, and walkways under the docks—dragging liars to their deaths. In a city of merchants' and bankers' guilds, liars are easy to come by.

### Set the Hook

In one week, it will be midsummer—and the Black Carnival comes to the city. Morencians dress in costumes, lie about who they are, and indulge in all sorts of base activities. If allowed free reign during the Black Carnival, Mauro may feast and his pack of undead grow out of control.

![Harvester of Lies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/078-11-001.harvester-of-lies.webp#center)

But a member of the Bankers' Guild, Vissia Giliverti, noticed that many in her neighborhood have gone missing. She fears for her person and fortune. Money is replaceable but her life is not, so she hired a group of troubleshooters to get to the bottom of what the city's watch could not. Many of the missing are con artists, grifters, and even a few politicians. All the disappearances have occurred in the same neighborhood, so there is bound to be some lair within. The characters have seven nights before the Black Carnival and Doge Giliverti's ball. If her ball suffers, the characters will suffer, but if the murderer is brought to heel before, the reward will be great.

#### Alternate Hook

Magistrate Lucente was as crooked as a dog's leg, taking bribes to issue official writs, change a judicial ruling, or arrange for the jailing of political enemies. An enemy of the characters pays Magistrate Lucente to issue a warrant for the arrest of the characters. Before it can be served, however, his lifeless body is found with its tongue cut out. Using the corrupted warrant as leverage, Magistrate Savina orders the characters to solve Lucente's murder or be imprisoned.

## Lair Overview

Much of the city on the canals rests on pilings that keep the buildings from sinking into the water. However, many older buildings have sunk a story or more, creating a maze of partially submerged basements, docks, and forests of large wooden poles.

Less a lair and more a hunting ground, Mauro Cavaliere prowls the wet, flooded undercity that surrounds his now-empty home. The more his coat of tongues has grown, the more victims have risen from their own deaths to follow him. He has put them to work clearing out some of the basements, knocking down walls, and attaching planks to pylons under the buildings. This allows him to crawl above the water but under the streets. Everything is wet, dark, and foul smelling, but the undead don't mind. It gives them a quiet place to feast without being noticed by the city watch.

### 1. Underdock

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Algae-covered stairs lead below street level to a half-submerged gate beneath a darkened house. A private boathouse is under the mansion, complete with dock and a poleboat.
^27c

Mauro's home has a dock underneath, which he uses to access the canal. With his death, the key has gone missing and his boat remains untended. The rest of his home has been emptied by creditors and heirs.

#### Gate

The stairs lead down to a ledge intended for dropping off passengers. There is no way to open the gate without a boat or getting into the water. The rusted iron gate's lock is beneath the dirty water. Though not locked, a successful DC 12 Strength check is needed to pull it open.

#### Boat and Dock

A poleboat large enough for four passengers and a boatman is tied to a dock. While inspecting the boat, a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check notes from the growth of algae between the boat and the dock that no one has used or cared for the boat in several weeks.

#### Hole in the Wall

Hard to see from the gate, a hole has been knocked into one of the foundation walls. This leads to planks nailed to pilings that support a neighboring building (area 2).

#### Locked Door

A locked ironbound timber door leads up into the house. The door can be opened with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check or forced open with a DC 20 Strength check. Stairs lead up to a three-story, narrow home that once belonged to Mauro Cavaliere. It is empty.

### 2. Path of Planks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The hole in the wall reveals boards nailed to the neighboring building's pilings: a secret path running under the buildings and streets!
^283

The boards are soaked through and bend precariously when any weight is placed on them, dipping to touch the water. The path passes through holes punched through walls, under streets and buildings, avoiding the canals themselves. It passes several areas where a nimble climber could pass up to an alley or waterfront without being seen.

Mauro left a surprise for anyone who might stumble across his secret path. He captured two [shambling mounds](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) and four [swarms of quippers](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md), leaving them trapped in a flooded basement, occasionally throwing in the bodies of his victims. The shambling mounds look like floating masses of kelp and trash, but as soon as a leg dangles, they try to pull the victim underwater. The quippers are likewise attracted to motion, swarming anyone in the water. All the creatures are starving and desperate for a fresh meal.

#### Planks

The slippery, warped boards can easily be crawled across, but any creature that tries to walk on them must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or slip into the water. If more than 250 pounds is placed on any plank at a time, the boards crack, dumping everyone into the water.

### 3. Pumping Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The sound of splashing water and a rhythmic thumping can be heard before anything can be seen. Six waterlogged corpses move with a sick squishing and tinkling of glass as they endlessly work two pumps, fighting the encroachment of the sea into this low basement-like room. Several chests are piled atop an overturned wardrobe, out of the water, near the exit out of this room.
^287

![Scream Thief](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/081-11-002.scream-thief.webp#center)

This room appears to be from an older building that has sunk further into the mud. The hole from neighboring buildings break through the near the ceiling of this room. There are no planks crossing this basement. Six [shatter corpses](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shatter-corpse-ghloe.md)* are manning pumps, forcing water out of the room. They take no action unless the characters enter the room or attack them, in which case they stop pumping, silently advance. They open their mouths as if to scream but no noise comes out. All of the zombies have had their tongues ripped out. A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can tell that it appears their tongues were removed while they were still alive, before being thrown from windows. Some of the zombies are recognizable as some of the missing grifters and con artists.

The ceiling of this room is eight feet high and is only one foot above the water in the neighboring areas.

#### Chests

The three locked (DC 20) chests rest on an overturned wardrobe. The first chest contains Mauro Cavaliere's business records. If studied over a short rest, a character can determine that many of Mauro's business deals were based on lies, and he was stealing from many of his clients. The records also detail a money laundering scheme for the Red Mask gang. The documents also include details of his personal bank accounts. Most are empty now, but one in a local account box should have 2,700 gp in it, and the key is in the book! If the chest is underwater, the characters must carry the entire chest carefully and dry it out for at least a day in order to rescue the documents. The second chest includes 750 gp worth of jewelry and twenty-two copies of the same fake diamond necklace. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check is needed to determine the forgery. Otherwise, the necklaces seem to be worth 50 gp each. The third chest is the smallest and has [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md) in an old scroll tube, a [potion of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), and the mummified hand of a child. Each round this chest is underwater, roll ``. If the roll is 8 or less, the scroll is destroyed.

#### Rising Water

Every round, two feet of water rushes into the room and each pump maintains the balance by each pushing out one foot of water. If the shatter corpses stop pumping, the balance is disrupted, and the room quickly starts to fill. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check can use an action to operate a pump. If the water rises to four feet, the chests go under water. If the water gets to seven feet, the [shambling mounds](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) and four [swarms of quippers](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-quippers.md) from area 2 can get inside, if they are still alive. The room becomes "difficult terrain" if the water is two feet deep or more.

### 4. The Liar's Test

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The planks end at a flooded, round room. From several different walls, pipes drip vile waste into a cesspit that stands between you and a set of stairs that rise to the opposite wall. The iron door has been cast with a bas relief of two women, one smiling and coy and the other stoic and chaste. Both are puckering their lips as to offer a kiss. Markings around the door frame could be writing.
^28c

The last obstacle before locating Mauro's lair is the Liar's Test. Several broken pipes that should empty into the main canal now deposit their contents into a sunken room below the water level, trapping the waste. If someone is willing to brave the filth, they still must bypass a magical door.

#### Cesspool

The pool of filth is 10 feet deep, and can be swum across normally. Any creature doing so must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. Any open flame in this room causes the room to explode, dealing 21 (`6d6`) fire damage. A successful DC 20 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.

#### Liar's Door

An iron door with no obvious hinges, handle, or lock is at the top of stairs that rise out of the waste pool. The iron is cast to depict two women with lips pursed as if to offer a kiss with small holes in the door between their lips. There appears to be a small switch inside the mouths of both women, just in reach of a creature's tongue. One woman is poised in a flirtatious manner offering a smiling kiss while the other's kiss appears more honest or virtuous. The door radiates abjuration and evocation magic if checked for.

Writing around the frame reads: *"She'll make you a crier, But I've never been slyer. You should have cursed me prior, For now, you kiss me sire."* Placing anything other than a tongue inside one of the holes causes the switch to magically disappear and the creature is shocked with 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage. A successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw halves the damage. The solution is to kiss the "honest" woman, using one's tongue to flip the switch which causes the door to disappear for 1 minute. If a creature kisses the "lying" woman, a blade slashes down on the liar's tongue doing 33 (`8d6 + 5`) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have their tongue ripped out. A creature without a tongue cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a tongue, or has legendary actions. A creature losing its tongue can have it reattached with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check and a week of rest. Higher level healing magic can also do the trick, at the GM's discretion.

### 5. Mauro's Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The iron door disappears, revealing the inside of a rickety tall house that has partially sunk into the water. Its windows are boarded, and it appears as if most of the floors and interior walls have collapsed, leaving rubble and a pile of corpses rising out of the water. Pieces of masonry collapse from above, splashing into the water. Scaffolding has been affixed to the unsteady walls, climbing several stories.
^291

The building has partially sunk into the water, and only four stories remain above the water with parts of crumbling floor at the ends every 10 feet. Sunlight (or moonlight) can be seen coming through a hole in the ceiling. Mauro Cavaliere ([harvester of lies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/harvester-of-lies-ghloe.md)*), 2 [psychic fragment swarms](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/psychic-fragment-swarm-ghloe.md)*, and 4 [scream thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/scream-thief-ghloe.md)* lair here. The scream thieves have no tongues,

If the creatures have forewarning of the characters' approach, the scream thieves join the corpse pile to be surprisingly close to invaders when they enter the room. The psychic fragment swarms hover atop scaffolding on opposite walls, with thier maddening voices kept a low murmur until the characters enter. Mauro carries a [flask of alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md), which he lobs into area 4, trying to catch foes there in a secondary explosion. He then casts [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) and uses its [spider climb](Mechanics/spells/spider-climb.md) trait to hang 15 feet above the door.

#### Boarded-Up Windows

Every story has a window on each side of the building. They are heavily boarded to prevent the curious or foolish from entering the condemned building. A window can be broken through with a successful DC 25 Strength check or by doing 25 points of damage to the timbers.

#### Collapsing Masonry

Every round that violent actions occur in the building causes a chunk of masonry to fall from overhead. A randomly determined character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or get hit by the masonry, taking 14 (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage. Any creature hit by the masonry must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked into the water below. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the chunk of wall pins the character underwater. The character is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until the victim succeeds on a DC 15 escape check. A character adjacent to the victim can move the masonry with a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Large explosions such as spells that do thunder damage, or a fire detonating the gas in area 4, cause a rain of masonry targeting all creatures in the room. Those with scaffolding over their heads gain advantage to the saving throw. If this happens three times, the entire building starts to collapse and all creatures still in the building after three rounds suffer 55 (`10d10`) bludgeoning damage and are pinned by the rubble. Such a creature is [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until they succeed on freeing themselves with a successful DC 20 Strength or Dexterity check to escape.

#### Corpse Pile

On the first floor, the only solid ground above water is a pile of loose rubble and corpses. Treat this ground as "difficult terrain".

#### Scaffolding

The scaffolding has plank floors attached to the walls every 10 feet vertically, roughly where each story previously was. There are ladders at alternating ends. Moving at more than half speed on the scaffolding requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check or the creature falls off into the water below.

## Conclusion

The defeat of Mauro Cavaliere fulfills any obligation the characters may have to Doge Vissia Giliverti or Magistrate Lucente, including a reward of 500 gp.

If the characters recovered the records from the pumping room (area 3), they can claim the money in Mauro's secret account, but the party also becomes a potential target of the Red Masks, the gang that killed Mauro when he stole their money in a fake deal to launder their ill-gotten gains. The gang wants their money, and they want to silence anyone who has seen Mauro's books.
