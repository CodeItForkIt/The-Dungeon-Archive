## Introduction

From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrific aberrations lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountain ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. However, the true monsters of this land are found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.

Etharis is the official world for the Grim Hollow setting. The adventures found herein are an introduction to this gritty and dangerous realm. The rules added in the Grim Hollow tomes are designed for weaving dark fantasy tales. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey bargains, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight.

## Monster Hunting

*Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis* offers a wealth of new creature stat blocks, allowing GMs to challenge, frighten, and delight their players. From new characters cutting their teeth on relatively weak threats, to the most advanced monster slayers dealing with world-shattering events, the monsters in this book offer something for everyone.

The monsters are drawn from every corner of horror and dark fantasy: gothic intrigue, existential dread, gruesome fairy tales, slasher horror, undead hoards, body horror, killer dolls, and so much more.

## Horror Triggers Horror

With so many horrible monsters and threats at your fingertips, there's a good chance that something presented here will bring into your players' minds something that they're uncomfortable with. Before you use these monsters, or run any sort of horror-based campaign, we urge you to discuss with your players their preferences, desires, and limits. Gore, child endangerment, loss of free will, nightmares: all of these and more infest these pages.

The previous Grim Hollow books talk about safety tools and methods you can use to ensure that everyone involved in your game is having a good time and avoiding problematic material. We suggest you review those guidelines—or use other safety tool procedures and guidelines—to learn more about running games, especially games steeped in horror and dark fantasy, for any player.

## Capturing the Grim

Etharis provides a great setting for a grim, gritty campaign. One tool provided in *Lairs of Etharis* is salvage rules. These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits.

## A Little Knowledge Goes a Long Way

Like the salvage rules, lore plays an important part in a dark fantasy setting. Characters may be in trouble if they don't take the time to learn more about the monsters they face. Local legends about a beast may be myth or folly, but even within the folk tales, there could be an iota of truth—and that truth could be the difference between surviving an encounter and suffering an ultimate defeat.

The ability checks associated with each monster are meant to provide details on what a character might know about a monster—or what a character might find out. Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences.

## Ultimately, the Goal is Fun

Regardless of how you run your games, or what your players want from a game, it's important to remember that the goal of playing this game is to have fun and tell great stories. The monsters in this book are there to challenge characters, but they're also there to enhance stories. No bit of lore or game mechanical number is more important than the fun and the story. Change whatever you must to ensure everyone at the table enjoys themselves, contributes to the story, and leaves the table satisfied.

With that said, prepare yourself to encounter some of the most terrifying, challenging, entertaining, and bizarre creatures to ever stalk the lands of your imagination!

## You are a Game Master

As Game Master (GM) of a Lair, you have the power of a storyteller, spinning tales of heroism and adventure to a rapt audience. Imagine yourself dressed in the clothes of a traveling bard, your face cast in glowing firelight as you weave a tapestry of words. Your words draw those who sit around the fire with you into another world—but they aren't just the audience of these tales, but actors and storytellers themselves.

The GM's role is to establish the setting of each scene in the Lair, introduce and portray its nonplayer characters (NPCs), and play monsters and villains who long to bring a swift end to the heroes' adventures. The players at your table are storytellers in their own right. Though they embody a single character each while you embody many, the players have the power to make decisions that will change the world forever. The best GMs are willing to improvise, even ignoring the text when necessary, to ensure the characters' actions have consequences—for both good and ill.
