# 5: Gloomrock Caverns
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 21* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Gloomrock Caverns is a dawndrinker lair for four or five 5th-level characters.

## Background

This cave system houses a natural underground ecosystem. If not for the dawndrinker's presence, it's unlikely the characters would have found their way into it: there is no long-forgotten dungeon, no veins of precious metal, no dark and evil civilization below it—unless you want there to be for a future adventure!

The dawndrinker lairs in the deepest part of the cavern, but several monstrous creatures have long resided in the caves, hunting the rats, fish, worms, and sightless creatures that feed on the fungi around the waterways. The only ones who even notice the difference caused by the dawndrinker's presence are the grimlocks. Before their night foraging was restricted, now they have discovered freedom from the sun's heat and easier hunting in its absence—their blindness is no longer a curse but a blessing.

### Set the Hook

This dawndrinker has had months to (fairly literally) soak up the sun. The dawndrinker's aura of advanced darkness is in full effect. For a mile in any given direction, the sun is as pale as a cloud-shrouded moon, and, beneath even the slightest shade, total darkness reigns. Trees and plants have begun to wither, and docile animals have fled the area in droves, driven away by the persistent darkness. The characters have either been hired to determine the source of this darkness and restore the light, or have undertaken this quest on their own.

## Lair Overview

Carefully read over the dawndrinker's abilities, as it establishes the light-source rules for the lair. Notably, [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) does not function in the Gloomrock Caverns! Because the area is in perpetual night, other than the foraging habits of the grimlocks (which are cyclic and focused on the underwater lake in areas 2 and area 3), the creatures' lives are almost static.

### 1. Caverns Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After hundreds of feet of trudging downward in the dark and uniform tunnel, the cavern opens a bit. The height of the ceiling triples and the stale smell of raw fish and manure interrupts your journey.
^0ec

Unless the characters are extremely careful and stealthy the entire length of the corridor, the two [grimlocks](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md), who have climbed up from their island to eat some captured fish, are aware that there are intruders. They attempt to hide and, if spotted, dive down into area 2 to fetch the other grimlocks as reinforcements. Smart characters would normally find this as easy as shooting fish in a barrel, but in the advanced darkness it may not be so easy!

#### Rough Ascent

Hidden 25 feet up on the northeast wall is a large opening to another tunnel (area 4). From ground level, it is difficult to see. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check (and have light sufficient to see it) notice it. The stones on the wall are jagged and easy to climb unless the characters are in combat. In combat, characters must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to advance up the wall.

#### Smooth Descent

Characters without sufficient light sources who are moving too quickly may pitch themselves over the 25-foot drop and into the water below. The wall here is wet, requiring a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to successfully scale without the help of a rope. Characters who climb up from the water in area 2 and reach the top automatically notice the handholds the grimlocks made leading to area 4.

### 2. Grimlock Island

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A small island rises out of the cool, languid water. To the west, the cave moves sharply up. To the east, it narrows and follows the water down into another cavern.
^0f1

In addition to the two in area 1, six more [grimlocks](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/grimlock.md) fish and swim on and around the island here. If they fight and begin to lose, they make a break to the east, hoping to lure their foes into the path of the sea drakes that live in the pool in area 3.

#### Garbage Island

The small island is covered in the detritus of sightless living. Beneath the filth and bones are the remains of a spelunker the grimlocks killed, who carried a [climber's kit](Mechanics/items/climbers-kit.md) and [50 feet of silk rope](Mechanics/items/silk-rope-50-feet.md).

### 3. Drake Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The water is eerily still and frigid here. The only way in or out of this domed chamber is through the waterway back to the small island.
^0f5

Four [sea drakes](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/sea-drake-ghloe.md)* make their home in this tiny freshwater lake. They spar with the grimlocks, occasionally catching them and just as often getting caught themselves. They attack any humanoids (including the characters and grimlocks) who enter their lair. The sea drakes pursue enemies back to the small island but ignore targets that escape onto land or who climb the wall back to area 1.

#### Buried Treasure

One previous, tentative expedition to deal with the dawndrinker was fated to end here. Two skeletons sit at the bottom of the lake, twenty feet below the surface. While most of their gear is waterlogged, rusted, and worthless, a pristine [+1 flail](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) sits with the bones.

### 4. Slow Rise

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a 20-foot climb down behind you. Ahead of you, a passage opens and meanders away into the darkness.
^0f9

The walls here are high compared to the rest of the cavern—likely beyond the range of any light sources the characters are carrying (though they may get creative). The slope rises five feet by the time it reaches the base of area 5, then another five feet as it encounters the first of the stalagmites and stalactites in area 6.

Unless the characters are entirely silent, they draw the attention of the horror flits in area 5 when they pass by. Those with a passive Perception of 15 or higher (or who succeed at an active DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check) note that bat guano, a common occurrence in caves, is thicker and more common here than it has been in the rest of the cavern.

#### Scale the Wall

Characters who want to scale the 40-foot-tall wall to get to area 5 can do so with successful DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks.

### 5. Horror Flit Nest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The bones of countless fish and small game are nested among clear signs of larger kills.
^0fd

Three [horror flit hunters](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/horror-flit-hunter-ghloe.md)* here have gotten by on the natives of the caverns, including poaching the occasional explorer and grimlock, after they feasted on bats that once made their home in the caverns. The dead bats are the source of the guano in area 4.

#### Treasure

Characters who seek out the horror flits' nest discover several spiked bone clubs (from grimlock meals) along with a belt pouch containing a handful of pearls (worth 250 gp total), assorted loose coins totaling 82 sp and 57 cp, and a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [burning hands](Mechanics/spells/burning-hands.md).

### 6. Unsteady Stalagmites

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage opens wider here, but the ceiling drops to a comparatively claustrophobic ten or twelve feet overhead. Stalagmites and stalactites make this stone forest resemble an enormous gaping, crooked-toothed maw. The steady plip of water dripping from the ceiling and splashing on the floor is nearly constant in this damp cavern, muffled only by the plentiful fungi that cover much of the floor and stalagmites.
^101

There are no monstrous dangers here, but a significant section of the floor that crosses over the waterway in areas 2 and 3 has grown unstable from all the water draining through the floor. Creatures with blindsight automatically detect the weakened floor and can go around it. Hugging the west wall of the tunnel (roughly a 10-foot walkway in the section over the water below) is safe and stable. The rest of the passage in the section over the water below is fragile. Characters with a passive Perception of 16 or higher notice this just before stepping on it; otherwise, succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) or DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check is needed to notice the weak floor.

Beyond the faulty floor, the passage narrows in width, but the height of the passage rises to more than thirty feet. It is here that the dawndrinker's abilities begin to extinguish magical light sources. If the characters still have a way to perceive it, they notice the passage branching off and leading to area 8. (See area 8 for access details.)

#### Fungi

The characters may be wary of the fungi, but it's harmless and edible. When the dawndrinker is not around, they are luminescent, but their light is one of the first things the dawndrinker consumed! A successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check tells a character that this fungi should be glowing, but isn't, for some reason that must be magical.

#### Floor Collapse

If two or more characters walk over the faulty section, it collapses. Characters who succeed at a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw grab the stable sides as the floor gives way and stay in area 6. Those who fail take 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage from the floor debris as it crashes into the water around them. (These characters fall 30 feet into the water below, putting them between areas 2 and 3.)

### 7. Dawndrinker Glimmercave

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The sounds of water trickling into the cavern echo faintly and persistently, giving you the impression of a grand space.
^106

The steep cliff from area 6 requires successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to navigate. A small pool of water has collected on the west wall. The passage to area 8 is gradual.

![Dawndrinker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/031-05-002.dawndrinker.webp#center)

The dawndrinker lairs here. Its blindsight means that it's aware of characters whether they fly, climb, or fall into the cavern. It uses hit-and-run tactics to claw each one to death as quickly as possible, prioritizing those with light sources first.

#### Pool

The pool of water is not deep—only a few feet—but it's large enough that smart characters may retreat into it to both slow the dawndrinker's movement (wading counts as "difficult terrain") and to hear the dawndrinker's approach before it strikes.

#### Retreat Up

Characters may think to climb away from the dawndrinker. In such a case, it uses the passage to area 8 to get the jump on the characters from behind.

#### Retreat East

Characters may discover that the passage to area 8 narrows considerably—and that retreating into it might force the dawndrinker to attack head on. Depending on the characters' abilities, this may be a useful way to contain the dawndrinker's strengths and force it to face only the character with the best AC at any given time!

### 8. Sloped Tunnel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This narrow tunnel is sloped steeply.
^10c

At the crook of the passage is the remains of the only other adventurer to get this far in search of the dawndrinker: a dragonborn paladin of Miklas. Her sword broke in the fight, and she tried to retreat here, but the dawndrinker followed and slew her.

Climbing up to this passage from area 6 (or back down to area 6 from this passage) requires succeeding at a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

#### Miklas's Gear

The dragonborn corpse wears its suit of [plate mail](Mechanics/items/plate-armor.md) armor and [shield](Mechanics/items/shield.md). Her rations are spoiled, but her backpack still holds 18 gp, 3 moonstones (each worth 25 gp) and a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [daylight](Mechanics/spells/daylight.md). There are also three empty vials, as well as an intact one holding a [potion of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md).

## Conclusion

Killing the dawndrinker allows all light sources to return to their original, normal strength. Failing to penetrate deeply enough into the lair to face the dawndrinker or allowing it to escape causes the darkness to persist and more of the region to fall into perpetual twilight.

Who sent this abomination to the region? Is an evil wizard loosing them on the world? Did something otherworldly or extraplanar crawl up from the bowels of the earth? By the time the characters return to civilization, a villain may have already taken credit for darkening the skies themselves as a show of its power and reach. If your characters are adventuring in Castinellan territory, perhaps an inquisitor will seek them out to see what they know of this arcane abomination. If they're adventuring in the Ostoyan Empire, perhaps the villagers whisper that this must be a creature that escaped The City Below.
