# 2: Faren's Rest
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 9* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Faren's Rest is a vitebriate lair for four or five 2nd-level characters.

## Background

Faren's Rest is a roadside village that grew up along a major trading route. Once, it was just an inn and tavern. Over time, it became an important waystation: a stable and a small hamlet grew up around the inn. A few generations ago, a local baron (Faren) got the bright idea to put a tax collector at the waystation. He quickly abused the tax, building a house across from the inn to keep an eye on things—along with a statue of himself as a heroic warrior. Eventually one of the baron's many enemies did him in, and Faren's Rest became independent once again.

Recently, the newest mayor of Faren's Rest, Rolant Joss, began acting strangely. In recent weeks, he's taken in an orphan child, hired bodyguards, and started talking about reviving Faren's dreaded tax.

The vitebriate is playing the role of the poor orphan child calling herself "Rose," taken in by the mayor. Rose has grown greedy in her years of avoiding discovery and sees in Rolant an opportunity to play the long game and accumulate wealth from the old tax. Eventually, she figures, the town will get mad at Rolant (or she will use up her host), and either way she will be seen as the "innocent victim" rather than an unworthy beneficiary of the wealth, and she can disappear again. Unfortunately, her domination of Rolant is making him behave very strangely, and some in town fear something is wrong.

### Set the Hook

There are a few ways the characters might be involved. The easiest is that the inn and tavern (The Outrageous Pig) is a recommended waystation for the party. Perhaps they're on the way to another adventure, or perhaps they are returning from one. When they arrive for their well-earned rest (from questing or traveling), the owner Betha Mathildis asks the party for help. She needs outsiders to talk to the mayor and try to convince him not to revive Faren's road toll and tax.

If you're worried about the players not taking the hook, have the mayor be a friend of someone in the party or even send the party to Faren's Rest to meet with the mayor. "Remind" the players that the mayor is known for being social, for his generosity, and for his verbosity.

## Lair Overview

The first time the characters see Rolant and Rose is in the mansion (area 3), but after that, they can be in Rolant's friend's home (area 8). If the characters spend more than 24 hours before solving the mystery and dealing with Rose, two bodyguards join Rolant and Rose.

### 1. The Outrageous Pig (Inn and Tavern)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The first floor of The Outrageous Pig is a subdued but cozy roadside establishment. The fireplace roars and crackles, and the barkeep clinks glasses as he buses the bar. A matronly woman leans over the bar and beckons you toward her.
^042

**Betha Mathildis** (NG, female human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) is the matronly woman. Five regulars sit at tables waiting for food, two more stand at the bar, the cook and waiter work in the kitchen, and upstairs three traveling merchants rest in two of the five rooms (all [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) except the [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) Ardel).

Betha invites the characters to dine for free if they'll handle a small errand: she has been hoping for some competent-looking outsiders to give Rolant Joss (LG male human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), dominated by the [vitebriate](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/vitebriate-ghloe.md)*, Rose) a reminder that Faren's tax is a gross injustice by delivering him only a portion of the meals he ordered. Betha is more than willing to share her positive opinion about Rolant (and how he has changed recently), and if the characters ask what might have changed him, the only thing she can think of is adopting Rose. She insists the characters investigate. If the characters want to haggle or insist on further payment for the errand, she informs them that The Outrageous Pig is the only inn for miles, and she won't give them a room if they won't help.

She's serious about the food and the room; once the characters agree to help, she sells them two or three discounted rooms (two beds per room) at a rate of 3 sp per room along with the promise that if they figure out what's wrong with Rolant, she'll comp the rooms entirely.

#### Ardel Bigring

One of the people getting a drink at the bar is Ardel Bigring. He and his family live next to the inn. If the characters talk to him, he invites them back to his home to meet his wife and talk there—he thinks Betha's mistrustful talk might be bad for the public to hear, but he's happy to talk in private.

### 2. Stables

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The strong, sharp scent of horse dung and hay permeate these stables. A few post-horses and some work animals are quartered here.
^046

The stable boy, Merk (N, male human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) child) tends the horses and has a blooming black eye. He is reluctant to say where he got it, but a successful DC 10 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check reveals that Rolant hit him this morning for being "too slow" to prepare a riding horse for his little girl Rose. He's never been hit by Rolant before, and he thinks it must be the fluke of a bad mood. Merk is authorized to rent workhorses at 5 sp per day.

#### Helpful Merk

Merk is a nice kid, but extremely gullible—and he idolizes Rolant. If the characters tell him that Rolant said to do something, he believes them without question and does his best to carry it out.

### 3. Faren's Mansion

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The outside of this three-story brick house is overwrought with fine details. The four corners each have decorative edges and statues of imposing angels, the windows are tall and uniform, and the bricks themselves are of a deeper shade of bruised purple than the bright red of the inn. The interior is compact but aggressively opulent, as if someone decided to furnish a home three times this size and put all the furniture in the same room.
^04a

Rolant Joss (N, male human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) and the [vitebriate](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/vitebriate-ghloe.md)* Rose are both on the first floor. While meeting the characters, Rose tries to achieve her goals without completely eroding the people's trust in Rolant as their mayor.

Characters who arrive at the "mansion" with dinner from Betha are admitted immediately. It's easy to see that Rolant doesn't match Betha's description of him. The first time they meet him and Rose, have the characters make a Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check:

- **0+.** Rolant is not as he was described.  
- **5+.** He is gaunt and taciturn.  
- **10+.** He seems lethargic, even sickly.  
- **15+.** His eyes are glazed and dead. Everything he does seems to be stiff and deliberate, like a puppet on a string.  
- **20+.** Something is clearly controlling his words and actions.  

No amount of talk persuades him to change his mind about the tax. Though he's a bit sluggish in his responses, his words are concise and unyielding.

#### Rose, the Vitebriate

Rose has managed to secret a gem worth 67 gp in a purse hidden on her person. Wherever she is killed, this purse remains even after she crumbles into a swarm of harmless roaches.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check reveals two details about Rose that are striking. Although she wears fine silk clothes, flecks of moss cling to the cuffs of her blouse. Additionally, although she is very clean and tidy, flecks of rust sit beneath her nails. The moss is from hiding a ring beneath the statue (area 4) and the rust is from the bucket in the well (area 5).

If the characters want to focus on Rose, have them make a Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check:

- **0–13.** She is a frightened little girl.  
- **14–18.** She may be hiding behind Rolant, but she is fierce and focused.  
- **19–23.** She neither holds nor carries herself like a child. She seems annoyed that you're here.  
- **24+.** Something is clearly off about her—she's not human, and she's armed with a hidden dagger.  

#### Orb of the World

An expensive-looking orb, representing the world as an Arch Seraph wants it to be, is on the dining table as a centerpiece. The orb is made of solid steel and can be used as a club. If threatened here, Rose orders Rolant to use it to defend them. (It uses the same stats as a [dagger](Mechanics/items/dagger.md) but change the damage from piercing to bludgeoning.) If taken as treasure, the orb can be sold for 10 gp.

![Vitebriate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/012-02-001.vitebriate.webp#center)

### 4. Defaced Statue of Faren

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This covered gazebo houses a disproportionately muscular stone statue of a human man. The base of the statue has been inscribed with: "Faren, Conquering Wart—" The words clearly once read "warrior," but have been chiseled out. The face of the statue has been similarly broken.
^04f

#### The Statue

Characters who investigate the statue might recall two things. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check, characters learn the information from the first paragraph of the "Background" section. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, characters learn that the statue has been defaced for decades—even the exposed defacements show signs of erosion and a lack of dust or debris.

#### Hidden Cache

A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals a hole at the base of the statue covered with moss. Rose stole a silver toe ring (worth 20 gp) from Zila Bigring and hid it here to use in case she needed to flee the area quickly.

### 5. Well

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This deep well serves as a source of water for the whole hamlet. A simple wooden winch system attached to a metal bucket draws out the water. It is dozens of feet deep.
^054

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that the underside of the metal bucket is a bit rusty. Characters checking the underside of the bucket find a silver [dagger](Mechanics/items/dagger.md) secured there, hidden by Rose after she took it from Merk. The characters can keep it, but if they return it to Merk, he is grateful. The stablemaster, if the characters do this and save the town from Rose as well, offers the characters a single [riding horse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md) as payment.

### 6. Outhouses

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This tiny wooden structure with a half-moon carved out of its door reeks of excrement.
^056

Two outhouses are marked on the map. In one of the outhouses, Rose has secured a [flask of alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md) to use in an emergency.

### 7. Wealthy Merchant's Home

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This comfortable living space has three plush chairs seated around a roaring hearth fire. A small dining area waits behind. Doors leading to a pair of bedrooms exit to the north and south, and a door at the end of a hallway leads outside.
^058

This home belongs to Ardel Bigring (LN male [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) and his family. He is a staunch supporter of Rolant. At his friend's (dominated) urging, he sent for two [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) to guard Rolant.

#### Ardel and Zila Bigring

Ardel and his wife Zila are easy to talk to and willing to discuss Rolant. Zila believes something is wrong; Ardel admits his friend is behaving strangely but believes Zila and Betha are overreacting. If the characters try to convince Ardel that something is wrong (and/or that Rose is a threat), he can be persuaded with a successful DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If Zila is present when the check is made, the characters have advantage on the roll. If Ardel is persuaded, he calls off the thug support for Rolant.

Zila also mentions that small things have gone missing from her home. Just in the last two days a small silver toe ring has gone missing. She doesn't remember when she saw it last, so it might have fallen off. But it's just as likely that someone stole it.

### 8. Ambitious Merchant's Home

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The common room of this small home has a large dining table and a corner workspace covered in ledgers and bolts of cloth. Beyond a large hearth and around the corner is the home's only bedroom.
^05c

Morwa Curwen (N female [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), a down-on-her-luck textile merchant desperate to get ahead, has agreed to help Rolant restart Faren's Tax for a small cut of the toll. Once Rolant and Rose have talked to the characters at Rolant's mansion, this is where they come to hide out and gather strength. Morwa has invited some of her family and employees to come (armed with clubs) to protect their mayor in case Betha tries to threaten him. If the characters come here to talk to Morwa or Rolant (or Rose), they must deal with a small mob of five angry [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) outside first!

However they deal with the commoners, Morwa, Rolant, and Rose remain inside; Morwa follows Rolant's lead, and Rose has no problem using Morwa to guilt the characters into staying away from her and Rolant, if possible.

#### Bolts of Cloth

The fabric on the corner table can be used as makeshift bindings to tie someone up in a pinch.

### 9. Assorted Homes

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small home has a bed, desk, chair, wardrobe, and large fireplace.
^060

Each of the buildings labeled area 9 contain similar furnishings and belong to the villagers of Faren's Rest.

### 10. Open Road

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The road through Faren's Rest is well-traveled and packed solid despite being a glorified, widened dirt path. Various buildings line the road, their chimneys lazily dusting the sky with smoke.
^062

Characters who stay on the road for a prolonged period see wagons, travelers, and even the occasional caravan clop through, roughly one each hour. Every third group passing through stops at the tavern for a meal and/or at the inn and stables for the night. Wagons are parked behind the stables when necessary.

## Conclusion

Chasing the [vitebriate](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/vitebriate-ghloe.md) "Rose" out of Faren's Rest only delays the inevitable: only killing her releases Rolant from his domination and saves the town from a slow death at the hands of the greedy creature. Assuming the characters eventually kill the vitebriate, the question is not whether they have any success, but rather what that success looks like.

If the characters fail to intervene soon enough, it's possible that Betha will be killed by Rolant's borrowed thugs. Similarly, if they kill lots of innocents who are protecting Rolant, is that really a victory? The characters may claim the title of the town's heroes, or leave a subdued, somber town behind them as it deals with the chaos wrought by their own trusting natures. If the characters kill anyone without sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, they might also find themselves wanted by the law, a bounty put on their heads.
