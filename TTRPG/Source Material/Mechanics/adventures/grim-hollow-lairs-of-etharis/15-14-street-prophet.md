# 14: Street Prophet
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 57* 

*By Greg Marks*

Street Prophet is a doomcaller lair for four or five 14th-level characters.

## Background

Kazilor the doomcaller came to a poor neighborhood to preach that the end-times are at hand and that the city's leadership has done nothing to prepare the populace. The neighborhood increasingly fell under the doomcaller's sway, and throngs gather each day to hear the prophet speak in the square in front of his storefront chapel. Daemon attacks, civil unrest, and general lawlessness are on the rise as the apparent end of the world approaches. The fall of the city seems more likely.

Kazilor claims to have been gifted a local furrier's shop and has moved his "church" inside, though he preaches from the fountain in the square outside on most days. No one knows where the furrier is or moved on to, if he even still lives. He welcomes all to share in the lamentations he leads: The world is ending. There is no future or afterlife. Enjoy what little time you have how you will and make ready for the end!

The Hearthkeepers are not happy about the formation of this cult. They have ordered Wachtmeister Nikos Hiedler to expel him and his followers. The guard sergeant has only three patrolmen under his command and doesn't think they'll be able to handle the crowd, much less the street prophet and his acolytes. Worse, he has seen the prophet's proclamations of curses and daemonic invasion come true. It's beyond the guard, but maybe, just maybe, it's something heroes could put an end to before the Hearthkeepers blame him.

### Set the Hook

The street prophet has gained a popular following. Dozens of commoners come out to see him preach while his two attractive acolytes move through the crowd handing out bread and meat. The local clergy have asked the guard to remove the street preacher, but the guards are worried about the reaction of the crowds and turn to instead to adventurers to handle the situation.

#### Alternate Hook

If the characters are friendly with a reoccurring low-station NPC, they have gone missing while in the vicinity of the doomcaller and are currently being held in area 4. If the party doesn't rescue them soon, they become the next free meal prepared for the crowd!

## Lair Overview

During the day, Kazilor, wrapped in bandages and robes, climbs the fountain in the street and begins haranguing passersby. By midday, a crowd forms. Kazilor's assistants Klanssa and Alezc hand out bread and meat while accepting donations. When night falls, a few are invited to join them inside for a worship service, though no one can say what they worship, and those who go rarely tell the tale (since few get out alive).

The descriptions below assume the characters arrive while it's light, and the fiends are not aware the characters are coming. The GM should adjust if that is not the case.

### 1. Fountain Square

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A man wrapped in rags and a dirty robe stands atop the square's fountain, preaching to throngs of commonfolk. Decrepit buildings, some boarded up but a few still sporting businesses struggling to hold on, ring the square overflowing with people.
^326

During the day, Kazilor the [doomcaller](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/doomcaller-ghloe.md)* stands atop the fountain wall, walking around as he preaches to the crowd. His acolytes Klanssa ([succubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/succubus.md)) and Alezc ([incubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md)) polymorphed into human forms move through the crowd, feeding them and offering words of kindness. Both Klanssa and Alezc carry [potions of supreme healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-supreme-healing.md).

If anyone challenges Kazilor or threatens to disperse his crowd, he has a shaking fit and warns that evil approaches before pointing to the roof of one of the neighboring buildings, and summoning `1d4` [lenchtahgs](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lenchtahg-ghloe.md)* (area 6). Kazilor and his acolytes use the confusion the attack creates to flee into their storefront chapel. Once out of sight, Kazilor's first action is to use [gate](Mechanics/spells/gate.md) to summon a fiend listed in his book (area 3) into the square.

> **The Words of the Prophet Kazilor**
> 
> "Listen well, children, for time grows short. The world's end draws near, and the veil between worlds thins. Already fiends of the underworld stalk us day and night, hungering for your souls. But in forsaking hope there is a chance to live in joy for but a little longer. There is no afterlife. There is nothing else but here and now. Should you escape the fiends' hunger that the nobles do not protect you from, at world's end your soul shall fray and wither away. Live as you would. Those in power would tell you your place is in the dirt, is to toil for their gain. It is not so! Take what you desire. Live as you wish. For what is chaos but the freedom to live in elation. Embrace pleasure for pleasure's sake, and care not for the rigid society those in power would impose. Nothing matters but what you desire!"

#### Crowd

On an average day, `5d20` [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) come to listen to Kazilor preach. They crowd into the small square and fill the surrounding streets. Some climb onto surrounding buildings or hang from windows. Consider the entire area to be difficult terrain while the crowd is present. Three [downcast mercenaries](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/downcast-mercenary-ghloe.md)* in the crowd are [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Klanssa, Alezc, and Ilsoa to act as bouncers, keeping the crowd from being too disruptive during the sermon.

If combat breaks out, the crowd confusedly tries to flee in every direction for five rounds. In addition to the difficult terrain, any creature in the square or surrounding streets must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw if they move on their turn or be knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). Creatures that are [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) at the start of their turn suffer 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. Several commoners are trampled to death.

#### Fountain

The fountain is surrounded by a 4-foot-high wall made of marble and can be crouched behind to take cover. Water cascades out of the top and over three successively larger tiered bowls in a classic stacked configuration. The water is pure and drinkable.

#### Neighboring Shops

Several shops front onto the square and surrounding streets. Half are boarded up and abandoned. Other nearby shops include a chandler, a baker, and canvas maker. The surrounding blocks are a significant fire hazard.

### 2. Storefront

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The front area of the former shop is now largely abandoned. Empty racks and a lone counter are all that remain of the former furrier's establishment. A door leads to a back room.
^32d

When this was an active shop, this room displayed wares and had a corner where the furrier would take orders or accept pieces to be repaired. The cracked window still reads "Schilnd's Furrier, Sales, Commissions, and Repairs" in flaking gold paint.

#### Counter

Under the counter is a small, sealed wooden box that has been nailed to the underside of the counter and filled with an alchemical device. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notes that a wire connects the box to the door leading to area 3. A character that beats the DC by 5 or more also locates a hidden switch also under the counter. If the door to area 3 is opened without flipping the hidden switch, the wire opens the box and exposes it to air causing it to explode and do 22 (`4d10`) fire damage to all creatures in area 2. The trap can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

#### Front Door

The front door is locked (DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check to unlock). Kazilor carries the only key. The door can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength check. The window can be easily smashed, though it makes a lot of noise and is easily heard for blocks.

### 3. Chapel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A symbol is crudely painted on the southern wall above a low dais and podium. Offerings are piled around the podium. There are two doors exiting the small chapel.
^332

This former workroom has been cleaned out to make room for a small chapel. After sundown Kazilor leads worship services, where he preaches persuasively to throw off the shackles of morality and order, encouraging receptive audiences to do anything they want since the world is about to end. Anyone not receptive is asked to stay after the indoctrination session and invited for additional discussions in area 4. When not preaching or otherwise causing havoc, the fiends rest in this room.

#### Offerings

The offerings of the desperate are packed around the podium. Sacks of coins and jewelry (worth 273 gp), food, crafts, clothing, and the detritus of lives abandoned in anticipation of the end of the world.

#### Podium

On a shelf under the podium is a small book written in Abyssal containing lists of names: congregants that have fully embraced the doomcaller's message, missing people that have been killed and fed to the crowds, and a short list of fiendish true names including Malfikan, Allonassa, Rawnivour, and Ixixxitollan. These can be any kind of fiend the GM wishes to use in the campaign.

A successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check while searching the podium locates a hidden switch that deactivate the trap in area 2 before opening the door.

#### Symbol

The runes painted on the wall are Abyssal runes associated with chaos. Looking closely and succeeding on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes that a [symbol of death](Mechanics/spells/symbol.md) (spell save DC 18) worked into it. The symbol triggers when a humanoid is in the room for more than three rounds without a fiend present.

### 4. Abattoir

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Hacked and bloody bodies are piled in front of cooking hearth, and butchering tools hang on the wall over a low cabinet. A reinforced and barred door exits the building to the west.
^338

Ilsoa the [infernal tormentor](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/infernal-tormentor-ghloe.md)* plies her trade as a chef here, making the bread and meat that Klanssa and Alezc hand out. All the food is made from, or otherwise tainted by, the bodies of those they abduct. If Ilsoa knows that non-fiends are in the building, she casts [alter self](Mechanics/spells/alter-self.md) to appear as a tied-up victim so she can either surprise would-be rescuers or escape if things turn against Kazilor. Ilsoa has a [rod of security](Mechanics/items/rod-of-security.md) that is sometimes brought out for special services in the chapel.

#### Alley Door

The door to the alley is locked. It can be unlocked with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check or broken down with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Both Kazilor and Ilsoa have keys to this door.

#### Bodies

Recently collected street people, congregants that would not be missed, or those that asked too many questions, have been killed and stacked here. Several have been partially butchered and are currently cooking in the hearth.

### 5. Abandoned Shop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The original purpose of this abandoned shop is no longer determinable. Three bedrolls are spread out on the floor.
^33d

At night, the three [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) [downcast mercenaries](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/downcast-mercenary-ghloe.md)* sleep in the abandoned shop. A night one of them stands watch in case Kazilor needs them.

### 6. Summoning Shop

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Inside the boarded-up shop, light pours in through a hole in the ceiling illuminating a circle of magical runes and half burned candles.
^33f

Kazilor uses this shop for summoning fiends, and potentially binding them within the prepared circle. If there is trouble, he summons [lenchtahgs](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lenchtahg-ghloe.md)* to this location.

## Conclusion

![Lenchtahg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/101-14-006.lenchtahg.webp#center)

Defeating Kazilor and his fiends brings a measure of stability to the neighborhood, but unrest remains and eventually leads to riots by the disaffected. Reading through Kazilor's book identifies those who are fully converted to his apocalyptic teachings, including at least one highly placed noble. The characters find the name of Ulsam March among the list of the fiend's converts. Ulsam is the son of Countess March who is well placed in court. Attempting to bring him to justice is a difficult task indeed if the characters don't wish to run afoul of the powerful noble.

Among the bodies in area 4, one carries a map to the fabled ordeal tree, potentially connecting this adventure to the Swamp of Fate.
