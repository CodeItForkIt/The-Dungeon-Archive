# 4: Apostate Temple
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 17* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Apostate Temple is a bloodbonded lair for four or five 4th-level characters.

## Background

After turning on both Arch Seraph Solyma and Arch Daemon Venin, a bloodbonded (known to its followers as "the Holy One") has used its twisted lies to gather desperate villagers to the ruins of this forgotten temple. With its cult growing, the bloodbonded orders raids on shrines of the "false" gods, preaching the end of the dominion of Seraphs and Daemons alike. The temple's remote location proves perfect for the Holy One's efforts. Its followers have constructed makeshift storehouses, barracks, and even special chambers for the Holy One itself.

In the temple's sanctuary, the bloodbonded and its followers have knocked over the statue of the discarded god once revered here and marked the sanctuary with both sacred and profane symbols. In its madness, the bloodbonded hopes to summon and bind minor celestials and infernals to its cause. While its conjuring is so far ineffective, given sufficient time and effort it will succeed. Prisoners and willing volunteers wait in cages to be sacrificed.

### Set the Hook

A local village, temple, or ruler may hire the characters to seek out the bloodbonded's temple and deal with its inhabitants because of the danger they pose. The characters may have received a vision from a seraphic (or daemonic) entity asking them to deal with the threat. A priest or other holy person might mandate the characters to silence the apostate and scatter its followers. The characters may be exploring a dense and unpopulated forest or a lofty and barren mountain, stumbling across the ruins. If a more personal reason is needed, have the characters track the bloodbonded's followers after an abduction; the bloodbonded is stealing people to sacrifice for its dark purposes.

The temple is designed to be viable in any location: mountain, tundra, forest, mire, etc.â€”wherever it would make sense that temple could be tucked away undisturbed and forgotten! If it's near a civilized area, the cages in the sanctuary are likely more populated. If not, fewer cages have prisoners.

## Lair Overview

Assume that most of the roof that once covered the stylobate has fallen in, leaving all but the raised sanctuary platform partly exposed to the elements and sunlight during the day. The colonnades are almost entirely intact. Only a pair of large supporting columns in the northwest of the temple have collapsed outward, causing part of the stylobate and roof to collapse along with it.

The site is divided into two major areas: the main temple stylobate (where all the bloodbonded's followers live and where they've built their ramshackle shelters), and the temple's sanctuary. The stylobate level is 15 feet from ground level. The sanctuary is an additional 25 feet above (for a total of 40 feet from ground level). The stylobate level is open on all sides. The sanctuary level is enclosed in a thin stone wall except for the stairs that lead in from the west and a set of eleven 5-foot-diameter circular openings that rest 20 feet above the sanctuary floor. The steeply pitched roof of the sanctuary (intact after the collapse of the main roof over the whole temple) is another 20 feet above the top of the openings.

### 1. Stylobate Base

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the top of the stairs, the stylobate of this ancient temple stretches before you. A few watchfires and four makeshift structures occupy the space. Up another stair flight several dozen feet away, an intact inner sanctuary rises from the base.
^0b3

Three [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) are on guard here near the watchfire. They are supposed to be actively watching the stairs leading up the stylobate, but they're sitting around the fire instead. At the first sign of trouble, they run to the barracks and toward the sanctuary to fetch help.

#### Watchfires

These low fires shed 30 feet of bright light and an additional 30 feet of dim light. They are the only consistent light source on the stylobate level.

### 2. Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thirty-six bunked beds are crammed into this tight space, triple-stacked. The stench of sweat and unwashed bedding spill out of these barracks.
^0b7

Twelve [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) are resting and relaxing at any given time in the barracks. Their armor is in the armory (area 4), meaning if fighting here they only have an AC of 10, but they do keep their scimitars with them.

#### Footlockers

Small lidless fruit crates have been nailed to the bunks to form open-shelved footlockers for the cramped cultists. Most have a change of clothes, eating utensils, or hardtack, but one has secreted away a small gold bracelet worth 25 gp.

### 3. Storeroom

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This confined shed is stuffed to the brim with barrels, jars, and crates. It smells of flour and brine.
^0bb

The camp cook (N female [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) named Uliri) is taking inventory in this space. She is unarmed and unarmored but does carry a manifest of the space's contents. She wears a blood-and-vegetable-stained apron. She carries one of the two keys to the bloodbonded's chambers. (The other is on the bloodbonded itself.)

#### Food Supplies

There are more than enough nonperishable supplies here to replenish up to twenty days' worth of rations.

### 4. Armory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A motley collection of leather armor is stacked in piles on the floor. Piles of pebbles and strips of fabric sit alongside a few crossbows, blades, and shields along the walls.
^0bf

An [eldritch priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/eldritch-priest-ghloe.md)* named Blarrie who's given his allegiance to the bloodbonded is stationed here to parcel out armor to cultists. If fighting lasts for more than a round in area 1, he leaves the armory to investigate.

#### Weapons and Armor

The arms and armor here are of poor quality. Twenty sets of [leather armor](Mechanics/items/leather-armor.md), a dozen [slings](Mechanics/items/sling.md) and a hundred pellets, four [longswords](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), five [scimitars](Mechanics/items/scimitar.md), and two [light crossbows](Mechanics/items/light-crossbow.md) (no bolts) are here for the taking.

### 5. Bloodbonded Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Unlike the rest of the camp, this shed's floor is covered in a patterned rug, its walls lined with tapestries, and a central candelabra quietly illuminates a desk and chair, bookcase, and soft-looking bed.
^0c3

The door to these quarters is locked. The bloodbonded (if not here, see area 7) carries one of the keys and the camp cook (see Area 3) carries the other. Breaking down the door requires a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Picking the lock requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

The [bloodbonded](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bloodbonded-ghloe.md)* sleeps here for four hours each day, preferring to do most of its work during nighttime hours. Almost all its other waking time is spent in the sanctuary.

#### Books and The Mad Treatise

Most of the books the bloodbonded has acquired are written in Celestial and center on superstitions and folktales that are 90 percent fiction and 10 percent fact. They are dry grimoires with no literary value or illustrations. Only one book on the shelves stands out from the rest: The Mad Treatise. When the bloodbonded hits a dead end in its summoning attempts, it spends some time adding to its experimental log. The Mad Treatise is a lightly enchanted magic item (conjuration) and can be used as an arcane focus. Any spellcaster who uses the tome as its arcane focus and casts a conjuration spell that conjures at least one creature can choose one of the summoned creatures to be summoned with 5 "temporary hp".

#### Chest

The collected valuables of the camp are stored in an unlocked chest: 2,800 cp, 1,300 sp, and 60 gp.

#### Furnishings

The wall tapestries are faded and have been splattered with blood, defacing the sacred and profane themes that once played across them. The rug is similarly dirty and ripped, though still soft. The desk and chair are rudimentary, having neither arms nor drawers.

### 6. Sanctuary Stairs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> These taller-than-average stairs were made for creatures twice or three times the size of a human. They ascend to the sanctuary above.
^0c9

A pair of [eldritch priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/eldritch-priest-ghloe.md)* guard these stairs from inside the sanctuary. If they see fighting in area 1, they warn the bloodbonded and then go assist their allies two rounds later.

#### Large Stairs

These extra-tall, extra-wide stairs are almost too large to ascend without climbing. They are treated as "difficult terrain" for any creature smaller than Huge.

### 7. The Sanctuary

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This enormous space is a perfectly crafted, artificial primordial forest. Lit only by torch set in sconces at intervals along the walls, the lights flicker and dance across the smooth walls and ceiling. An array of columns, symmetrical but staggered, forego the entasis of the exterior columns in favor of attenuation that leaves large bases and shrinks as they ascend. As they approach the ceiling, the columns branch into funnel shapes like great abstract trees. The ruined rubble of a toppled colossal statue that once stood in the chamber's center fades away into the darkness in the northeast.

![Bloodbonded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/025-04-002.bloodbonded.webp#center)

The [bloodbonded](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bloodbonded-ghloe.md)* and its six closest followers ([commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)), as well as two other sycophants ([cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md)), are gathered in this space, creating a summoning circle for the next conjuring attempt.

#### Profane Summoning Circle

A complicated set of artistic shapes are inscribed in blood on the floor in a 15-foot-diameter area. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognize the general arrangement and layout of the shapes as a circle of daemon summoning. However, this one has druidic symbols merged with it. Stepping voluntarily onto this circle without having dealt damage to another creature in the last round causes a character to take 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. This effect can trigger once per creature per round.

#### North-Side Altar

This altar has been horribly defaced and smashed with a large heavy object. Only the top of the altar remains intact. A copper chalice with gold filigree rests atop it, filled with dried blood. The chalice (cleaned of blood) is worth 25 gp.

#### Statue Ruins

It is difficult to determine what this statue looked like before its fall. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check determines that this statue depicted a four-winged seraphic figure wearing a crown and holding a scythe. Characters proficient with mason's tools have advantage on this check.

#### East Main Altar

This altar has been horribly defaced with a caustic agent. It was once lovingly painted but is now pocked and discolored. A silver ewer filled with acid rests on the altar. The acid from the ewer acts as using a [vial of acid](Mechanics/items/acid-vial.md) in combat. If the acid is cleaned out, the ewer is worth 30 gp.

#### Sacred Summoning Circle

A set of overlapping geometric shapes are roughly chiseled into the floor. The shapes are obscured by four dismembered body parts and the blood that accompanies them: two hands and two feet are spaced as if the body that connected them has been removed. The shapes cover a 15-foot-diameter area. Characters who succeed at a DC 14 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognize the general shape and layout of the shapes as a circle of seraphic summoning. However, the body parts and blood would not normally be part of such a ritual. Stepping voluntarily onto this circle without having dealt damage to another creature in the last round causes a character to take 7 (`2d6`) radiant damage unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. This effect can trigger once per creature per round.

#### South-Side Altar

This altar has been left entirely intact but is frustratingly bereft of art or pigmentation that would help divine its purpose or dedication. A pair of cloth-of-gold vestments have been folded meticulously on the altar, each worth 20 gp.

#### Cages

Depending on your comfort level and the comfort level of your players, these cages can be stocked with animals the cultists have caught, by dead prisoners they've recently killed, by living hostages, by living voluntary sacrifices, or by living involuntary sacrifices. There are four cages, each one large enough to comfortably contain a Medium-sized creature.

## Conclusion

Killing the bloodbonded is the only way to guarantee that its cult does not survive to trouble civilization again. Chasing it off is a half-measure. If the characters have been contracted to rescue captives (or if they merely witnessed a kidnapping and set out to track the abductors), freeing the prisoners in the cages and getting them to safety qualifies as success as well. If the prisoners are killed (perhaps in a failed hostage negotiation), that reflects poorly on the characters. Similarly, the bloodbonded's closest followers (the commoners) are brainwashed. To earn the most respect from their employers, the characters should allow as few commoners as possible to perish defending their monstrous leader.

Depending on which path led the characters to the ruins, this can start several other adventures: perhaps the temple was built over a dungeon even more ancient than the ruins, and some of the cultists flee into its depths with a prisoner. Perhaps this bloodbonded, with its dying breath, reveals that its plans are already in motion and its death won't stop themâ€”what could those plans be? Other, more powerful bloodbonded may still be out there, and tracking them down to save a church or temple the characters value could also be a follow-up!
