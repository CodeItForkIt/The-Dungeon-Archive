# 6: Boulderwood Path
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 25* 

*By Tom "Evhelm" Donovan*

Boulderwood Path is a lupilisk lair for four or five 6th-level characters.

## Background

The Boulderwood was named for its large stone outcroppings, but now that name takes on a more sinister tone for the stony fate that befalls travelers on its dangerous paths. A pack of lupilisks recently moved into this dense forest, stopping trade and cutting off communication between realms on either side.

Recently, a very important set of three signed treaties were being sent by disguised courier from one regent to another. These signed documents refreshed a century-old peace treaty, and if they are not delivered soon, these regents may find themselves at war.

The courier was sent through the Boulderwood and has not returned; it is feared she was attacked. Now someone must go and retrieve the documents (and deliver them to the eastern regent) before war breaks out.

### Set the Hook

A desperate western regent (or her agent, perhaps a captain of the guard or trusted advisor) tells the characters a rough outline of the information laid out in the Background. The characters' primary mission is to recover the signed and sealed documents (if possible) and the secondary mission is to determine what happened to the courier. Is the courier a traitor? Is there foul play involved? Is this just an accident?

Alternately, the characters may be traveling through the Boulderwood on another quest altogether; perhaps they are hunting lupilisks to make [periapts of proof against poison](Mechanics/items/periapt-of-proof-against-poison.md), or maybe this is just the fastest way to get where they're going, and they stumble onto the lupilisks and the remains of the courier's disastrous mission.

## Lair Overview

The characters arrive on the road from the west at area 1. This deep in the Boulderwood, the tree canopy is very thick. The rocky outcroppings here have led to fewer taller, stronger trees, so the canopy is still all encompassing but light does pass through.

The lupilisks stumbled across a great bounty with the attack on the courier. Between the horses, the courier, and the courier's guards, the entire pack has been eating well for days, supplemented with the occasional stray forest creature. As such, most of the lupilisks are lazing in their respective nests and hangouts.

The eye crows in area 6 have peers all around the lair, watching to ensure the treaty pieces are not recovered. Characters with a passive Perception of 17 or higher notice the unusual number of birds watching them as they travel the lair, as do any characters who actively search the trees and succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

When the characters have investigated any two of the areas and are on their way to a third, a pack of gnolls (four [beast gnolls](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/beast-gnoll-ghloe.md)*, two [venomous gnolls](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/venomous-gnoll-ghloe.md)*, and two [gnoll brutes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll-brute-ghloe.md)*) arrives at area 3, traveling the road toward area 1. They make a ruckus, destroying the ruined cart and devouring the rations and supplies the forest animals haven't gotten into unless stopped by the characters. The gnolls carry their plunder from other travelers and adventurers they've killed. The treasure they carry includes 147 gp of random items and coins, as well as a bronze coronet with the word "blessed" inscribed in elegant Celestial worth 250 gp.

### 1. Forest Path

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After hours of trudging down this dark forest path, you find yourself staring down at the statue of a horse that's been tipped over onto its side in the middle of the road. Strangely, it's missing a leg and tail, but the missing pieces aren't nearby.
^12e

One of the two cart horses from the courier's wagon was turned to stone when the lupilisks attacked. They ate its foreleg and tail, leaving the rest for later. The rest of the wagon, along with the other horse, courier, and two guards made it to area 3 before succumbing.

#### Stone Horse

Characters who investigate the horse with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discover that the statue is of impeccable workmanship, displaying the animal rearing back. It even has bridles and a broken yoke carved with symbols of the western regent. Those who suspect the horse was turned to stone (rather than being an artificial statue) can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)). A success recalls stories of fantastic fiends called [lupilisks](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-ghloe.md) whose venom—which grows stronger as the creature ages—petrifies its prey. Characters who succeed by 5 or more also recall that lupilisks tend to hunt in packs and are often led by the oldest and most powerful among them.

#### Path

Characters who succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check can pick out a set of wagon wheel tracks that indicate the wagon picked up speed here. Those who succeed by 5 or more know that the speed increase was uncontrolled and unsafe.

### 2. Watering Hole

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Past the rocks, the air here is slightly warmer thanks to the break in the trees afforded by the pool in this swale.
^133

Six [lupilisk whelps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-whelp-ghloe.md)*, a [lupilisk](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-ghloe.md)*, and a [lupilisk elder](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-elder-ghloe.md)* are here: three whelps are curled up napping while the others are drinking at the pool. The lupilisk elder was injured in the fight against the courier's group and is at half its hit points. Even with the elder's weakened condition, this can be a very difficult encounter!

#### Rocky Area

The raised area that separates the pool's surroundings from the forest path is "difficult terrain". Characters can use this to their advantage to slow the lupilisks!

#### Pool

The water is cool and clean to drink. It is 10 feet deep at its deepest point.

#### Treasure

The napping whelps had just finished a stony meal. A stone hand and a metal scroll case (one of the three pieces of the treaty) are all that remain of this courier guard.

### 3. Ruined Wagon

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A capsized wagon with a broken wheel blocks the path.
^139

A cursory search confirms that this is the missing courier's wagon, bearing the emblems of a trading house instead of the regent's seal to avoid suspicion. Flight of any kind is a great way to stay out of reach of the lupilisks; however, staying airborne or sticking to the treetops for too long draws the attention of two [sky drakes](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/sky-drake-ghloe.md)*.

#### Wagon

To establish the courier's cover, she was given several crates filled with jars of flour. The wreck of the wagon has broken most of the jars, and the crates are leaking flour. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival) or [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check reveals that the wagon capsized after being chased by at least ten quadrupedal creatures. A successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that some of the rocks on the road are not rocks at all, but pieces of another horse statue. Succeeding at either of these checks, or spending 10 minutes searching, reveals no lockbox or other suitable safe place for the treaty; the treaty pieces are not here and were likely carried by the courier or her guards.

### 4. Elder Mount

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From this high vantage point, you can see down the path to where you first encountered the stone horse and began your investigation. A rocky projection juts up from this hillock, blocking your view of the rest of the path.
^13d

A [lupilisk elder](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-elder-ghloe.md)* and two [lupilisk whelps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-whelp-ghloe.md)* are resting here and attack the characters on sight. Loud fighting here draws the creatures from area 5 into the fight after `1d3 + 1` rounds.

#### Climbing

Climbing or descending the gentle slope on the eastern side of the hillock does not require a check but is considered "difficult terrain". To ascend or descend the steeper three sides of the hillock requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The hillock is 30 feet above the forest floor.

#### Treasure

Near a petrified boot lies a necklace (an [amulet of proof against detection and location](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md)) and the second piece of the treaty in a scroll case. This is the final resting place of the courier.

### 5. Hillside Nest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The detritus of a large animal haunch is nestled under a large tree in the lee of this hillock.
^142

This is the original and main nest of the lupilisks in the area: two [lupilisks](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-ghloe.md)* and two [lupilisk whelps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/lupilisk-whelp-ghloe.md)* are here. All four defend the nest to the death. Loud fighting here draws the creatures from area 4 into the fight after `1d3 + 1` rounds.

#### Treasure

Searching the nest for treasure yields the third metal scroll case containing the third part of the treaty. A successful DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check also yields a [ring of jumping](Mechanics/items/ring-of-jumping.md) that was hidden in the filth.

### 6. Ancient Altar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Atop this knoll rests a large worked-stone altar covered in ivy and moss. The unnerving sound of whispering seems to be all around you.
^146

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/038-06-001.eye-crow.webp#center)

The altar's original purpose is long lost, and the gods who were worshipped here long gone. However, it is a beacon to a murder of [eye crows](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/eye-crow-ghloe.md) that watches the characters. If the characters come here before finding any of the treaty scroll cases, the dozens of eye crows are in the trees all around the altar when they arrive, whispering. A DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check determines that the birds are the source of the whispering sound.

#### Climbing

Climbing or descending the gentle slope on the western side of the knoll does not require a check but is considered "difficult terrain". To ascend or descend the steeper southeast side of the hillock requires a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The knoll's crest is 30 feet above the forest floor.

#### Eyes on the Altar

If the characters arrive after collecting any or all the treaty scroll cases, a group of 12 [eye crows](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/eye-crow-ghloe.md)* fly onto the altar and stare at the characters. Characters who approach the 12 swear they hear the word "meddler" being whispered by the birds—but each character hears it in their native tongue. Attacking or moving threateningly towards the eye crows causes them to scatter to the trees (or further if pursued). However, if only a single character is present at the altar, the 12 attack, trying to pluck out the characters' eyes.

Characters who can talk to animals find that these crows have little to say to them; if compelled, the crows can reveal that they're watching to see if anyone takes the "metal tubes" (scroll cases) and who it is that takes them. They can describe a woman falconer who feeds them and trains them and to whom they deliver this information.

## Conclusion

Characters who unseal and open the scroll cases find that the treaty was written, signed, and then cut vertically, meaning that only someone who has all three pieces can truly understand all the treaty's articulations and stipulations. Characters who put the treaty together and read it find that it is exactly what the western regent said it was: a renewal of a treaty between the western and eastern regions. It is up to the characters what to do with it. Taking it back to the western regent is a halfway measure but taking it to the eastern regent may be a gamble (after all, what if the eastern regent is responsible for the attack on the courier?). In any case, opening the seals should diminish (but not negate) the reward.

This quest ends with more questions than answers: were the gnolls directed to the courier's path, or were they merely a wandering pack? Were they after the characters? The treaty? Who do the eye crows ultimately report to, and why were they whispering "meddlers"? How did so many lupilisks take up residence so quickly in an area that had been cleared of dangers sufficiently for the courier to think this route was safe? Who doesn't want this peace treaty to be re-ratified?
