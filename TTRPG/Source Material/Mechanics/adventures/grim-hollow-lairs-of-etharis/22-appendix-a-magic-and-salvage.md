# Appendix A: Magic and Salvage
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis* 

A monster hunter stalks through the overgrown forest, scanning the underbrush for signs of wild boar. By spreading a few silver coins at the local village's tavern to gain the trust and loosen the lips of reticent foresters, she learned of the potential location of a rare and dangerous gold mane boar.

The monster hunter can certainly use the meat from such a rare beast, but that's not her motive. The bristles of the gold mane boar can be suffused with magic and crafted into a light that pierces even the most powerful magical darkness. Adventurers traveling into the lairs of powerful fiends and spellcasters rely on such magic to gain an advantage.

## The Power of Salvage

Each monster in *Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis* comes with a section that describes what can be salvaged from them—either as loot to be used or sold, or as components for powerful magic items to be created and used by adventurers. The salvage listed is only the first step, however. Creative DMs can use the examples provided to imagine and implement their own ideas of what can be salvaged from a monster, and more importantly, what can be created from that salvage.

In high-magic settings, one might imagine an economy built upon powerful crafters and arcanists creating magic items to be sold to adventurers for a tremendous profit. Magic in these settings would be easily available to all—and monsters, by extension, easier to defeat.

Grim Hollow is not one of those high-magic settings. The grim and dark fantasy supported by Grim Hollow eschews those notions of countless powerful creators making magic items willy-nilly, passing them out like candy at a midwinter festival. While magic is not necessarily rare in the setting, it's also not omnipresent and easy to obtain. And it's dangerous.

## Overcoming Incredible Odds

A hallmark of dark fantasy is that the characters must rely on their wits, skill, luck, and choices to overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Survival is not a sure thing. Putting together the plans and tools for survival is an important part of the journey.

In such a world, nonplayer characters (NPCs) are not going to spend their valuable time and resources creating powerful magic items, on the off chance that some rich adventurers might come along with large amounts of gold to buy those goods. Gold can't buy safety in a world where the Great Beast may show up anytime, anywhere.

Part of the valor and resiliency of characters in a dark fantasy setting is their self-reliance—or of their dedication to finding, securing, and maintaining allies who can assist them in their struggles. That assistance is sometimes martial, but often it manifests as an ally with the ability to provide material support: a blacksmith, alchemist, armorer, sage, or some other artisan or expert.

### The Power of Survival in the Narrative

Imagine a campaign where the characters are the only thing standing between a town and some terrible threat. The monsters threatening the area may seem much more powerful than the characters can handle, yet they have no choice but to try. Too many innocent lives are at stake.

When the characters first encounter the monsters, the heroes may barely survive, and fleeing is the only option to dying. Yet in that first encounter, the characters observe the monsters, maybe learning something about the monsters through successful ability checks or by locating clues in the area around the monsters' home.

Armed with that knowledge and the clues, the characters can rely on their own expertise—or the talents of the people they're protecting—to glean some information that may provide a spark of hope. For instance, maybe the monsters are vulnerable to a certain type of toxin.

The local alchemist knows of this very rare toxin, which can be distilled from the brain matter of a beast that lives in the nearby mountains. A local guide knows of that beast's lair.

It's easy to see a whole campaign, or at least a series of adventures, built naturally from this narrative construct. But more important than the plot set up by this is the dramas—big and small—that can emerge through play.

Maybe the alchemist is herself in danger from some other foe, so she requires the characters to take the time to solve her problem before she can make the necessary toxin. Maybe the local guide is a spy for the enemy, and instead of leading them to the lair, he leads the characters astray. Time factors may also force the characters to make hard decisions. All that narrative power comes when we, as game masters, don't simply hand the characters the answers to their problems.

### Keeping Friends Close

In a setting where all the magic items and answers to problems must be worked for and crafted, NPCs become a much larger part of the campaign. A skilled weaponsmith with the necessary tools and training in arcane crafting is many times more valuable than any single magic weapon she could produce.

This heightens the characters (and their players) appreciation for, and attention to, the NPCs they encounter. NPCs are no longer cardboard cutouts that sit idly by, waiting for rescue from danger, while the heroes go about their business. The lives of these NPCs are much more important to the characters, and to the unfolding narrative of the campaign, when they have important information and assistance to offer.

NPCs, when they gain this increased importance in the success of the characters, enrich the campaign's setting. A calculating villain whose weak point can be exploited by the creations of an expert alchemist is much more likely to target the alchemist than the characters—and this brings a new dynamic to a campaign.

## Salvage and Crafting Rules

The salvage rules for monsters includes not just what can be taken from the monsters; what can be crafted with those items is also stated.

Crafting these items takes into account four elements, in addition to the salvaged components:

- Crafting time  
- Necessary proficiencies or spells  
- Ability checks  
- Other components  

Each of these elements is described in greater detail below. Remember: these elements are suggestions. Any or all of them can be changed to best fit your campaign.

### Crafting Time

The necessary time for item crafting is based on the type of item and its rarity. Items like weapons, armor, or clothing generally take longer than potions. However, powerful magic also adds complexity—and therefore time—to the crafting period. A simple potion might only take a few hours, while the most powerful arcane implement takes several days, weeks, or even months of constant work.

The length of time listed for crafting items from salvage passes whether the item is created successfully or not. The time assumes that the crafters work 16-hour days, and then take the mandatory 8 hours of a long rest.

Remember that during the time spent crafting, the crafters must still eat, rest, and take care of themselves. This might incur expenses renting space, buying food, etc. Those who aren't crafting can, of course, take steps to provide those resources.

### New Feats

If crafting is going to play an important role in your campaign, providing characters (or even NPCs) with rules-based abilities to perform crafting might be just as valuable as combat-based abilities. For example, offering feats like the ones below might be valuable:

#### Adroit Crafter

You've trained in crafting items using a skill or tool that you're proficient with, and the steps in crafting have become second nature to you. You gain the following benefits:

- The time it takes to create an item using your proficient skills or tools is halved.  
- If you fail to successfully craft the item and would lose the components, you retain the components instead.  

#### Careful Crafter

You've trained in crafting items using a skill or tool that you're proficient with, and your creations are known for being well made and reliable. You gain the following benefits:

- You make all ability checks for crafting with advantage.  
- Anyone assisting you in crafting an item gains advantage on their ability checks for crafting.  
- If you fail to successfully craft the item, the amount of time it took to complete the process is halved.

### Necessary Proficiencies or Spells

Crafting items sometimes requires a character or NPC with a certain proficiency to take part in the crafting. A person proficient with weaponsmith's tools must create the sword or mace if a magical weapon is being crafted. This proficiency is separate from the ability check that must be successfully made to craft the item.

For example, creating [arcane oil](Mechanics/items/arcane-oil-ghloe.md) from a xakalonus requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check by a proficient alchemist. If a single person meets both conditions (proficient with alchemist's supplies *AND* proficient in the [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill), they can craft the oil by themselves. However, two people can also work together if each is proficient in only one of the necessary skills or tools. In this case, they must each spend the entire time required for crafting.

### Ability Checks

The ability check associated with a crafting should be made at the end of the crafting period. If the check is a success, the item is successful crafted. On a failure, the item is not crafted successful, and all the components that went into the crafting are consumed (unless otherwise stated).

Only people who take part in the entire process, and who are proficient in the skill called for, can attempt this check. If multiple people involved are proficient with the skill, they can roll individually, or they can assist someone else, giving them advantage on the check.

Magic that provides bonuses for a limited time—such as [guidance](Mechanics/spells/guidance.md)—cannot be used to affect the ability check unless it is active for the entirety of the crafting process.

In some cases, rather than calling for a certain skill or ability check, the crafting of an item requires repeated casting of a particular spell. In these cases, someone must be available and willing to take part in the process for at least 1 hour of the day that the crafting takes place. This spell might be provided from a scroll, magic item, NPC, or some other source. Spells provided by a source other than a character might require payment, which could be in the form of coin, favors, or whatever else you can imagine that makes for a memorable story.

#### Alternative Failure System

Some players may bristle at a system where one failed check might have great repercussions in terms of time and components lost. If this is the case, a graduated failure system like the one below can take away some of the sting of failure.

**1-3 lower than DC**: No components are lost, and only half the time of crafting is spent.

**4-6 lower than DC**: Half the components are lost, and 75% of the time are spent.

**7-9 lower than DC**: All components and time is lost.

**10+ lower than DC**: All components and time are lost, and all participants gain 2 levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) (or alternative arcane mishap occurs).

## New Magic Items

The following magic items can be crafted from salvage taken from monsters found in various Grim Hollow Lairs. The process for creating them is detailed in the salvage section of the monster entry.

You can, of course, simply present these items to your players as treasure taken from enemies—or even gifted or sold by NPCs or other elements of your game. However, presenting the items rather than encouraging the players (or their NPC associates) to craft them takes away from the objective of showing how valuable skills and proficiencies are in Etharis.

### Arcane Oil

*Potion, rare*

This substance is created by distilling the jelly that encases the brain of a [xakalonus](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/xakalonus-ghloe.md). As an action, you can coat one weapon or 20 pieces of ammunition with the substance.

If the coated objects are not magical, for the next minute, your attacks with the coated weapon or ammunition gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

If the coated objects are magical, the oil does not affect attack or damage rolls with them. However, your attacks against the hraptnon can fully damage that creature for one minute.

### Brazen Armor

*Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)*

This armor, fashioned from the body of an [Empyrean brazen bull](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean-brazen-bull-ghloe.md), gleams brightly in direct sunlight. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, you have resistance to fire and radiant damage.

### Coat of Lies

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This coat made of the severed tongues of a [harvester](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/harvester-of-lies-ghloe.md)'s victims provides a +1 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks.

Additionally, as a bonus action three times per day, you can activate the magic of the cloak. If you do, the next spell you cast before the start of your next turn can be cast without any somatic or verbal components.

### Glass-Studded Armor

*Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to radiant damage. Each time a creature makes a melee attack against you, it takes 3 piercing damage. A creature can choose to make an attack with disadvantage to avoid this damage.

### Knifewing Cape

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak made from the skin of 20 [knifewings](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/knifewing-ghloe.md), you gain a +1 bonus to AC. In addition, when you fall while wearing this cloak, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.

### Lindwyrm Venom

*Potion (poison), very rare*

This terrible venom is extracted and distilled from the deadly [lindwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/lindwyrm-ghloe.md). It can be delivered via ingestion or a wound. A creature exposed to the venom must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (`8d8`) poison damage and be [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. While [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity skill checks and saving throws.

### Lycanthropy Antidote

*Potion, rare*

This silvery potion, made with [fzeg](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/fzeg-ghloe.md) blood, is dotted with flecks of red. Drinking this liquid removes the curse of werewolf lycanthropy.

### Lycan Weapon

*Weapon (any), rare*

Made from the claws, teeth, and bones of lycanthropes, these weapons are particularly effective against other lycanthropes or vampires. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

Additionally, on a successful attack against a lycanthrope, the target is forced back into its human form unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. Also, damage done to vampires with *lycan weapons* cannot be regenerated until the creature finishes a short rest.

### Ready Gunk

*Wondrous item, rare*

This sticky paste is fashioned from the powdered bone armor of a [bone trader](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/bone-trader-ghloe.md). When you treat a weapon, shield, or other item that can be wielded in one or two hands, you can use a bonus action to summon and equip it, as long as the item is within 30 feet of you. After using the magic of the paste three times, it loses its potency.

### Wand of Silence

*Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the [silence](Mechanics/spells/silence.md) spell (save DC 15). The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
