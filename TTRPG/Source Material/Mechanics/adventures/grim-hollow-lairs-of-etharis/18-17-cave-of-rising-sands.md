# 17: Cave of Rising Sands
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 69* 

*By Shawn Merwin*

Cave of Rising Sands is an hourglass widow lair for four or five 17th-level characters.

## Background

Jacoty Endak traveled the length and breadth of Etharis. He sang songs, told tales, collected stories, and survived countless adventures. Jacoty thought he'd seen and experienced everything, until he fell madly in love with a chef named Hosken Kwilleau. The two moved to a remote region of the Castellan Province to live out their lives together, sharing their love with each other and those around them.

Hosken had to return to his hometown in the Charneault Kingdom to attend to family matters, but he disappeared after leaving. Jacoty did everything in his immense power to find his lost love, but it was all for naught. Jacoty spent the rest of his life pining for Hosken, wracked with guilt and anger. When Jacoty finally died of wasting grief, even that passing failed to reunite him with his love. Jacoty was reborn as an hourglass widow.

As an undead creature that despises hope, Jacoty moves throughout the countryside, snuffing out hope and joy wherever he finds it. He's recently found an opportunity to corrupt the hopes and dreams of a werebear ascetic named Zeragonia. Zeragonia found this region suffused with lycanthropy after a visit from the Great Beast, and she established a cave complex to harbor lycanthropes trying to learn to control their affliction. An acolyte of Miklas, Zeragonia calls upon that Arch Seraph's power to aide her in healing her charges, or at least helping them control themselves.

When Jacoty learned of Zeragonia's ministrations, he found a new focus for his evil intentions. He wormed his way into Zeragonia's cavern-home, and he is using his powers to subvert Zeragonia and corrupt her followers. He's already taken control of the lair and of those whom the werebear attempted to help, and he's almost completed the process of turning Zeragonia herself to the side of darkness.

### Set the Hook

A sighting of the Great Beast in the area has led to a severe and dangerous increase in lycanthropy. While the Beast has vanished from the area, the citizens are left to deal with the aftermath. Lycanthropes ravage the area. To make matters worse, people in the region are disappearing. Others talk about experiencing lost time.

Scouts tracked some lycanthropes to a cave opening on the edges of civilization. The scouts who entered the cave never emerged, and one of the scouts left behind to watch the cave opening went mad, claiming that she'd been gone for a year when she was actually gone for no more than a couple of days. Local authorities beg the characters to investigate.

## Lair Overview

Jacoty appears in different areas of the cavern complex, depending on how he has interacted with the characters in other areas. The boxed text describes the area and the occupants, minus Jacoty's possible presence. Adjust the boxed text as needed to describe the situation you're presenting.

### Sealed Inside

Once the characters enter the mouth of the cave, Jacoty's magic takes effect, and the mouth of the cave disappears, trapping the characters inside. The following is true until the characters manage to destroy the shrine and statue of Miklas in Area 7:

- Teleportation and planar magic cannot move characters or other creatures into or out of the cave complex, although they can magically travel within the cavern complex.  
- As a bonus action, Jacoty can pop into or out of any location in his lair in the blink of an eye.  
- Mentioning the name "Hosken" to Jacoty has an obvious effect on the [hourglass widow](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/hourglass-widow-ghloe.md)*. When that name is mentioned to him, Jacoty is [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the end of this next turn with the pain of his loss. In the next turn after the stun wears off, he must physically attack the person who said the name, eschewing any tactical or magical strategy.  
- As he can affect the passage of time within his lair, Jacoty can take one long rest at any point while the characters are trapped within the caverns in less than a minute's time. He may only do this once, however. Alternately, if the characters attempt to take a long rest, Jacoty teleports in to make sure they cannot get a full rest.

### 1. Midden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stench of this room assaults the senses. Three monstrous beings hurl flayed corpses down a deep hole, while others sit at a table feasting on raw, bloody flesh.
^3c9

Seven [fzeglaich](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/fzeglaich-ghloe.md)* occupy this room, throwing the remains of their last meals down the refuse hole. They attack immediately upon seeing intruders.

#### Refuse Hole

The stench coming out of the hole is so terrible that it has taken on magical properties. Living creatures (aside from the fzeglaichs) who start their turn within 20 feet of the refuse hole must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the start of their next turn.

#### Jacoty's Presence

Early in this combat, Jacoty ([hourglass widow](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/hourglass-widow-ghloe.md)*) teleports into the area and spends a round or two attacking the characters, telling them that they are never going to leave this lair alive. After testing their mettle and taking in their tactics and capabilities, he pops away to deal with them later elsewhere in the cavern lair. He repeats this process in other areas, hounding the characters and then disappearing before he is seriously injured.

### 2. Tainted Pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber contains a large pool filled with clear water. The basin is about ten feet deep, fed by tiny cracks in the bottom that allow the water to bubble up.
^3ce

No creatures currently occupy the chamber, although if the characters wait here long enough, a few of the residents of the lair arrive to take a drink.

#### Pool

The pool contains fresh water that the residents of the lair use for survival. Jacoty's presence has caused the pool to take on corrupted characteristics in certain circumstances.

If the characters drink the water without using magic to test its potability first, it's very refreshing: provide them with inspiration. A successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check determines that the water is clean and pure.

If the characters use magic on the water, even if just to check for magic on it, the magic taints the water. Any spells determine that the water is fine, but the magic taints the water going forward. Characters that drink the water once it's tainted must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be unable to regain hit points through magical means for 24 hours.

### 3. Ill-Gotten Gains

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Chests, barrels, and sacks line the walls of this chamber. A writing desk and a table also occupy the room, covered with papers and scrolls.
^3d2

Treasure taken from the bodies of victims rest here. If the characters take at least an hour to sort through the collected goods, they find the following:

- 750 gp worth of coins, gems, jewelry, and other goods  
- 3 [potions of supreme healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-supreme-healing.md)  
- A [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [heartseeker](Mechanics/spells/heartseeker-ghloe.md).  

#### Writing Desk

The writing desk contains poems, notes, half-completed stories, and sketches. All of these were written by Jacoty, although he signed none of the works. The documents all convey a sense of loss, and the subject of the writings is a person named Hosken, who is apparently dead, although none of the work describes exactly who he was or how he died. Whoever wrote and drew these works is obviously heartbroken by the loss of Hosken.

### 4. Larder

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A floor-to-ceiling stone barricade, formed from interlocking bricks, seals off a section of this cavern. Arcane runes decorate the bricks. Faint voices echo from the other side of the brick wall.
^3d6

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/122-17-002.werewolf-ravager.webp#center)

Jacoty installed this magical brick wall to hold prisoners, used as food for the creatures who he's corrupted into becoming evil monsters. He'll occasionally come in and tell the prisoners that he's going to let them go, and then uses his magic to make them think they've been locked away for years as a way to taste their deliciously crushed hope.

#### Wall

The stone wall can magically expand or retract to block or allow access. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check reveals that the runes on the wall function as a lock. When a spell of level 1 or higher is cast on the wall, it opens for 10 seconds to allow passage. Then it closes, needing magic to re-open again. Magic cast on the wall is instantly absorbed, so spells that would affect the door do not. Each five-foot section of the wall has an AC of 25 and 200 hit points.

#### Prisoners

Currently six prisoners occupy the larder. Three are [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) who tracked the lycanthropes back to this lair. The other three are lycanthropes ([werewolf ravagers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf-ravager-ghloe.md)*) who refused to bow to the corruption of Jacoty. All of them are disoriented by lack of sustenance, as well as by Jacoty's time-distorting magic. Each can, however, describe Jacoty and call him "the devil with the hourglass body."

### 5. Barracks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This three-tiered room contains living quarters.
> 
> Six vaguely lupine figures rest here.
^3db

These six [werewolf ravagers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf-ravager-ghloe.md)*, firmly under Jacoty's control, rest while waiting for further instructions. They attack immediately unless given other instructions by their new master.

### 6. Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber holds furnishings that reveal it to be a living area for a single creature.
^3dd

Before she fell under the sway of Jacoty, Zeragonia came here to rest and reflect. The area contains utilitarian furnishings, personal effects, and a journal.

#### Zeragonia's Journal

Written in code, the journal spans the last two years and talks about Zeragonia's personal struggle with her lycanthropy, how Miklas helped her overcome the affliction, and how she created this place to safely assist others who suffer from lycanthropy to control their more violent instincts. The last entry talks about the arrival of a stranger named Jacoty who seemed troubled. Zeragonia was interested in what those troubles might be, sensing a deeper darkness dwelling within him.

In order to decipher the journal, characters must either use magic or succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

### 7. Shrine to Miklas

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A statue and shrine to Miklas dominates this chamber. Three stone columns surround a dais facing the statue. An elderly woman with white streaks in her otherwise dark hair kneels before the altar, flanked by a pair of humanoid creatures with lupine forms.
^3e1

The woman is Zeragonia, a [werebear ascetic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/werebear-ascetic-ghloe.md)*, in her human form. The two flanking her are [werewolf ravagers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf-ravager-ghloe.md)* who've already succumbed to Jacoty's control. The ravagers attack as soon as the characters approach the shrine, but Zeragonia spends the first round of combat focused on the shrine. She attacks during the next round unless the characters find a way to help her.

#### Zeragonia's Plight

If any of the characters focus on seeing what's happening with Zeragonia, they can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check (no action required). On a success, they see that the woman is highly distressed and confused as she stares at the statue of Miklas.

#### Shrine

Jacoty corrupted the shrine to slowly turn the creatures in the cavern from those who wanted to be peaceful into killers. Zeragonia is the last holdout, but she is about to be turned to the dark side. The shrine radiates strong magic, and a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) reveals that the shrine is corrupting both the attitudes of the creatures in the area, as well as the time inconsistencies that have plagued the region.

#### Deactivating the Shrine

To deactivate the shrine, the characters must perform these actions, in order. Unless otherwise noted, each of these steps requires anyone attempting them to use an action to perform the step:

- Figure out what magic is affecting the shrine (no action, noted above). This reveals the rest of the steps as well.  
- Succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to begin to sever the connection to the dark forces.  
- Succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to undo the subtle physical changes that Jacoty made to the statue.  
- Succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check to reconsecrate the statue to Miklas.  

Failing the checks in steps 2 - 4 by 5 or more results in the statue lashing out and doing `8d8` force damage to the person who failed the check.

Once the final step is completed, all of the magic of the lair stops working, making Jacoty less powerful and more susceptible to defeat by the characters. In addition, Zeragonia regains her senses and can be convinced into helping the characters fight the rest of the lycanthropes and Jacoty.

## Conclusion

If the characters can rescue and redeem Zeragonia rather than killing her, Miklas smiles upon them for showing mercy. The statue speaks, and promises to answer three questions for the characters, or provide them with one wish (as per the [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell).

If the characters defeat Jacoty, the hourglass falls out of his chest, spilling the sand that begins to flow upward. As the spirit of the poor man departs, it whispers a thanks for the release, and then asks the characters to find the fate of his love Hosken. But that's another story for another time.
