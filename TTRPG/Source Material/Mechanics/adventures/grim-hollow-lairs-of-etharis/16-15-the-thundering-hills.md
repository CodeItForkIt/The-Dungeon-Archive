# 15: The Thundering Hills
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis, p. 61* 

*By Greg Marks*

The Thundering Hills is a lindwyrm lair for four or five 15th-level characters.

## Background

Generations-old legends speak of rumbling beneath the Thundering Hills. The stories change over time, but one thing never changes: there is always a great beast called a lindwyrm, a serpent with one pair of claws and an endless appetite. The stories say, when the lindwyrm wakes, devastation always follows. The stories are wrong. There are two lindwyrms under the Thundering Hills.

Digging through the earth, the Lickscale kobold tribe came across the vast beasts and took to worshipping the century-long sleeping monstrosities. The kobolds piled small offerings around the mated pair in hopes that when they awoke, the draconic creatures grant blessings and favor to the tribe. A few weeks ago, two-thirds of the tribe was eaten the first day the pair woke, but that didn't stop the kobolds. The tribe brought more offerings, capturing wild game, farmers, and livestock to appease the lindwyrm pair which, with their hunger sated, began to tolerate the kobolds. Other than a few raids of their own against nearby villages or farms, the lindwyrms have turned their attention toward their hatching eggs. Shortly after they hatch, the lindwyrms will outpace the ability of the kobolds to feed them, and the rest of the surrounding villages will be endangered. Should an entire brood of lindwyrms spawn, the entire north will be imperiled.

### Set the Hook

The Lickscales have raided a farm, abducted the farmers, and carried off livestock. Nearby fishermen heard the commotion but, by the time they arrived, the Tolferson family had been carried away. It's clear from tracks in the snow that some humanoids attacked the farm and that at least some of the family was alive when they were taken. The Tolfersons were popular and the eldest son, Ulfrick Snow-Swimmer, was a local hero for saving two children from drowning when they feel through the ice. The adventurers are begged to follow the tracks, rescue the family, and wreck a terrible vengeance upon those who would raid the clan. Many whisper of creatures beneath the Thundering Hills, but the folk tales are rarely consistent beyond claiming a huge feral beast sleeps beneath there, its snores or restless sleep making the hills shake.

#### Alternate Hook

Young Ingrind Settur, barely nine winters, was the only survivor of an attack on her village by one of the lindwyrms. No one believes her tale of a giant serpent burrowing out of the ground, though something clearly devastated the village. She seeks the aid of heroes. She claims that before being swallowed, her father buried the family's ancestral blade into the beast's scales, and Ingrind would have it returned that she might wield it when she grows to be a warrior like her father.

## Lair Overview

The trail leads deep into the snow-covered hills to a cave that shows significant recent traffic, including something quite large coming in and out of the cave. There is no light in the caves, but a foul smell emanates from within. While rough, the ceilings are generally 20 feet high in most places.

### 1. Cave Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dark, natural tunnel descends below the hills. The ground is disturbed by the passage of many feet.
^364

While the lindwyrms can and do burrow, they frequent the natural entrance used by the kobolds. The smell of rot and offal is strong. The path proceeds down at a steep angle.

#### Tracks

A successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check identifies humanoid and kobold tracks, as well as some great serpentine beast with huge claws. The traffic is so great that it is impossible to determine exact numbers or if they last went in or out of the cave.

### 2. Windy Ravine

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel is abruptly bisected by a crevasse whose bottom is out of sight. A strong wind whips from somewhere above, making crossing the distance even more difficult. Strange graffiti is scrawled upon the walls on the other side of the crevasse.
^368

This natural fissure blocks passage. The lindwyrms are long enough to reach themselves across it, while the kobolds keep a log around the corner for crossing.

#### Crevasse

The crevasse is 15 feet across and continues out of sight in all directions. Should a creature fall, the bottom is 200 feet down. A creature with a 15 Strength can make the jump without a check, provided the violent winds don't stop them. A creature with a lower score must succeed on a Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check equal to 10 + (15â€“the character's Strength score). Should a character miss the jump, they may attempt a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to catch the opposite ledge before falling.

The Lickscales keep a long tree trunk and ropes out of sight around the corner for crossing the crevasse.

#### Graffiti

The graffiti scrawled on the walls shows crude drawings of two draconic serpents with one pair of claws surround by several small worshipping draconic creatures. Writing in poor Draconic spells out "Gods of the Lickscales" amid various rude statements.

#### Violent Winds

Random violent winds blow in all directions, making jumping or flying across the crevasse difficult. When a creature attempts to cross the crevasse, roll a `1d10`. If the result is odd, the wind pushes down, back, or sideways, impeding progress. Subtract the result of the roll to the distance jumped. If the creature is flying, they must succeed on a Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check with a DC equal to 10 plus the number rolled or take 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage as they bounce along crevasse's walls before righting themselves. If the result is even, it blows the creature up or forward, aiding progress. Add the result of the roll to the distance jumped or flown.

### 3. Burrow of the Lickscale

> [!readaloud]

> The flickering light of campfires gives away inhabitation even before the smells. Small burrows and niches, some covered by dirty blankets or scraps of leather, house many small creatures.

![Morbus Kobold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/108-15-001.morbus-kobold.webp#center)

The Lickscales live here. When the characters arrive, 20 [morbus kobolds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/morbus-kobold-ghloe.md)* are cooking, caring for young, sharpening weapons, and sorting through stolen goods. They try to hide if the adventurers make themselves known. Only Quitak Darktongue ([mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is left to speak for the tribe. Quitak is the apprentice to Shuuna Crowbiter (area 4) and as such carries some measure of respect among the kobolds. Quitak realizes that without Shuuna and her bodyguards, the tribe could easily be exterminated by most adventuring bands, so he stalls for time, welcoming them to the burrow of the Lickscales and share a campfire. He claims to have no knowledge of any monsters, thievery, or kidnappings but is happy to sit and discuss it, asking the party to tell him everything that has happened.

While he talks, one of the kobolds sneaks through the small tunnel to area 4 to alert Shuuna, who in turn goes to warn the lindwyrms. If the Tolfersons are dropped into the Nursery Pit, their screams are easily heard in this room.

### 4. Nursery Pit

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you approach a foul sulfurous smell adds to the fetid rotten meat smell that permeates the tunnels. The sounds of cracking and hissing can be heard echoing from the chamber.
^370

The lindwyrms have lain seventeen eggs and so far, two newborn lindwyrms (treat as [giant crocodiles](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md)) have hatched. Shuuna Crowbiter (kobold [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) and her bodyguards Schminge and Schux (kobold [assassins](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) are in the process feeding the newborns. They have just fed each a sheep and are about to toss the captured farmers to the newborns. If the kobolds see or hear the characters coming, or are warned, they start cutting the ropes and drop the captives as quickly as possible. If the newborn lindwyrms are harmed, their cries attract their parents (area 5).

#### Captives

There are five Tolfersons, all in bad shape from their recent violent capture: Rune, Vigdis, Ulfric (called Snow-Swimmer), Asgiern, and Natala. They are individually bound and hanging over the ledge by ropes, five feet from the ledge and ten feet above the pit floor. If they are dropped, a newborn lindwyrm can kill one per bite, but then spends a round to swallow its prey.

### 5. Lair of the Lindwyrms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this rot-stinking room is covered in bones, many of them with pieces of spoiling meat upon them. A mound of treasure and goods are heaped in the center around a makeshift altar.
^374

![Lyndwyrm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/GHLoE/109-15-002.lyndworm.webp#center)

Two [lindwyrms](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/lindwyrm-ghloe.md)*, called Bloodthirst and Eater of Men by the kobolds, lounge here feasting on a pile of livestock next to the altar. Eater of Men has a longsword of Valikan make stuck in his scales, behind his left claw. This is the sword Ingrind Settur seeks. The lindwyrms are happy to feast on the adventurers, yet another meal delivered directly to them.

#### Altar

The kobolds have piled many years' worth of stolen armor, weapons, trade goods, coins, and other knickknacks on a large flat stone. Several lit candles decorate the altar cause light to scatter off the treasure for 30-feet. Most of the treasure is not especially valuable, but 9,000 gp worth of coins and goods can be recovered. In addition, there is a [potion of flying](Mechanics/items/potion-of-flying.md), a [staff of healing](Mechanics/items/staff-of-healing.md) that is cursed to give the owner an unhealthy obsession with blood, and a dented brass clock that only counts backwards and tolls ominously at noon.

#### Bones

Bones of all types litter the floor, many of them centuries old, to a depth of three feet, making it difficult to move through the room. Treat the entire room as "difficult terrain" for any creature smaller than Large size.

## Conclusion

If the lindwyrms and the Lickscales are defeated, a great reoccurring evil is preventedâ€”though the legends of the beasts beneath the Thundering Hills are likely to remain for many generations. Oddly though, the rumbling doesn't stop. What horrors might bubble up from the crevasse that the presence of the lindwyrms had kept in check?

If the Tolfersons are rescued, they have little to reward the party with because of the recent damage to their farm. But after a season, they get back on their feet and start sending goat cheese, dried fruits, and mead. A break in their regular deliveries might mean the family is in trouble once again.

If Ingrind Settur's father's sword is recovered, she swears a blood oath to the characters to serve the heroes that avenged her father, though she cannot yet lift his sword. There is a dark anger in her eye, that if left unchecked, might blossom into sinister corruption. If the characters leave her on her own, the oath weighs heavily upon the girl, and she becomes a murderer killing those she believes to be the characters' enemies or detractors. As bodies accumulate everywhere the characters go, rumors begin to circulate that the party is cursed, or possibly evil.
