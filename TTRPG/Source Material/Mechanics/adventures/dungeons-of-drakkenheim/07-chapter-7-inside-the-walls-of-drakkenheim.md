# Chapter 7: Inside the Walls of Drakkenheim
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 112* 

The impressive city walls encircle Drakkenheim both north and south of the Drann River. Although a section of city walls was destroyed by the meteor, the crater left behind is widely considered impassable due to the extreme contamination present. The walls are otherwise intact, impeding access to the Inner City for adventurers and faction agents alike except via five gatehouses.

Many baroque architectural flairs decorate the walls. The battlements feature leering demonic faces, claw-like spikes, draconic carvings, and dutiful winged gargoyles that hold up machicolations. Yet these grotesque statues are no mere ornamentation. When Drakkenheim was a living city, these magical guardians could spring to life under the monarch's will. Now, they serve the twisted whims of the Haze in mockery of their final order to safeguard the city, and viciously attack any who dare trespass over the walls!

## Overview

Characters should reach at least 5th or 6th level before they attempt getting over the city walls. Even still, constantly battling animated guardians each time they travel into the Inner City will prove extremely draining on the character's resources, so they'll want to secure passage through one of the five city gates to access the city centre long-term. However, the gates are occupied by faction agents and monsters alike:

- Champion's Gate is nominally controlled by the Followers of the Falling Fire.  
- College Gate is now the site of a terrible dimensional rift.  
- King's Gate has been occupied by the Troll King.  
- Shepherd's Gate is defended by the Hooded Lanterns.  
- Temple Gate has become a makeshift stronghold for a massive garmyr warband.  

It's up to the player characters to clear out one of these locations, make a deal with their faction occupants, or invent another solution. Rival adventurers are quick to point out that using the sewers to sneak into the city isn't a smart alternative, as far more dangerous monsters lurk there.

### Adventure Hooks

#### Over the Top

The characters should learn about the hazards of the city walls through rumours or their own experiences, and search for solutions by their own initiative. The city walls can be introduced as a complication for any other adventure hook for the Inner City locations, as faction lieutenants and leaders note that any mission to the city centre will be much easier if the characters have a reliable way in and out.

#### The Battle of Temple Gate

At a key moment in the campaign, the Knights of the Silver Order will mount a major offensive to seize Temple Gate from the garmyr occupying it. They'll invite collaboration from the player characters as well as other factions in this joint effort.

### Encounters

Characters who do try to pass the walls may trigger one of the following encounters:

#### Wall Gargoyles

7 (`2d6`) [Wall Gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) animate and attack characters who dare attempt any of the following:

- Climbing more than halfway up the walls or towers  
- Flying within one hundred fifty feet of the city walls horizontally, or over them at any height  
- Lingering on the walls or towers for more than ten minutes  

The gargoyles attack directly, viciously, and without remorse. If they reduce their quarry to 0 hit points, they spend their next turn tearing apart the creature's body before moving on to another target. The gargoyles pursue their quarry into the city to any distance until they or their quarry are destroyed, but give up pursuing characters more than three hundred feet *outside* the city walls. However, Wall Gargoyles do not attack characters attuned to a *Seal of Drakkenheim* (see Appendix D).

#### Tower Dragons

Astute characters will note that there is no barrier spanning the section of the city where the walls meet the Drann River. This section of the city is not undefended, however. Instead of gargoyles, two [Tower Dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) perched upon the bastion towers flanking the river attack anyone crossing into the city via the river. They employ similar tactics to the Wall Gargoyles as described above.

### Area Details

Described first are the general features common to the walls, towers, and gates, followed by specific details on the inhabitants of each gate:

#### Walls

##### Walls

The stone masonry walls are forty feet high and ten feet thick with a machicolated battlement facing outward. Murder holes and overhanging artillery posts feature throughout, and areas of the wall near gates have wooden hoardings or shingled rooftops for additional defenses.

##### Towers

Sixty-foot-tall towers thirty feet in diameter are spaced throughout the wall. Some are topped with battlements, others have spired rooftops. Each tower is decorated with a majestic bronze dragon. The largest of these towers are built where the walls meet the Drann River.

#### Gatehouses

There are five barbican-style gatehouses that lead into the city proper. Each is composed of two squat bastion towers sixty feet tall and forty feet in diameter. The towers flank a fifteen-foot-wide double portcullis gate. While the gatehouses themselves have largely similar construction, their current occupants vary.

Each gatehouse has four levels, each approximately fifteen feet high. Outer walls are four to five feet thick. The interior floors are wooden, but the central spiral stair is stone. The arrow slit windows are only a few inches wide, and they provide three-quarters cover from those outside and below (+5 AC). Regular oaken doors are bound with wrought-iron and feature heavy locks and crossbars.

![Map 6.01: The Gate Houses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/077-map-6.01-gate-houses.webp#center)

##### Gate Passage

The gate tunnel is approximately fifteen feet wide, twenty five feet tall, and twenty five feet long. At each end are a wrought-iron portcullis and massive wooden doors bound with steel. The doors can be held shut via a massive bar that slides into place like a lever.

##### Tower Stairs

At the core of each tower is a stone spiral staircase. The staircase is five feet wide and has landings on each level.

##### Ground Level

The gatehouse can be entered from a barred doorway at a landing atop a ten foot high sloping stairway on one of the bastion towers. The base level of the left tower is not accessible from the outside. These chambers are typically used as sleeping quarters or a gaol.

##### Winch Level

It takes a team of operators to raise or lower the gate, requiring four successful DC 12 Strength checks, but the winch can be released to cause the gate to slam shut immediately.

##### Battlement Level

Accessed via doors. A creature taking a firing position behind the battlements has three-quarters cover from attackers below the walls (+5 AC).

##### Tower Battlements

Accessed via hatches. Ballista, catapults, or cannons were often deployed here.

#### Champion's Gate

This gate was struck by raining debris from the meteor and has mostly collapsed. One of the towers has toppled over into several buildings below. The gate itself is splintered and shattered. The entire passage is strewn with large rocks, chunks of worked stone, splintered wood and other scraps, debris, and refuse. There is a thin walkway cleared through the rubble and one of the towers has been cleared up to the entrance. Just inside the gate are a few tents gathered around a small makeshift campsite. The camp is huddled near the one available entrance into the gate tower. Twenty or so pilgrims of the Falling Fire can be found here resting and recuperating before going further on their journey. They occupy the small camp and some use the tower for discussions, meetings, or for the wounded who need support and healing. The gate is watched over by a Falling Fire [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) named Berman Weber.

- The gate is almost entirely collapsed after the meteor strike, and passing through is "difficult terrain".  
- The area around this gate is heavily contaminated and covered by the Deep Haze. Characters passing through the gate must succeed on a DC 15 constitution saving throw or suffer 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination.  
- All the followers of the Falling Fire based here have taken the sacrament and are immune to the Haze.  
- When new followers pass through on their pilgrimage they are offered quick support and healing and sent on their way to the craters edge.  
- The first time that the characters pass through this gate, [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) is here. She foresaw their coming and talks to them about joining her. On any given occasion afterwards there is a fifty percent chance that Lucretia herself is here to greet the new followers who have come to take the sacrament and knowingly awaiting the characters to implore them to join the Falling Fire.  
- If the Falling Fire become enemies of the characters, Lucretia Mathias is no longer here.  
- The gate is guarded by 5 [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) and 2 **zealots** who protect the flock. The rest of the Falling Fire members camping here are [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md). If the Falling Fire are enemies, there are twice as many of the above troops, and Lucretia Mathias summons two [devas](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) who perch on either tower and guard the gate.  
- Occasionally [Nathaniel Flint](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) can be found here escorting a group of `6d6` [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md).  

#### Interactions

The Falling Fire are welcoming but wary of wanderers who enter their camp. The fanatics and zealots question anyone approaching about their business. If they seem to have good intentions, or are just passing through, they ask if any would like to speak to Berman Weber, and offer them seats by the fire to rest for "the long road ahead".

- Around the campfire everyone shares stories of their call to the Falling Fire, they speak highly of Lucretia Mathias and the coming age of heroes. Many seem excited for their pilgrimage and openly discuss and debate the Falling Fire with the characters.  
- Berman Weber is willing to speak to characters and implores them to follow Lucretia Mathias. He discusses fate and the chance of their meeting, and uses that to push the player characters to take the sacrament. He believes and is very open in expressing that the age of heroes is coming, and no doubt that the characters are indeed, destined to come with them. If the characters refuse Berman expresses that this is fine, and he will see them again when the time is right.  
- If any hostility breaks out, Berman and the guards attempt to defend their flock. The cultists will defend themselves as well but they flee if the battle seems to not be going in their favour. If the Falling Fire abandons the gate, they send more people to secure it again `1d4` days later.  

#### College Gate

College Gate lays wide open. The streets before it are littered with ruins mostly burned to ash. Nothing but the foundations of buildings can be found here. The gate itself is covered in strange shimmering spiderwebs. They cover the entire gate, giving it the look of a broken pane of glass with webbed cracks weaving throughout it. Approaching the gate reveals a strange anomaly. Through the webs one can catch glimpses of alternate timelines and realities - one might see people walking the streets beyond, or the bustle of a living city; others see horrible demonic things enslaving humans; still others see a lush overgrown Drakkenheim covered in fungus and plant life, while other glimpses see a frozen or burning wasteland. Through each of the frames of the shattered glass one can see all conceivable futures and pasts for the city.

To look upon it is both mesmerizing and madness-inducing, as the fractured realities begin to warp one's mind.

- Any creature who looks upon the gate from within sixty feet of it must succeed on a DC15 Intelligence saving throw or take `2d12` psychic damage, are [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), and suffer an immediate Drakkenheim Madness. They remain [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until someone snaps them out of it, or they take damage.  
- Touching the webs causes 7 (`2d6`) [phase spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/phase-spider.md) to emerge, hungry to consume any creatures caught in their shifting realities. They will attack characters who are going mad first.  
- Burning away the webs removes them entirely, but they will reappear in `1d6` hours.  

#### King's Gate

This gate is occupied by a dozen [trolls](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/troll.md). Three trolls wait outside the gate to collect the toll. Two stay inside to work the winch, and two stand atop each tower to use the ballista. Three more wander the walls and surrounding area. The Troll King and his loyal captain are inside the left tower on the second level where they hold court over this new kingdom the Troll King has claimed.

- The Troll King, Zaffod, a huge [troll](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/troll.md) with two heads and three arms, sits in his makeshift throne room on the second level of the north tower. One of his heads goes by "Zaf" the other goes by "Fod," and they are constantly arguing over who gets to wear the crown. He has a hard time fitting through the doors so he rarely leaves the room. He has a large belly that hangs over his knees, and wears a necklace of human skulls. Those who do not pay the toll, or are otherwise problematic for the trolls, are brought before the king where he decides their fate. Their fate is almost always to be "boiled in a large pot and fed to the troops."  
- Zaffod wears a circlet crown that is a [headband of intellect](Mechanics/items/headband-of-intellect.md).  
- The Trolls of the gate are somewhat intellectual and although gruff, still present themselves as a jovial and agreeable group.  
- The three trolls at the gate demand a Troll Toll from anyone who hopes to enter Drakkenheim. It's reasonable—it will only cost you an arm and a leg! The trolls first bargain that others may pass as long as they give up one of them to be eaten. They beg for whoever is the biggest and meatiest of the group. They can be bargained with and are relatively easily persuaded, however they are indignant if offered livestock or animals, they respond "You are what you eat! Do you think us animals? We are civilized folk and so only dine on civilized folk!"  
- If characters are reduced to 0 hit points they are knocked [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) by the trolls, brought before the king tied up and bound, and presented as a feast.  
- They have a makeshift prison on the lowest level of the gatehouse where they keep prisoners that are next up to be cooked and eaten. They take the characters one at a time to a massive cauldron they keep over a burning fire and prepare to cook and eat them.  
- The trolls occupying the gate must squeeze to use the stairs and doors, so they rarely use the interior spaces except to sleep.  

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe

> The easiest way into the city might be going over the walls. What's the worst that could happen?

#### Shepherd's Gate

The Hooded Lanterns control Shepherd's Gate. A dozen [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) and thirty [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are stationed here at all times. During the day, this force is commanded by Gate-Captain Jacob Slovak, and by Gate-Captain Raine Highlash at night (both human [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md)).

The entire force is rotated on twelve hour shifts so the defenders may rest outside the Haze. The guard force changes over each day at 8 AM and 8 PM. They maintain a nearby shed where they keep six fresh [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md). This is a brutal assignment, so reserve forces are often called up to take a shift to give the main guards extra time off to recover.

- **Siege Defenses.** The rangers have installed additional defenses all around the gatehouse. Wooden hoardings are built over the walls and tower battlements, and they've dug ditches lined with wooden stakes below the walls. Finally, a wooden barricade supported by sandbags has been erected on the road. Several ballistas are deployed atop each tower.  

#### Interactions

They have runners and several horses at the ready, as well as flare guns and signal horns.

- They offer to escort adventurers to the City Guard Barracks, which is only a few hundred feet away in the Midden.  
- There is a ten percent chance that [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) can be found here when the characters are passing through.  
- The Hooded Lanterns double the amount of troops encountered here if they've made enemies with the player characters or another faction.  

#### Temple Gate

Occupied by garmyr who have built a shanty-town encampment around the gate. Nearly a hundred garmyr dwell here at any given time, and the warbands are like a hornet's nest.

- 70 (`20d6`) [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) dwell here with 14 (`4d6`) [worgs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md)  
- 10 (`3d6`) garmyr [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) and 5 (`2d4`) [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md)  

### Battle of Temple Gate

At a pivotal moment in the campaign, the Silver Order announces their plans to take Temple Gate, forcing the garmyr back into the city and securing a position for their force to gain a foothold in the city. Regardless of the characters' allegiances, this battle proves to be a major event for all factions, and is the first act in a series of events that lead to a confrontation at the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.

The Battle of Temple Gate might occur after the player characters have achieved the following:

- Met the faction leaders and started forming alliances with one or more of them  
- Explored the Cosmological Clocktower and recovered one of the *Seal of Drakkenheim* there, plus visited at least two other locations in the Inner City  

Following these developments, Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal reasons it's time to make a push for Temple Gate. Depending on who the characters are most closely allied with, this could result in many different outcomes. Whatever faction the characters are closest with will inform them as described below.

#### Silver Order

If the player characters are allied with the Silver Order, Theadore Marshal summons the characters to Camp Dawn to devise a battle plan together. He proposes the player characters spearhead an assault to open the gates for the cavalry, while the Silver Order forces hold off any garmyr reinforcements. The Silver Order aims to take the gate, but want to avoid damaging or destroying it in the process so it can be used as a forward base. However, he's worried about sabotage from the other factions, and asks the characters to act as envoys to either secure aid from the Hooded Lanterns, or check in on the other factions to ensure they won't interfere.

#### Hooded Lanterns

The Hooded Lanterns have tried on multiple occasions to push back the garmyr, but the Lord of the Feast has proven a formidable foe. Lord Commander Elias Drexel is open to working with the Silver Order on a joint operation, and proposes a pincer strike with the Hooded Lanterns working inside the city, and the Silver Order engaging in a frontal assault. However, the Lord Commander is concerned about a foreign military force occupying ground in Drakkenheim, and wants assurance from the Silver Order that they aren't here for conquest.

#### Queen's Men

The garmyr are a problem for the Queen's Men, too, and have caused more than enough injuries and death amongst her gangs. While she has ulterior motives of her own, the Queen of Thieves wants to see the Silver Order accomplish their goals. She believes that holding Temple Gate will likely stretch the Silver Order to their limit once they raise the ire of the Lord of the Feast, and hopes that a victory in this battle will lead to the embarrassing defeat of the Silver Order from attrition.

#### Amethyst Academy

Eldrick Runeweaver is curious but concerned about the Silver Order's plans, and wants to ascertain their goals. He knows the Silver Order are keen to destroy delerium, which is a problem for the Academy. However, he's doubtful destroying all the delerium in the city is even possible, so he wants to know if the Silver Order has an ace-in-the-hole. Taking Temple Gate and destroying the monsters there is in the best interest of everyone, but the Academy doesn't want the Silver Order getting too comfortable with their place in the city.

#### Followers of the Falling Fire

Lucretia Mathias is concerned about the Silver Order's plan, and doesn't want them to gain a footing so close to her flock. She foresees the Silver Order will use this momentum to force a war on the Falling Fire and attempt to drive them from the city as if they were no better than the garmyr. Lucretia wants to find a way to prevent the Silver Order from taking the gate, and instead have the characters lure the Lord of The Feast out of the cathedral and into open war with the Silver Order. This may give them time to claim the cathedral for themselves while the two forces whittle each other down.

#### War At The Gate

The characters can participate in the battle of Temple Gate in any way they choose, regardless of their alliances. The Silver Order offers griffon riders, cavalry, and a band of knights to aid in any way. The players can be creative with how they take on Temple Gate. Regardless, it will be a difficult encounter.

If the player characters have made enemies of the Silver Order at this point, there are also options to convince any of the other factions to help ensure a failure at the battle. There are many options for crafty players to swing the battle the way they want it to go.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/079-06-003.crossbow.webp#center)

The force at the gate consists of 100 [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and their [chimera](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md). They have sentries on the walls armed with crossbows, and two ballistas atop each tower always manned by several garmyr. They keep the portcullis on the gate closed and keep all doors and rooms well-guarded. Even with the battle raging, characters will have to fight their way through the garmyr to open the portcullis and ensure the Silver Order's forces can take the gate.

- The Silver Order tasks the players with getting the gate open for them.  
- They offer to fly them in on [griffons](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md), or put them on horses for the first charge to try and get them as close to the gate as possible.  
- There are two winches inside the towers that need to be opened for the gate to be usable. The players must open both.  
- Once the gate is open, the Silver Order are able to drive out the garmyr in `1d6` rounds as their troops flood the gatehouses and clear out any monsters who do not flee.  

> [!note] Developments
> 
> After the events at Temple Gate, there are several directions the factions might push to go.
> 
> **If The Silver Order Succeeds.** If the gate is taken, the Silver Order are able to hold it, but can not push any further without the aid of the characters. They use the gate as a forward command post and their presence draws the eyes of the other factions towards their goals and objectives. The next move for the Silver Order is to try to convince the characters to help them defeat the Lord of the Feast and take the cathedral. Without the characters' help this task is impossible.
> 
> Lucretia Mathias needs to make it to the cathedral before the Silver Order does, and pushes the matter on the characters if they are allies. Meanwhile the Queen of Thieves wants the characters to take the cathedral and obtain many items that she would like for herself. Depending on the relationship between the factions at this point, it is up to the characters to convince the Hooded Lanterns or Amethyst Academy if continuing to help the Silver Order is of any value to them.
> 
> **If The Silver Order Fails.** Perhaps the events did not go well, or perhaps the player characters found themselves opposed to the Silver Order's goals. If the Silver Order fails to take the gate, the Lord of the Feast claims the victory, putting many Silver Order knights on a gruesome display hanging over the city gate. The Silver Order maintain their position in Camp Dawn, but unless aided by the characters, fail to gain a footing in the city. If no help is offered, the Silver Order call for reinforcements from Elyria to help them take the city by force and begin to plan another attack that will take months to come to fruition.
> 
> - If the characters have entered the Inner City to explore it, the Silver Order will announce their plans to take Temple Gate.  
> - If the player characters do not intervene, whether or not the Silver Order takes Temple Gate is up to you - we recommend whatever option creates the greatest complication for the Characters.  
> - Unless the player characters intervene, the Hooded Lanterns and the Silver Order join forces to take Temple Gate, however lacking the collaboration of the characters, this alliance disintegrates soon after, leaving the Silver Order unable to push further although they maintain control of the gate.  
> - If the characters have not interacted much with either the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, but are already exploring the Inner City, choose either the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order and have them ask the characters if they will help them form an alliance for the taking of the gate. Whether or not this works is up for the characters to decide.

## Cosmological Clocktower

The Cosmological Clocktower is built on the Market Square Plaza at the heart of Drakkenheim. Created at the behest of an eccentric monarch, this mechanical wonder mysteriously stopped one hundred eleven years ago, and its function as a public belltower was replaced by Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral. Many early expedition teams into the ruins used the clocktower as a landmark and bivouac; remarkably the tower attic lies just above the Haze. Yet the highest spires of Drakkenheim are no safer than the streets below, especially since a bloodthirsty flock of harpies took to roost in the tower.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/080-06-004.cosmological-clocktower.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, the characters assault the Cosmological Clocktower to wrest control of the strategic outpost. Not only will they be rewarded for their efforts with their own base of operations in the city, they may also find a *Seal of Drakkenheim* here.

#### Adventure Hook

##### Timely Rest

A long-standing rumour holds that the Cosmological Clocktower is one of the few "safe" places to rest within Drakkenheim. These rumours are indeed true: the tower attic juts out just above the Haze, thus the area is a safe place for characters to take a long rest. Every faction leader knows the value of the clocktower as a base of operations within the city. Once the characters begin developing a positive and collaborative relationship with any faction leader, they'll suggest the characters claim it from the vicious harpies who dwell there.

### Interactions

It's unknown if these harpies were the result of strange mutations wrought upon birds or humans, perhaps both are true. Nevertheless these capricious, cruel, and territorial monsters have little interest in bargaining or negotiations. Nearly 40 [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) live in the tower, though at any given time, half are out hunting. They are led by the [Crimson Countess](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crimson-countess-dodk.md), a red-plumed harpy matriarch:

- **Personality Trait.** I screech blood-curdling war cries and perform aerial stunts as intimidation.  
- **Ideal.** Any who walk the earth are prey for those who soar the sky.  
- **Bond.** I collect trophies from my kills to remind my flock who is the mightiest.  
- **Flaw.** I am aggressively territorial, envious of my rivals, and covetous of my trinkets.  

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe

> Birds constantly circle this tower, but recently the birds seem much, much bigger.

### Area Details

![Map 6.02: Cosmological Clocktower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/081-map-6.02-cosmological-clocktower.webp#center)

#### Market Square Plaza

The market square is the largest open courtyard in the city.

The square consists of two plazas, separated by a cluster of banks, vaults, guildhalls, and businesses. The ruins and remains of high town houses with storefronts surround the square. Scattered across the plaza are the remains of Drakkenheim's central open air market: rows of stalls, canvas tents, pavilions, baskets, crates, wagons, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, and bones creating a tattered display of the chaos of that day left behind. The distant sounds of a lullaby, chimes, and faraway bells fills the air.

Market Square Plaza bears the scars of many battles: makeshift barricades, scorch marks, broken weapons, armour scraps, and a few scattered corpses. Many rats scurry about, crows pick over the remains, and a thin, silvery-purple mist hangs in the air. Looking up, you can see the Cosmological Clocktower piercing through the fog.

- Lingering in the market square is dangerous. Characters who do not take steps to conceal their passage are noticed and attacked by 10 (`3d6`) [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) who fly out from the tower.  

- **Drakkenheim Guildhall.** This building is not far from the clocktower. Formerly the administrative hub for trade and industry in Drakkenheim, this larger open hall is a gathering place for the city guild leaders and merchants, and contains offices, vaults, and a large auditorium that served as council chambers for the guild. However, the once-great vaulted roof has entirely collapsed, leaving mostly only the outer shell of the great building behind. Perhaps several impressive vaults lay buried under heaps of wreckage and rubble, but it would take significant effort to excavate the damage.  

#### Clocktower Facade

At the centre of the square is the clocktower. The three-hundred-foot tall square tower is about fifty feet wide at the base, with rounded turret corners and walls supported by great buttresses. The front facade is a mechanical wonder. Near the top of the tower is a massive thirty-foot-wide clock face made from glass, the numerals and hands filigreed with silver, brass, and gold. Above are several crenellated balconies, and the roof is a steep spire topped with a wrought-iron weathervane.

Bordering the central clock is an embossed metal and glass dial that depicts the transit of the sun and the phases of the moon through each month. From this dial, one can read not only the time but the date, as it shows a stylized interpretation of the seasons and constellations. Extending down the clock face is a further system of circular glass plates, gears, and wheels that illustrate in mechanical precision the grand cosmic dance of the planets and stars as they hurtle through the astral void. Multicoloured glass lenses superimposed over the planet depict the metaphysical orbit of the afterworlds and side-realms and their relation to the mortal world. The rest of the tower is decorated with elegant carved statues depicting angels, saints, demons, devils, elementals, and the various creatures of the worlds beyond. On some levels are rows of gothic windows with trefoil arches filled with stained-glass mosaics.

The entire mechanism is frozen, stuck on the 11th day of the 11th month, 111 years ago, at 11:11 AM, the phases of the planes resting between the Elemental Chaos and Dreamland.

On the ground level, a set of stone stairs leads to the copper double doors.

#### Clocktower Interior

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tower interior is a dramatic contrast to the elegant outer facade. The walls are exposed brick, and a rickety wooden staircase ascends the interior supported by a wrought-iron scaffold. The decorative exterior windows allow some light to pass into the tower; many along the way are shattered and broken. The stone floor is covered in dust, bone, debris, and avian feces. Gears connected by chains, stacks of heavy dangling counterweights on pulleys, and pendulum mechanisms hang down the northern wall. High above can be seen the bells.
^3a3

##### Stairs

These creaking wooden stairs snake along the inner walls of the tower for two hundred feet, connecting the ground floor to the belfry gantries above. Each individual flight rises sharply twenty feet to a small corner landing and sports a thin metal railing.

- The harpies make their nests in the landings along the staircase. They enter and exit the tower through the broken windows and never use the front doors. There may be as many as 10 (`3d6`) [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) roosting throughout the stairs at any time.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/082-06-005.egg.webp#center)

##### Belfry

The staircase ends at a wooden gantry clinging to the outer walls of the tower. This narrow walkway overlooks thirteen massive bronze bells hung in the middle of the tower belfry. Each ranges from three to five feet wide and weighs several tonnes. The bells are yoked to steel girders and do not swing. Instead, the bells are struck by exterior hammers fitted to each and controlled by the machinery above. As each bell sounds in a distinct tone, this mechanical system could play many unique bellsongs when the clock tower still functioned.

- It's a two-hundred-foot drop to the floor below. A spiral staircase in the northwestern parapet ascents twenty feet to the Clockworks above.  
- `1d4` [manticores](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md), consorts to the [Crimson Countess](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crimson-countess-dodk.md), make nests in niches in the belfry.  

#### Clockworks

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A complex mechanism of gears, counterweights, and clockwork dominates this chamber. Several thin windows overlook the surrounding cityscape. The floor features several steel grates and wooden hatches that allow access to the machinery and bells below. A strange granite obelisk is set in place of the main clock pendulum; the core of the "ticking" mechanism that controls the clock. Three empty sockets lined with delicate copper tracery are cut into the stone. A fine elven script inlaid with thin lines of silver and gold are etched into the surrounding surface. Several pennies are precisely balanced atop it. A system of pulleys, winches, and levers connects it to the rest of the clockwork.
> 
> A set of shelves here contain several notched metal discs, each kept in a paper folder bearing the title of a song. When the clock tower functioned, these discs could be loaded into the receptacle to determine which song was played by the bells.
> 
> Several small and curious mechanical automatons wander listlessly around this chamber, examining and tinkering with the mechanical components. They are shaped like platonic polyhedrons with spindly mechanical limbs, disturbingly realistic glass eyes, and a mechanical mouthpiece.
^3a7

- There are `1d6` automatons here. If their game statistics are required, use those for [animated armor](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md), except their size is small. If interacted with, they seem addled and confused. When they speak, they repeatedly utter "zero" and "one" in long-winded combinations. The remains of a larger automaton are splayed about the chamber, it appears like it exploded from the inside.  
- The elven runes describe in precise and exacting detail several mathematical calculations involving the passage of time, the planets, the seasons, and the planes.  
- The stone itself is quite lightweight; a character proficient in [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or engineering-related fields could deduce that such a stone would normally not be sufficient to accurately drive such an intricate clock mechanism.  
- Examining the stone further with [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) or [identify](Mechanics/spells/identify.md) spells determines it is a magic item. It is attuned to time and space itself, and could vary its density and composition to act as the perfect pendulum. However, it is missing an appropriate power source.  

The harpies rarely come to this level. They don't use the stairs, and fly directly into the Rookery or through the broken windows in the Bell Tower.

#### Rookery

> [!readaloud]

> A disgusting amalgamation of bird nest and boudoir. Macabre decorations of bone, skulls, and body parts are presented alongside scavenged finery from the ruins: pillows, sheets, veils, and the like. All are filthy, torn, and ruined.

It can be found in her nest alongside the following note:

The characters would do well to make a good alliance to help them keep this holding secure, as if left abandoned other monsters and faction forces are quick to seize the opportunity to control this valuable strategic location. Nevertheless, once the characters have taken adequate steps to firmly defend their new holding, it is a critical base of operations for their future explorations.

## The Crater

> [!quote] A quote from Lieutenant Petra Lang  
> 
> No one has ever been there and returned. We don't really know what we're up against, do we?

The meteor crashed upon the South Ward of Drakkenheim. Once the industrial hub of the city, little remains here save blasted ruins and a massive mist-filled crater. The edge of the crater is a long-sought destination for prospectors and pilgrims alike for the vast deposits of delerium found there. Few have ventured deeper within, however. Shrouded deep within the most dangerous and contaminated region in all of Drakkenheim, madness and ruin fester in the pulsing Delerium Heart.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/084-06-007.the-crater.webp#center)

### Overview

Depending on their objectives, player characters planning an expedition to the crater might only aim to reach the Crater's Edge, or they might push onwards through the Crater Basin to the centre of the crater. Either way, they'll need potent tools to protect themselves against contamination.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Survey the Impact Site

(Amethyst Academy, Silver Order, or Hooded Lanterns). If the characters discover an extraordinarily effective defense against contamination, such as the [neutralizing field](Mechanics/spells/neutralizing-field-dodk.md) spell or [hazewalker plate](Mechanics/items/hazewalker-plate-dodk.md), a faction leader may suggest using these means to launch a mission to the crater. The goal is simple: find out what's in there. Faction leaders can offer the following warnings:

- Mages have tried to study the crater using [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spells and divination magic, but were driven mad in the process. Those who tried teleporting within were never seen again.  
- Eldritch lightning surrounds the air above the crater, and creatures struck by it are disintegrated.  
- Lucretia Mathias made the journey herself, but she does not speak of what she discovered there. She cryptically remarks that it cannot be explained or understood, and must be seen.  

##### Pilgrimage of Falling Fire

(Falling Fire) Characters who demonstrate their faith in the teachings of Lucretia Mathias are invited to take the pilgrimage to the Crater's Edge. There, each must find a delerium fragment in the shape of their soul, and bring it to the Chapel of Saint Gresha, where the pilgrim may partake in the Sacrament of Falling Fire.

### Interactions

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Set a fire in your belly, warm your heart, and shield yourself in light for the road ahead."
^3b7

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md), [Nathaniel Flint](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md), and other Followers of the Falling Fire often lead pilgrimages of [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) and [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) to the Crater's Edge, and can frequently be encountered in this region. Any random encounters in this region may be replaced with a Falling Fire strike team, or a pilgrimage of 10 (`3d6`) [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) led by a [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md).

#### Pilgrimage of Falling Fire

Only characters who are devout and sincere in their commitment to the Followers of the Falling Fire are invited to complete a pilgrimage to the Crater's Edge, where they will participate in a ritual known as the *Sacrament of Falling Fire* at the Chapel of Saint Gresha. Characters can participate on their own or as part of another group of Falling Fire pilgrims. While outsiders rarely witness the rite itself, the Followers of the Falling Fire will tolerate a respectful observer in the hopes that seeing the ritual might assuage any remaining doubt in their heart.

#### A Fragment in the Shape of a Soul

When they arrive at the Crater's Edge, pilgrims must individually search for a delerium fragment that reflects an inner aspect of their own heart. Each attempt takes one hour, after which the character makes an ability check using their highest ability score. They find a suitable fragment on a check result of 20 or higher, and should appropriately describe and roleplay how this check guides them towards a delerium fragment. Most normal pilgrims must visit the crater several times before they successfully find such a fragment.

#### Completing the Pilgrimage

Once a pilgrim finds a fragment, they must bring it to the Chapel of Saint Gresha (see below) where they take the [Sacrament of the Falling Fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md).

### Area Details

The entire South Ward is suffused in the Deep Haze (see chapter 5).

#### South Ward Ruins

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Few structures are standing in the South Ward of Drakkenheim. Little remains save demolished foundations, massive chunks of blasted rock, and piles of rubble and debris. The thick fog of the Deep Haze blankets the wasteland. The direction of the devastation is unmistakable, however. Stone, brick, and timbers on any walls or pillars facing the crater itself appear melted rather than burned, and in some cases, pieces of rock or wood have partially turned into glass. Occasionally, you see the unmistakable glimmer of delerium fused into the ground or walls of a tumbledown building. The air here is cold, the mists billow about in hypnotic swirling patterns. A peculiar smell fills the air, it's acrid and pungent as if some strange material were burning nearby. Once in a while you hear the sound of crumbling rock or the creaking collapse of a distant building.
^3bd

- Check for random encounters as normal as characters travel through this region.  

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe  
> 
> I've had some horrible nightmares in my day. This place was unfathomably worse.

#### Crater's Edge

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You stand upon the crater's edge. Here, the blasted ruins of the city end upon a rocky precipice that descends into a mist-filled basin. A plume of thick swirling fog rises from the centre of the crater. Crackling eldritch lighting arcs through the air into the clouds above, and a bitterly cold wind howls about. Jutting out from the rocky chasm are countless sparkling delerium fragments.
^3bf

- The cliff edge descends one hundred fifty feet to the crater basin floor on a sharp slope.  
- It's impossible to see the crater basin floor due to the thick mists.  
- DC 15 [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana). A character who studies the fog and makes a check realizes the Haze here is significantly thicker and likely far more contaminated than normal. You can reveal to such characters that Constitution saving throws against contamination will likely be needed for every 10 minutes within the Haze inside the crater basin.  
- DC 15 [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature) or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival). Examining the swirling mist at the centre notes the powerful lighting arcing through the fog. You can reveal to characters the details of the *eldritch lightning* in the Crater Basin (see below).  

#### Scaling the Cliff

Three successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks are needed to carefully scale up or down the edge. Characters may use equipment or spells to aid their climb - spells such as [feather fall](Mechanics/spells/feather-fall.md) or [spider climb](Mechanics/spells/spider-climb.md) allow automatic success.

- A character takes 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed check as they tumble and slip down the sharp rock face.  
- A character who fails three checks before reaching three successes has a terrible fall. They take 17 (`5d6`) bludgeoning and 17 (`5d6`) piercing damage.  

Alternatively, characters can Search the Ruins (see chapter 5) to locate gentler slopes or a pathway where easier descent is possible.

If you'd like to add extra tension to this moment, consider having a lone [grotesque gargant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/grotesque-gargant-dodk.md) climb out of the crater and attack while characters are looking out over the basin, scaling the cliff, or searching for a way down!

#### Chapel of Saint Gresha

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Along the northwest side of the crater rests the Chapel of Saint Gresha. Nothing remains of the domed rooftop. Instead, the bricks composing the circular chapel float in the air, deconstructed in perfect geometric order. Perhaps if the magic holding them aloft were broken, they would collapse back into their proper place. Inside the chapel walls, a lighted stone brazier stands upon a tiered marble dais. The entropic flame burns in an unnatural purple-red hue, the coals within are delerium shards. The mosaic on the floor is cracked and broken. Several platforms may have once held statues, but little else remains save blasted rock.
^3c2

- [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) can be encountered here at dawn each day, when she performs the [Sacrament of the Falling Fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md) for up to 12 pilgrims. [Nathaniel Flint](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) is sometimes here leading a pilgrimage as well.  
- [Saint Gresha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/saint-gresha-dodk.md) (see below) performs the rite each day at dusk.  
- 12 neutral good [wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wight.md) guard the chapel. Each wears ancient half-plate armour. These are the sacred remains of former paladins interred in the chapel, and are not haze wights.  

#### Saint Gresha

Gresha is a neutral good [arcane wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/arcane-wraith-dodk.md). She was called back in spirit by Lucretia Mathias to tend her namesake chapel. Her Spellcasting trait is replaced with the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At will: [guidance](Mechanics/spells/guidance.md), [light](Mechanics/spells/light.md), [sacred flame](Mechanics/spells/sacred-flame.md), [thaumaturgy](Mechanics/spells/thaumaturgy.md)
> 
> 3/day each: [bless](Mechanics/spells/bless.md), [flame strike](Mechanics/spells/flame-strike.md), [guiding bolt](Mechanics/spells/guiding-bolt.md), [healing word](Mechanics/spells/healing-word.md), [prayer of healing](Mechanics/spells/prayer-of-healing.md), [spirit guardians](Mechanics/spells/spirit-guardians.md)
> 
> 1/day each: [divine word](Mechanics/spells/divine-word.md), [harm](Mechanics/spells/harm.md), [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md), [holy aura](Mechanics/spells/holy-aura.md), [sacrament of falling fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md)*
> 
> *new spell described in Appendix D
^3c4

If Saint Gresha is destroyed, Lucretia Mathias calls her spirit back again as soon as possible.

#### Crater Basin

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The crater basin is a forlorn and desolate place. The raw earth is a deep purple-brown colour. Black glass chips and rocky gravel crunch underfoot mixed with bits and pieces of unrecognizable masonry and flecks of delerium. Here and there you encounter peculiar vegetation: creeping moss that resembles exposed sinew or swelling tissue, with leaves like fleshy membranes and roots like spreading blood vessels. The strange plants cling to clusters of delerium and around pools of sludge.
^3c6

##### Deep Haze

Within the crater, the Deep Haze is exceptionally thick and nearly impenetrable: vision beyond 30 feet is totally obscured and blocks most of the light from the sky above, so areas within are dimly lit and "lightly obscured". At the end of every ten minutes spent within, characters must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination.

##### Eldritch Lightning

Sheets of flashing energy and crackling eldritch lightning erupt through the mist around the crater, which extends to the clouds above. Any airborne creature flying higher than sixty feet above the Crater Basin rolls `1d6` at the end of its turn: on a one, it is struck by the lightning and must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take `10d6` lightning damage and `10d6` force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it and everything it is wearing or carrying are reduced to black ashes and scattered into the wind. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) or a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell.

##### Twisted Space

A creature who teleports into or out of the Crater Basin is ripped apart by eldritch magic and takes damage as if they were struck by eldritch lightning (see above)

#### Finding the Delerium Heart

Characters seeking the Delerium Heart must Search the Ruins for one hour, as described in "Navigating Drakkenheim" in chapter 5. In addition to making [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) checks, characters may use [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana), [Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight), [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion), [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival) to help navigate the basin. Success requires a DC 20 check result, with any check result of 25 or higher granting an additional success. What the characters find each attempt is based on their number of successes:

| Number of Successes | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| 2 successes or fewer | Nothing |
| 3 successes | Massive delerium cluster |
| 4 or more successes | Delerium Heart |
^number-of-successes-result

Two or more failed check results triggers one of the random encounters below. As characters are exposed to a powerful version of the Deep Haze here, they will need some means to gain immunity to contamination, otherwise they'll have to make six Constitution saving throws each time they attempt searching the crater.

### Random Encounters in the Crater Basin

Check for random encounters as normal as characters explore the basin, using this table to generate encounters.

#### Massive Delerium Clusters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Unfathomably large delerium geode clusters protrude from the earth throughout the crater basin. Most grow as tall as a human, some as big as ogres or even larger. Viscous opalescent liquid perspires from the crystals, forming pools around it.
^3cd

- There are a [living haze](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/living-deep-haze-dodk.md), [animated delerium sludge](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/animated-delerium-sludge-dodk.md), [walking delerium cluster](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/walking-delerium-geode-dodk.md), and an [entropic flame](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/entropic-flame-dodk.md) lurking around the cluster and the pool.  
- The pools are two or three feet deep and anywhere from ten to forty feet in diameter.  
- Characters can find 1 delerium geode, `1d6` delerium crystals, and `2d6` delerium shards that are easy enough to extract. Harvesting the massive crystals in the field is impossible with portable equipment, however.  
- If damaged or struck these massive geodes release an arcane anomaly.  

#### Delerium Heart

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air is humid and filled with the overpowering smell of ozone here. Thrumming eldritch energy makes your hair stand on end, and a low humming sound painfully rings in your ears. Suddenly, the mists clear somewhat, revealing an unfathomably colossal delerium shard seventy feet high and thirty feet wide. Pieces of rock and meteoric iron cling to the sides; it glows brightly with blinding octarine light and visibly perspires globs of prismatic delerium sludge that forms a pool around it. The edges of the crystal intersect at incomprehensible angles, making its geometry shift despite its apparent stillness. It gives you a headache to look at it. Mounds of upturned earth, huge chunks of meteoric iron, and massive delerium geodes emerge like islands from the pond.
^3cf

- This is all that remains of the core of the meteor. The mere sight of its impossible geometry is enough to drive a creature mad. The first time a humanoid creature witnesses the Delerium Heart, it must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it is affected as if by a [feeblemind](Mechanics/spells/feeblemind.md) spell.  
- The delerium sludge pool is four feet deep (see Appendix D).  
- A creature who ends its turn within one hundred twenty feet of the Delerium Heart must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or suffer 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination. A creature who fails this saving throw by five or more instead takes 35 (`10d6`) necrotic damage and gains `1d4` levels of contamination.  
- Treasure. A *pristine delerium geode* is found here with 10 (`3d6`) delerium crystals. This extremely rare crystal formation is perfectly symmetrical, notably unique, and readily extracted by any character looking to collect delerium around the Heart.  
- Characters must find their way back from the Delerium Heart in the same manner they got here, by searching the ruins for the Crater's Edge.  
- A creature who approaches within ten feet of the Delerium Heart may examine it closely. It's hollow: suspended within a quicksilver fluid are embryonic fleshy masses connected with thin veins to translucent, pulsing heart-like organs. A creature who *touches* the Delerium Heart has a sudden vision:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The vision lasts only a moment, but feels like a thousand years. A falling star collides with an unfamiliar world. A prismatic mist slowly creeps from the impact. Massive sharp-edged crystals burst from the surface of the world, and the people there descend into chaos and madness. The corrupt sphere violently ruptures apart, sending a hail of comets through the cosmos until one looms over this world.
^3d0

#### Destroying the Delerium Heart

Characters can attempt to destroy the Delerium Heart:

- It has AC 25 and 500 hit points. It regains 50 hit points each round on initiative count 20 as long as it has at least one hit point remaining.  
- The Heart is immune to cold, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, and slashing damage, as well as bludgeoning damage from non-magical attacks. It is resistant to fire damage. It is vulnerable to thunder damage.  
- Once per round on initiative count 20, if the Delerium Heart took damage in the previous round, it unleashes an arcane anomaly. The resounding noise attracts nearby creatures each round, attracting creatures using the random encounter table above.  

When destroyed, the Delerium Heart explodes, dealing `10d6` necrotic damage, `10d6` radiant damage, `10d6` psychic damage, `10d6` piercing damage, and `10d6` thunder damage to all creatures within five hundred feet. This explosion causes the shard to fracture into thirteen massive geodes that are sent hurtling throughout the city, which each grow into a Delerium Heart within a year if they aren't destroyed. The embryonic mass within the Heart pours into the sludge, and quickly grows into a horrific abomination: a [Tarrasque](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md).

> This dire news only confirms what we already assumed to be true. Drakkenheim is no more.

Characters who return expecting the factions to be united by their report will be disappointed.

**.** **.** **Hooded Lanterns.** Elias Drexel is horrified by the characters' report, which is a despair-inducing confirmation that restoring Drakkenheim will never be a simple matter, and a realization that he will need the help of another faction to accomplish it. The Lord Commander isn't even sure he should reveal the characters' report to the rank-and-file soldiers at large. He's right. Mutiny in the ranks erupts at the news as the soldiers argue about the merits of working with the Silver Order, the Followers of the Falling Fire, or the Amethyst Academy. If the characters have made an enemy of any of these factions, a few loudly and defiantly proclaim the characters have doomed them all. Unless the characters and Elias Drexel can deliver another major victory soon, the unrest festers and the Hooded Lanterns disintegrate into fractious warbands.

**Amethyst Academy.** Eldrick Runeweaver is fascinated by the news of the Delerium Heart, and openly remarks that unfathomable arcane power could be harnessed from it (and thereby prevent whatever calamity affected the alien world from happening here). After several days, he returns to the characters and asks them if they might be prepared to mount another expedition to set up a magical arcane relay he's designed. If the characters didn't bring back the pristine delerium geode, he also asks them to obtain it.

**Falling Fire.** Once characters return from the crater's heart, Lucretia Mathias can explain the meaning of any visions they beheld. She then reveals the purpose of the Sacrament: by storing enough faithful souls in delerium, she believes the substance itself will become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame, transforming the scourge of the universe into its savior. The sanctified delerium will spread light through the cosmos. When asked about the fate of this world, Lucretia Mathias remarks that the Sacred Flame has always required mortals make sacrifices for the cause of righteousness. Whether or not her claims are true cannot be determined until the events are allowed to occur.

**Silver Order.** Theodore Marshal sees no further argument at this point: Drakkenheim must be burned to the ground. The fate of the world rests upon it. Doing so isn't going to be simple, and now the mission is clear: the Silver Order must resurrect Argonath to use his dragonfire to destroy the Delerium Heart.

**Queen's Men.** The Queen of Thieves can only react with laughter to this knowledge. The fact that such a horrific threat lies in the heart of the city is music to her ears. As long as it's there, no one will ever truly be able to control Drakkenheim - except her. The Queen of Thieves aims to weaponize this knowledge to sow doubt and discord in the other factions, especially the Hooded Lanterns. Whatever the characters saw in those visions isn't going to happen anytime soon, anyways.

## Kleinberg Estate

Deep in the noble district of Drakkenheim, just south of Castle Drakken, a walled off community known as the Kleinberg Estate stands. Amongst the ruins and debris, several of the large mansions have survived the devastation of Drakkenheim. One such estate has become lively with activity in recent years. Figures have been seen coming and going from it, which has spurred whispers and rumours within the taverns of Emberwood village. Conversations between forlorn adventurers and sickly survivors speak of a mage working out of the estate who has means to help those who are suffering with contamination. The validity of these claims is yet to be proven, and so those seeking help best be wary, as more often than not, people who have ventured deeper in search of a cure seldom return.

### Overview

There may be many reasons the player characters choose to uncover the Pale Man.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Search for a Cure

Characters seeking the means to reverse a monstrous transformation might seek out the Pale Man, as rumours abound of the secretive mage who can help with mutations and contamination.

##### The Academy Deal

The Academy might hire the party to find the Pale Man and uncover what secret spells and arcane concoctions he has created. River asks the players to retrieve his work and bring it back to them with any relevant information or samples. The Academy is willing to offer the Pale Man a deal for his cooperation, but fully expect him to decline. They do not care if the Pale Man lives, as long as his work is recovered.

##### The Witch Hunt

The Silver Order might hire the players to find and kill the Pale Man - they want his work burned, and any delerium in his possession destroyed.

### Interactions

The minions that work for the Pale Man are more social than normal dregs, and should be portrayed as having quirky, weird, and insane personalities. They direct characters to Raven, who handles all business deals. None of them know much about the Pale Man's research or experiments, and just express relief at the aid he has offered them.

#### Friedrich von Lichten, the Pale Man

Friedrich Von Lichten ambitiously explored the mutagenic effects of delerium after Drakkenheim's destruction, and was among the first to fully describe the effects of eldritch contamination upon the human body. He was ejected from the Amethyst Academy when it was discovered he was using apprentices as test subjects. So grave was his trespass, that the Academy notified the Silver Order of his existence, putting a death bounty on his head. Both The Silver Order and the Amethyst Academy have been searching for him since.

- **Personality Trait.** Witness my power, understand that I am the future. Some may call me a god, and I would not correct them.  
- **Ideal.** We must embrace the Haze, and allow contamination to change us, make us better.  
- **Bonds.** The Amethyst Academy lacks vision. I will show them the true power of delerium.  
- **Flaw.** It is not enough that I merely outsmart my foes, they must be shown their weakness and failure.  

Friedrich von Lichten has fully embraced contamination and transformed into a monster, and is now the [Pale Man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md). He has maintained his intellect, and drapes his hunched and withered figure in a black cloak. Beneath his paper-thin skin are wriggling and writhing things. His lidless eyes are sunken, his teeth are prominent, yellowing and decaying. One can just make out a sickly green tongue that darts out when he speaks. He talks in a stunted, almost exasperated tone.

He presents his estate as a safehouse for the lost and forgotten.

The Pale Man sows the rumours that he can help contaminated people so he can use them as test subjects for his experiments. When he meets a transformed or contaminated creature, he presents himself as a helpful expert, offering to treat any individual left in his care. He never actually cures contamination, but sometimes helps other transformed monsters become somewhat lucid so he can make better use of them as minions. The Pale Man spends most of his time in the repurposed master bedroom of the estate he uses as his laboratory, and gives orders only to his most trusted thralls.

![Henry](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/086-06-009.henry.webp#center)

#### Mutated Thralls

These three [haze hulks](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) are the most intelligent and loyal of the Pale Man's servants. They came to him willingly and embraced his alterations. The Pale Man allowed them to keep their lives and minds, and in exchange they serve him.

**Raven** a [gutbuster haze hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md), is a portly woman with blue skin, white glowing eyes, and thick stringy black hair wearing a burlap cloak with a hood. She is extremely cautious of visitors, but is often the first to greet and question people coming to the estate.

##### Henry

Henry, a [hunter haze hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md), is the most intelligent of the three. He wears black scraps of leather and has a long sallow face and large black eyes.

##### Grunt

Grunt, a [juggernaut haze hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md), is the biggest of the three, with beady eyes on his tiny bald head and a massive hulking body. He is usually found in the estate house or the stables working as the personal guard for the Pale Man.

##### Lisa

Lisa is the Pale Man's favourite creation, transformed by contamination into a [grotesque gargant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/grotesque-gargant-dodk.md). He used her as the conduit for many of his early attempts to siphon contamination, transforming her into the monster she now is.

#### Estate Grounds

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A grand mansion stands atop a rolling hill in the middle of this expansive walled estate. The steep terracotta roofs and grey stone walls are wracked with decay now. The windows are shattered and boarded over, the white-paint trim chipping away. Downhill from the main house is a large stable. Entering the grounds from the main gate, characters can see a stubby fieldstone tower with a small cottage abutting it, but the upper levels of the tower have collapsed. A small guardpost sits beside the creaking wrought-iron gates hanging from the fieldstone walls that surround the estate. Several dying trees dot the lawns, and a brackish pond rests west of the manor house. Several hooded figures wander the property. Some are watering flowers, others lounging about the grounds, while one is throwing rocks in the pond.
^3e8

- The property walls are ten feet tall and crested with spikes.  
- Almost all the windows are boarded up. Aside from a small window on the stables, each is purposely blocked from prying eyes.  
- 10 (`3d6`) other [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) are scattered around the courtyard tending to menial tasks or entertaining themselves.  
- Guard House. A small stone guard house sits next to the front gate. A small cloaked creature with a big toothy grin sits mumbling to himself and playing a game of cards alone.  
- This [delerium dreg](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) greets any who approach, asking their business. If characters seem peaceful, it will direct them to see Raven at the stables.  

#### Tower House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sickly moss and blighted ivy creep up from the ground and wrap around this tower. There is a small red-roofed cabin off the base, but the upper level of the tower has crumbled away.
^3ea

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Servant's Quarters.** There are several little creatures working here, they all seem to be reading through notes and relaxing at a small table. The rooms are filled with cots and bunk beds for the various dregs that inhabit the grounds to sleep and rest. There are only a few rooms so they are jammed with various sleeping surfaces. Everything from beds crudely piled on top of one another, or drawers pulled out and stuffed with hay and pillows. The dregs seemed pleased to sleep just about anywhere and the rooms show a disorganized cluttered mess of their living arrangements.
^3eb

- 5 [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) are lounging in this room.  
- [Henry](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) is keeping watch of the minions.  
- Scrawled on the wall here are several bits of graffiti that seem to be directed at the servants that used to live here. Most notably are the words "Don't forget your candle."  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Collapsed tower.** The walls are mostly intact on this second level, but the ceiling is long gone and the upper floor is covered in debris. A few empty cages are placed here.
^3ed

- Dregs use these cages as holding for misbehaving companions.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Stables.** Any sign that these stables were once used to house horses is gone, the inside stripped away and made into a makeshift workstation. The stables act as both a storage compartment for finished products of delerium dust, but also housing for the many dregs who reside in the estate. Several of the stalls are lined with hay, dirty blankets, and buckets. The front of the stables by the entrance have been made into a sort of shop where Raven sits at a small table with various potions and alchemical ingredients lined for display.
^3ef

- 30 [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) are found here either sleeping, performing menial tasks, or polishing the black coach.  
- [Raven](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) often oversees products, shipping and sales that all happen out of the stable.  
- [Grunt](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) sits telling stories to several of the delerium dregs resting here.  
- Secret Entrance. At the back of the stable is an old hatch that opens to a ladder down to the old tunnels below the manor.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Black Coach.** Parked in the stable is a beautiful and well-kept black coach with red curtained windows.
^3f1

- On rare occasions when the Pale Man travels the streets, he has his haze hulks pull him in this coach. He insists it be polished and cleaned daily.  

#### Mansion Ground Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mansion is a large two-storey property with east and west wings on either side of an entrance foyer accessed by two decorated double doors. Above the doors is a round stained glass window featuring a patterned radial design.
^3f4

- All windows are boarded up except for one on the front right that looks into one of the wretched drawing rooms.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Foyer.** Entering the house by the front door you come into an open room. A huge golden chandelier holds one hundred candles that flicker light and shadows around the foyer. Straight ahead a large staircase heads up to a second floor balcony overlooking the foyer. A huge circular stained glass window fills the room with coloured light. To the left and right are doors that lead to either of the wings, while flanking the grand staircase are two statues of majestic horses carved out of marble. The walls are lined with brilliant artwork depicting sunsets on fields, galloping wild horses, a snow covered valley with a small cottage and other beautiful scenic pictures that almost always include horses.
^3f5

- **Trapped Door.** The east door on the upper level is a heavy wooden door depicting a carving of winged beings soaring up towards the top of the door, and grotesque emaciated-looking creatures below reaching up to try and grab the fleeing angels. The door is [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and only the password "As Above, So Below" will allow one to access the door. The Pale Man uses this door to access the balcony over the foyer to give orders to his minions  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Wretched Drawing Rooms.** These once well-appointed drawing rooms are now covered in cobwebs and broken furniture, dismantled bookshelves, and dirty animal fur rugs. The rooms have been stripped of any valuables or usable goods.
^3f7

- There are 5 (`2d4`) [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) in each of these rooms.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Decrepit Dining Room.** Food and dirt cover the various walls and surfaces. Paintings are hanging crooked, while some have been broken. There is a long wooden feasting table with four chairs on either side and a grand throne-like seat at the far end. Faces are drawn over hanging portraits and crude words are scrawled across the wall in food substances or possibly blood.
^3f9

- There are 8 [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) eating. They know very well that this section of the manor is off limits to guests.  
- The food looks relatively unappetizing, a grey sludge with bits of what might be meat, but the creatures here seem keen to enjoy it.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Kitchen.** The kitchen is a mess with dirty pots and pans stacked almost to the ceiling. There are knives stuck in the walls, food and slop everywhere, and stains on nearly every surface. Two creatures in little makeshift chefs hats and aprons work diligently to make some sort of bland soup for the residents of the house, occasionally throwing in scraps they find on the floor into a big boiling pot.
^3fb

- 2 [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) are here and will attack anyone who interrupts them.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Lounge.** A couple couches and armchairs are pushed around an old fireplace. The fireplace is not lit, and has five candelabras set on its mantle with four candles placed in all but one. The furniture has been placed for convenience and conversation and less a proper attempt at outfitting a room.
^3fd

- There are 5 (`2d4`) [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) here.  
- Secret Entrance. There is a hatch on the ground in the corner that opens to an old stone staircase that goes down into the lower tunnels.  
- Secret Door. If a candle is placed in the empty candelabra on the fireplace mantle it opens the back of the fireplace into a small staircase that goes up to the second level.  

#### Mansion Upper Level

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Abandoned Bedchambers.** These once sumptuous bedchambers are now disheveled and foetid dens. Clothing has been pulled out of the wardrobes to make disgusting nests upon the shredded and broken beds.
^400

- 2 (`1d4`) [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) inhabit each bedchamber. Some dress up in the fine clothing that remains, or play with the childrens toys abandoned within.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Lab.** These adjacent rooms have been stripped of their previous furniture and refashioned into laboratories. There are various forms of equipment here. A table in the back has a strange hammer crafted from delerium and a crate of shards and crystals that are seemingly being smashed into dust. There are alchemical supplies and filtering devices that are used to refine the dust at another station. A third station has herbs and chemical formulas and measuring equipment for concocting arcane delerium dust as well as various delerium infused potions. It looks as though another station is for procuring delerium ink for spell scrolls and other uses.
^402

- 10 (`3d6`) assorted [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) work around the clock in this chamber at the various tables. Some have goggles or other scraps of lab gear.  
- Explosion. If combat occurs, one of the dregs hurls a half finished delerium concoction at the players, which functions as a [bottled comet](Mechanics/items/bottled-comet-dodk.md).  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Master Bedroom.** Lined with shelves of books, scrolls, folders, documents, and scattered parchments, this room appears to function as a library as well. Several shelves house glass jars with floating objects inside - a jar of eyeballs, a severed hand, an entire human head with one side of it dissolved and melted, several fleshy tentacles, and many other horrors. An old dust-covered bed in the corner appears unused. The desk is covered in various jars of octarine substances as well as an old book bound in red leather and a quill and inkwell of glowing octarine ink.
^404

- Secret entrance. The bookshelf on the back wall next to the bed has a large blue book titled "the Secret Stairs" - when pulled, it opens to the staircase leading down to the lounge.  
- Amongst the shelves one can find `1d4` magical potions, half of which are [healing potions](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md), and `1d6` uncommon [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md).  
- The spell book on the desk contains the Pale Man's work on the new spells he has created. It is also infused with a [glyph of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) to cast [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) when triggered. The Pale Man will grab his book and flee to his nest if need be.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Study.** As you step inside you see a mess of paperwork, tables, and several drawings stuck on the wall with red string connecting various sketches to locations in Drakkenheim. A large red circle on a map of the city indicates a focus on the Inscrutable Tower.
^406

- The Pale Man has put together a rough plan to seize the Inscrutable Tower for himself. The plans seem incomplete and so far most of his research involves how to get into the tower. He has two current ideas; the first note states the front door will only open for a living Academy member wearing *academy rings*, the second is research for creating flying minions to fly into the breach. Beyond this, he has not developed the means to control the Nexus.  

#### Underground Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Heading into the basement reveals a damp and dank cave. There is a thick moisture in the air and an acrid smell mixed with the scent of hot garbage. It's hard to pinpoint where the smells are coming from but it's unpleasant to say the least. There are a few torches along the cavern edge that seem to light the path ahead.
^409

- The lair is accessed from either the stables or the manor lounge. Originally it was a passage to get to the stables and feed the horses during heavy winters without having to go outside.  
- Since the Pale Man has moved in, he has expanded the caves below to suit his needs.  
- The entire underground section is protected by the [guards and wards](Mechanics/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell. The minions of the house are immune to its effects but any guests or intruders are not.  
- Once entered, the doors to this area vanish into the cave wall. They are still there and it is merely an illusion caused by the [guards and wards](Mechanics/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Collapsed Cavern.** It seems that an early attempt to expand the tunnels failed. There is a dreg crushed under a pile of rubble here, and there is no way past the rubble.
^40a

- The crushed dreg is clutching a candle and a vial of [aqua delerium](Mechanics/items/aqua-delerium-dodk.md).  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Holding Cells.** This area contains a barred jail with a small locked door. The walls and floor are caked with refuse and debris. The cell is filled with wriggling piles of flesh. The flesh has various eyes and mouths and occasional limbs or extremities protruding from them. As you approach the cell, the fleshy mounds begin to quiver and a chorus of sorrowful moans echo through the chamber.
^40c

- Two [dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) wander the tunnels down here and their job consists of feeding the "unfortunates" as they call them, and occasionally taking one out of the pen to feed Lisa.  
- If either of the two dregs feel threatened or feel the need to aid in an attack, they will run to pull a lever on the wall that opens the pen, allowing the "unfortunates" to wriggle out and consume anything in their path  
- There are 10 [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) that can be released from the pen.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Trapped Room.** A wrong turn due to the guards and wards spell, or a misguided search of the corridors and hallways might land you in this room. Once entered, a wooden gate slams over the entrance and the room releases a cloudkill effect.
^40e

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Lisa's Den.** This small alcove is covered in various bones, skeletons, bits of old meat and blood soaked scraps of clothing.
^410

- [Lisa](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/grotesque-gargant-dodk.md) resides here. Unless she hears commotion elsewhere in the tunnels or is retrieved by one of the dregs, she stays here eating.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **The Nest.** A cave-in at the entrance makes this room very hard to get to. However, this room is the most important room for the Pale Man. Covered floor to ceiling with dripping and oozing delerium sludge and caked with thousands of insectoid looking eggs, this room seems to resemble a sort of nest. Hanging from the ceiling is a large fleshy cocoon-like sack, pulsing gently with a sort of heartbeat.
^412

- If the Pale Man is reduced to 0 hit points he returns to this nest to recuperate.  
- Destroying the nest means the Pale Man is unable to regenerate and can be killed easily.  
- The cocoon has 100hp and an AC of 12. It is vulnerable to fire, but immune to poison, necrotic, and psychic damage.  
- The entire room is covered in delerium sludge.

However, the Academy Directorate jealously guards knowledge of this spell, and I am sure the Archmages would not cast this spell for anyone but themselves. Nevertheless, I believe it may be possible to draw the contaminants out of one body and into that of another.  
>     ^416

If the Pale Man survives, the Academy expresses the urgency that control of the tower needs to be obtained as soon as possible. The Silver Order is satisfied if the Pale Man was killed or brought in and his estate and research destroyed.

## Old Town Cistern

Beneath Slaughterstone Square is a large underground reservoir filled with the waterlogged corpses of the Executioner's many victims. As a result, the macabre chamber has become the favoured scavenging ground for a group of [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) who serve an eldritch creature known as the [Duchess](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md). This nightmarish entity lurks deep below Drakkenheim's forsaken waterways, slowly amassing contaminated thralls while fostering dark dreams to usurp control of the surface.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/089-06-010.old-town-cistern.webp#center)

### Overview

Your characters might simply stumble into the cistern while exploring the sewers, or by taking the smuggler's passage from the Black Ivory Inn. The cistern lies directly below Slaughterstone Square, so characters may even seek refuge here from the Executioner. You should review that location before reading this section further.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### An Invitation from the Duchess

While exploring the river, sewers, or another aquatic location, the characters encounter a curious group of 12 [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) and 2 [chuuls](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) who are not outwardly hostile. Two step forward peacefully with trepidation, introducing themselves as Blip-Bloop and Slurpy. They implore characters to help them find a suitable gift to bring back to their mistress, who they refer to as the "Duchess". If questioned, they can convey the following information:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - "Our Duchess will show you great hospitality, I'm sure of it! If you would bring her a gift or perform a service for her, she could reward you greatly, I'm sure of it! What is it you desire? Knowledge! Magic! Health! Our Duchess is as mighty as she is benevolent, I'm sure of it!"  
^41c

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - "She would love a magic trinket, or perhaps a great crystal, of course! I'm sure of it!"  
^41d

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - "The Duchess is ruler of the deep water, all that flows below is her domain! I'm sure of it! She shelters and protects us, and in turn we are her loyal retainers, I'm sure of it!  
^41e

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - "She dwells near a great pool that collects the sky-water. There is a terrible machine upon the surface, but we know a hidden way there by water! I'm sure of it!"  
^41f

If the characters refuse at this first meeting, or attack, it's possible they could encounter this group again (or similar ones) during their future adventures in the city. Don't force this hook upon the player characters: this is something they should investigate on their own initiative!

#### Alternate Hooks

It's easy to miss this adventure site, but since it contains an important *Seal of Drakkenheim*, you may need to troubleshoot. If your players don't take the bait, consider the following:

- One of the faction leaders asks characters to investigate the following rumour: "The bodies of many slain adventurers and faction agents are said to rest in the cistern beneath Slaughtstone Square. Who knows how many magic items are lost there?"  
- An encounter with aquatic dregs leaves behind a clue related to a character's personal quest, indicating the aquatic dregs possess a lost magic item or missing person (who is now transformed into one of the aquatic dregs or even the Duchess' attendants).  

### Interactions

The Duchess is an otherworldly abomination who holds many mutated aquatic delerium dregs in thrall, using them to gather delerium and lure unsuspecting explorers to its lair to contaminate.

#### The Duchess

The Duchess is an [aboleth](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) of unfathomable origin. Whether it was brought here by the unstable rifts of the Haze, or the result of some mutated origin, none can say. It uses its knowledge, telepathy, and mind-reading abilities to make deceptive offers that appeal to characters' deepest desires, manipulating them into embracing contamination so they will become its thralls.

- **Personality Trait.** I rule my subjects like a benevolent matron, and eagerly invite guests to my household so they can serve my will forever.  
- **Ideal.** The destiny of the Haze cannot be stopped, all will become contaminated and corrupt, all will bask within the eldritch embrace of distant stars.  
- **Bond.** I have heard the clarion call of the Amalgamation in Castle Drakken. Soon it will open a dimensional rift. I must seek servants and magic so I may seize it for myself.  
- **Flaw.** I grow angry and impatient when mortals do not regard me with fear and veneration.  

The Duchess is deeply in tune with the magic of the Haze. Though it does not know the origins of the meteor, the Duchess is aware that the Haze will eventually overtake the world and can sense the dimensional rift within Castle Drakken (see chapter 9). It is amassing delerium, magic items, and contaminated thralls with the hopes of one day seizing the rift and ruling the surface. It dimly understands the *Seals of Drakkenheim* may be useful in this regard, and so wants to acquire those items as well.

#### Duchess' Attendants

These three wretches are the favoured thralls of the Duchess. Called the Cardinal, the Chamberlain, and the Chancellor, each is a former human transformed by contamination. They use the game statistics for a [sea hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) with their creature type changed to aberration. The attendants use their powers to appear as humans garbed in flowing blue robes to lure and deceive visitors, but their mutations are more horrific than the aquatic delerium dregs, whom they regard as their subservient kin. Their original memories and personalities have been nearly obliterated by madness, and they now loyally serve the Duchess' strange agenda. They tend the Monument of the Duchess in the Bathhouse Ruins. The Chancellor is in truth the transformed Royal Chancellor of Drakkenheim, Balrin Barthes, and still wears the [Chancellor's Crest](Mechanics/items/chancellors-crest-dodk.md).

- **Personality Trait.** We are the attendants of the Duchess. Come see our customs and partake of our strange ways, and all will be revealed. The water holds great secrets; drink deeply of its knowledge.  
- **Ideal.** Our blessed offerings help the Duchess in her quest to open the way and the gate.  
- **Bond.** We escaped the castle but did not make it further. The Duchess has rescued us.  
- **Flaw.** We do not remember who we once were, but the Duchess tells us we must make preparations to one day rise from the waters to walk upon the surface once more.  

### Area Details

> ![Map 6.04: Old Town Cistern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/090-map-6.04-old-town-cistern.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/091-map-6.04-old-town-cistern-player.webp#gallery)

The water in these areas is contaminated. Characters who end their turn swimming or submerged in contaminated water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. A character who drinks contaminated water gains one level of contamination.

#### [1] Underground Cistern

This subterranean water reservoir is an eighty-foot-tall cylinder with a domed ceiling made from watertight concrete and flagstones. At the top is a five-foot-wide opening that leads to the receptacle fountain in Slaughterstone Square. A narrow five-foot-wide stone walkway is built twenty feet above the cylinder's base and rings a thirty-foot-diameter basin.

##### [1a] Basin

The reservoir below is almost full, the water line is only two feet below the edge of the walkway. The basin floor is filled with dozens of waterlogged corpses belonging to assorted members of the Hooded Lanterns, Queen's Men, and rival adventurers who ran afoul of the Executioner; their bodies tossed down here by the berserk construct. While most mundane equipment here is ruined, characters can collect a satchel with `2d6` delerium fragments inside, and a sack containing coins, gems, and other valuables worth 500 gp. If you wish, you may place `1d4` common magic items or a single uncommon magic item here.

- Two [chuuls](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) and 12 [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) pick over the treasures. If the characters found the cistern on their own, these are the group described in the Adventure Hooks section.  

##### [1b] Aqueduct Passage

Water is siphoned from the basin into this underground aqueduct; the middle of the ten foot diameter opening is roughly in line with the walkway. A barred grate can be removed with a DC 15 Strength check. Beyond is a barrel-shaped passage flooded to the hip. After it travels two hundred feet, there is a break in the ceiling that opens to the Bathhouse Ruins (below).

##### [1c] Sewer Canal

The slippery steps descend this wide stairway to the sewer system at large. A battered and broken gate once kept it closed. Where these canals lead is up to you.

##### [1d] Slaughterstone Stair

This narrow spiral staircase ascends sixty feet to the surface, and ends at a small landing with a short ladder leading to a heavy wrought-iron drainage cover three feet wide. Opening the cover from below requires an action and a DC 15 Strength check. It opens to Slaughterstone Square.

##### [1e] Smuggler's Tunnel

This wide spiral staircase ascends twenty feet then ends at a small landing leading to a roughly hewn arched tunnel four feet wide and eight feet tall. The passage snakes and twists for some distance before connecting to the basement of the Black Ivory Inn (see Outer City Ruins).

#### [2] Bathhouse Ruins

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This partially-buried rectangular chamber appears to be a bathhouse of the sort built in ancient antiquity. A pillared aisle borders a central pool set with a fine circular fountain decorated with statues of nymphs basking around a long-forgotten god. Bas-relief carvings along the walls depict primordial scenes of storms, shipwrecks, and vengeful aquatic monsters. At one end of the pool is a semicircular alcove where a massive delerium crystal as tall as a human juts through the floor. It is choked by a mass of thick pulsing veins and perspiring strange black nodules laced with prismatic colour. The glowing stone illuminates the room. Opposite the pool is a wide arched canal from which water flows into the chamber. The air is cold and damp, and the sound of running water echoes through the chamber. The vaulted ceiling overhead is cracked and buckling.
^42c

- The statue depicts the old god Nodens, god of sea and storms.  
- Three [sea hags](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) - The Chancellor, the Chamberlain, and the Cardinal - are here. They may also be encountered with 10 (`3d6`) [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) and possibly a [chuul](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md).  
- They are not initially hostile, and instead invite characters to drink contaminated water they have mixed with delerium dust, touch the delerium geode, and then communicate with the Duchess telepathically. The process will undoubtedly bring characters to the brink of a monstrous transformation.  
- ***Delerium*.** This is a massive delerium geode cluster. It's exceptionally difficult to remove, but growing around it are `2d6` delerium shards that can be more easily harvested. The Duchess' attendants touch the geode when they communicate telepathically with the Duchess, and refer to it as "the Monument of the Duchess."  
- ***Treasure*.** The Chancellor has prominently pinned the [Chancellor's Crest](Mechanics/items/chancellors-crest-dodk.md) upon their robes. This valuable item is one the *Seals of Drakkenheim*. Amongst the urns, bowls, and sacks kept here are `1d4` uncommon [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) or potions.  

#### [3] Hydra's Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is the collapsed ruin of a once-magnificent circular bath.
^42e

- A [hydra](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md) dwells here in thrall to the Duchess to serve as a personal guardian. It rarely leaves this chamber except to devour worthless minions.  

#### [4] Underground Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This massive cavern is awash in ocatrine light, illuminated by hundreds of tiny delerium crystals embedded in the cavern walls. Water flows from cracks between hanging stalactites, filling the large underground lake with dark water that shimmers and reflects the delerium's sickly light. The air is heavy with moisture, and mucus-like slime washes up on the bank, thick globs of scum cling to the stones. The smallest sound echoes through the chamber with an eerie reverb.
^430

- The underground lake begins shallow but quickly reaches a depth of thirty feet. The stalactite-covered cavern ceiling is only fifteen feet above the surface.  
- This is the lair of the [Duchess](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md). The creature hides beneath the dark water. If it senses hostile intruders, it attempts to lure them close to the banks so it can pull them into the contaminated water easily.  
- If attacked, the Duchess sends out a psychic call to its underlings, and 4 [merrow](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/merrow.md) and 12 [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) arrive five rounds later to help protect the Duchess.  
- ***Delerium*.** The cavern walls contain countless small sparkling flakes of delerium, but with several hours of excavation characters can unearth 10 (`3d6`) delerium shards and `1d4` delerium crystals. Characters inspecting the cavern walls can detect that the delerium crystals are embedded in the rock. There's simply no way these shards came from the meteor, they're too far underground.  
- Below the water's surface is a wide underground river that connects to the Drann River.  
- A mound of loose dirt and sand is not visible above the water's surface, but obvious to any who dive underwater. Digging the mound out takes one minute of work, and contains the Duchess's personal treasure. It contains `1d4` delerium crystals, `1d6` watertight tubes each containing a rare [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md), `3d6` other gemstones or treasures worth 250 gp each, and a rare magic item.  

> [!note] Developments
> 
> Regardless of whether or not the characters can learn anything from the Duchess, slaying this abomination puts an end to a terrible scourge before it festers and worsens. Left unchecked, the Duchess could become a potential interloper who interferes in future events. Alternatively, the Duchess may decide to pursue its interests elsewhere, leaving Drakkenheim via the contaminated Drann River. It travels downstream towards the ocean and spreads its corrupting influence into the wider world.
> 
> **The Chancellor's Crest.** Characters who recover the [Chancellor's Crest](Mechanics/items/chancellors-crest-dodk.md) have a major find. As one of the missing *Seals of Drakkenheim*, it's one of the keys to the city. Should the Hooded Lanterns and the Queen's Men discover the characters possess it, they'll make overtures to meet them. Both Elias Drexel and the Queen of Thieves use this as an opportunity to recruit the characters to their faction's cause. If the characters turn down the offer, these factions begin drawing up plans to take the *Chancellor's Crest* by stealth, trickery, or even force if necessary.

## Queen's Park

Resting in the northern heart of the city between the Inscrutable Tower and Castle Drakken, Queen's Park was built to honor the Queens of Drakkenheim who ruled as monarchs, but those who were royal consorts have also been commemorated here. Over time, more monuments to other well-known women who defined the history of Drakkenheim were constructed here as well. Commonfolk and nobles alike spoke of fondly losing themselves in Queen's Park as they wandered its elegant beauty on summer afternoons. Now covered by the Deep Haze, one might indeed become lost here forever.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/092-06-011.queen-harden.webp#center)

### Overview

An expedition to Queen's Park, originally seeking key ingredients for [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), may eventually lead characters to a shocking discovery regarding the fate of a royal family member.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Gathering Eldritch Lilies

Characters who find the research of Oscar Yoren or hear certain rumours may learn of the magical flowers growing in Queen's Park said to have resistive properties against contamination. Those who research further can learn the following about them:

- An eldritch lily is a pink-purple flower that grows in pools of contaminated water within natural areas covered by the Deep Haze. The plants have a strange odor, and emit a magical ringing sound audible within ten feet. They register a distinct magical aura when inspected with [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md). A single eldritch lily is worth 100 gp. The petals are potent alchemical reagents, and can be used as a component for restorative spells and many potions.  

### Interactions

While characters explore Queen's Park, they can learn the tragic fate of Queen Lenore von Kessel, and even locate the former royal consort.

The day the meteor fell, chaos erupted in Castle Drakken as the staff and royal family attempted to escape the Haze. At the behest of the royal steward, Queen Lenore's retainers helped her escape Castle Drakken via a secret waterway that exits at Queen's Park. Hindered by Lenore's baggage train, the royal entourage became lost in the spreading mist, and were transformed into monsters. They have remained here ever since, driven to madness with little remaining of their memories.

#### Lost Lenore

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This melancholic creature stands six feet tall with long, thin limbs. Her chalky white skin is cracked and rigid like stone, and her hair is a writhing mass of thick wet tendrils that end in toothy maws. She wears an emerald necklace and a distressed black ball gown. She covers her hair with a shawl and her face with a cracked porcelain mask.
^439

[Lenore von Kessel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lenore-von-kessel-dodk.md), the Queen-Consort of Drakkenheim and wife of Ulrich IV has become a monster that uses the game statistics of a [medusa](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md). Replace the normal *Petrifying Gaze* trait and actions with the following:

- ***Radiant Gaze*.** When a creature that can see Lenore's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, Lenore can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if she isn't [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and can see the creature. The creature takes 22 (`4d10`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, creatures who fail this saving throw gain one level of contamination.  
- Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Lenore until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Lenore in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.  
- If Lenore sees herself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light, she becomes [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) for `1d6` hours.  
- ***Tentacle Hair*.***Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit*: 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.  

Transformed by the Haze, Lenore is a mockery of her former self and abhorrently reacts to her own appearance. She dimly remembers seeking shelter in her grotto, but has no recollection of how she escaped the castle.

- **Personality Trait.** I speak softly in a perpetual daydream, rhapsodically imagining myself to be in a tragic fairytale while casting others in fictional roles.  
- **Ideal.** The world is a mirror held up to my own glorious reflection.  
- **Bond.** I obsessively crave beauty, decadence, and relish in art of all kinds, and especially love my garden and my lilies. They are all I have left.  
- **Flaw.** I fly into an enraged fury at the sight of my own likeness or the names of my lost family members.  

Any character proficient in [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) can instantly recognize Lenore despite her mutations. Before her transformation, Lenore was extraordinarily vain and narcissistic, though was uncharastically kind and gentle to her servants. She wore outrageously ornamented gowns, hats, makeup, and jewelry, including a famous golden necklace set with eleven emeralds. She loved her children only as extensions of herself, and absolutely despised her husband.

#### Queen's Retinue

The transformed creatures that once were Lenore's personal attendants each use the game statistics for a [dryad](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md). Now called the handmaidens, they resemble disheveled and misshapen figures clad in moss-covered petticoats, their hair like slimy grass and skin like knobbly bark.

- Just as they did in their former lives, these unfortunate wretches attend, obey, and protect Lenore, but have only fragmented memories of their own.  
- They act avoidant, timid, and servile, but are resolute in their duties. They use their abilities to mislead and prevent intruders from reaching the royal grotto while wandering the garden searching for delerium and eldritch lilies to bring back to please Lenore.  
- If interacted with, characters may be able to coax the handmaidens into leading them to the royal grotto by succeeding on three DC 15 Charisma checks, perhaps portraying themselves as valiant knights here to help or conjuring some other fable. Otherwise, characters can follow or chase them back to the royal grotto.  

In addition, many of the [haze wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) wandering the garden are the undead remnants of the Queen's personal guard, and still bear the crests and livery of House von Kessel.

### Area Details

#### Entering Queen's Park

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The labyrinthian footpaths of Queen's Park saunter by baroque-style flower beds in geometrical layouts, down winding paths through forested groves, and over ornamented bridges that cross artificial streams and ponds. The lawns and plazas are decorated with triumphal arches, marble fountains, statuary gardens, and hedge mazes, but the park has become overgrown, desolate, and blanketed by thick glimmering mists. Hardy vines cling to the statues like leeches, and strange flowers in unnatural hues bloom in the gardens. A potent pollen hangs in the air - a smell between musk and sweet perfume. It tingles the nostrils, and irritates the eyes slightly. The garden is quiet, the sounds of footsteps linger loudly. There is no sign of a single animal, not even a bird or rodents, but the plant life flourishes despite the lack of sun and influx of rain.
^43d

- Queen's Park Garden is entirely suffused by the Deep Haze (see chapter 5)  

#### Navigating the Garden

Queen's Park Garden trades the streets, alleys, and ruined buildings of the city proper for footpaths, garden trails, flowerbeds, monuments, and forested groves. As such, characters move through the region just as they do the city streets.

#### Searching the Garden

Characters looking for an eldritch lily must attempt Searching the Ruins for one hour, as described in "Navigating Drakkenheim" in chapter 5. In addition to making [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) checks, characters may use [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History), [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival) to help search the gardens. Success requires a DC 15 check result, with any check result of 20 or higher granting an additional success. What the characters find each attempt is based on their number of successes:

| Number of Successes | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| 1 success or fewer | Nothing |
| 2 successes | Brackish Pool |
| 3 successes | Eldritch Lily Pond |
| 4 or more successes | Royal Grotto |
^number-of-successes-result

Two or more failed check results triggers one of the random encounters below. Don't forget that characters are exposed to the Deep Haze each hour they spend here!

^1-random-encounter

##### Turned Around

The characters find themselves at the edge of the garden near one of the many entrances into the grounds. They can make out rows of buildings and streets just beyond a high and moss covered rocky wall that surrounds the garden. They must have gotten turned around somewhere back there.

##### Garden Gnomes

A thin path winds through a grassy clearing. The grass is lush and green, perhaps the most vibrant grass within ten miles of the city. On either side of the path is a beautiful decorated floral garden. The gardens are lined with fluorescent purple flowers accented with hints of orange, yellow, or green. They are not eldritch lilies, but to the untrained eye they may appear to be. A DC 20 [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature) check reveals them to be false lilies. Four small garden gnomes stand within the gardens, one on either end of the two floral beds. If the players step onto the grass or pick any of the flowers they immediately hear a voice screech out to them: "KEEP. OFF. THE. GRASS!"

- The garden gnomes are insane gnome [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md), who spring to life and attack any who interfere with their lush garden.  

##### Weeping Willow

A sad-looking willow tree hangs before a vine-covered stone bridge built across a gentle babbling creek at the base of a small waterfall. Purple and yellow vibrant flowers bloom all across the bridge's thick vines. The tree sways in an eerie breeze, while fastened to its trunk a small elegant rowboat bobs gently in the creek.

- As players approach the tree, it awakens as a mad [treant](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/treant.md).  
- Abandoned in the boat is a small hairpin with the crest of the von Kessel family upon it, as well as a book titled "The Gardens of Skye" that details exotic lilies and other flora. Inside the cover of the book is an inscription that reads "To my dear mother Lenore, From Katarina."  
- Behind the waterfall is a ten foot wide underground canal that stretches off into darkness. There are no walkways, and one thousand feet down the canal, the water becomes thick delerium sludge that is home to `1d4` [animated delerium sludges](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/animated-delerium-sludge-dodk.md). The canal gently bends and snakes upward, eventually ending in the cistern of the royal palace of Castle Drakken (see chapter 9).  

##### Wight Knights

Six [haze wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) wander the garden, and hungrily attack any living creatures they encounter. They wear the livery of House von Kessel.

- One of the wights has a letter on his person that bears the seal of the royal steward (see the "Steward's Letter" in the Developments section).  
- With the information from the note, the characters are granted advantage on their next "Searching the Garden" roll.  

##### The Three Angels

Three statues of weeping angels stand facing the middle of this clearing. The central statue is significantly larger than the other two, and is choked in thick vines with pulsing spores. Between them is an old stone podium entangled in overgrowth.

![Lenore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/093-06-012.lenore.webp#center)

- Removing the plants reveals a map of the gardens engraved upon the stone surface. Any interaction with the statues or the map causes the three statues to spring to life: the smaller two become [gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md), and the larger one uses the stat block of a [vrock](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md).  
- Examining the map gives characters advantage on their next "Searching The Garden" roll.  

##### Ghost Lights

5 (`2d4`) [will-o-wisps](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) float within the trees of this thick wooded area. If followed, they attempt to lure characters into the woods towards a grove ringed by beautiful glowing fluorescent flowers. A dead mage lays in the middle of the floral patch.

- Any who inspect the body cause a vengeful [arcane wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/arcane-wraith-dodk.md) to emerge that is immediately hostile. The will-o-wisps attack along with the wraith.  
- Upon the corpse is an uncommon magic item, as well as `1d4` rare *potions* or [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md).  

##### Monument of The Queen's Men

A monument of the original Queen's Men rests here. It depicts the regiment of castle guards dedicated to protecting the Queens of Drakkenheim. The monument has been defaced with graffiti and crude drawings left by outlaws of the current Queen's Men. An old burrow behind the monument used to be a campsite but is now home to 2 hungry [trolls](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/troll.md).

- The trolls can be bargained with, offering directions to the royal grotto, where they found lots of glowing flowers. In exchange, they want to eat one of the characters' limbs.  
- If the trolls are bargained with, characters have advantage on their next "Searching the Garden" roll.  

##### Handmaidens Grove

Nestled between hedgerows is a beautiful topiary garden with bushes trimmed into elegant designs depicting mythological creatures. Tending the garden are 7 (`2d6`) of Lenore's [handmaidens](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) (described above).

#### Brackish pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small pond is covered in a thin layer of algae that floats upon the glimmering surface of the water. Amongst the aquatic plant life are three large yellow lilies.
^44a

- Examining the water with a DC 10 [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) check determines that it is contaminated.  
- The three flowers are [hypnotic eldritch blossoms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/hypnotic-eldritch-blossom-dodk.md) that attempt to lure characters into the pond.  
- If the water is disturbed, an [animated delerium sludge](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/animated-delerium-sludge-dodk.md) emerges and attacks.  

#### Eldritch Lily Pond

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small artificial pond is surrounded by prismatic cherry blossom trees. Reeds spring up around the muddy bank, and throngs of algae grow beneath the water's surface, which is blanketed with clusters of lily pads. Blooming from the water are several large lily flowers with brightly scintillating pink-purple petals. They emit a sweet strange smell and a melodic arcane hum.
^44c

- Characters find this location with three successful checks when they Search the Garden (see above).  
- Standing in the contaminated water are 5 (`2d4`) of the Queen's [handmaidens](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) (see Interactions above), gathering the lilies with care to bring back to Lenore in the royal grotto.  
- There are 5 (`2d4`) eldritch lilies blooming in the pond, but also 2 (`1d4`) [hypnotic eldritch blossoms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/hypnotic-eldritch-blossom-dodk.md) (the blossoms ignore the Queen's handmaidens).  

### Royal Grotto

Characters who search for eldritch lilies and achieve four successes find the royal grotto.

![Map 6.05: Royal Grotto Tiered Garden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/094-map-6.05-royal-grotto-tiered-garden.webp#center)

#### Tiered Garden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This regal garden is decorated with opulent stone staircases with pillared railings that ascend between the tiers. The main garden is highlighted by two large shimmering pools, bordered with tiled stone, while multiple lilies float upon the glistening water, pulsing gently with an eldritch glow. Several gnarled and beautiful cherry blossom trees accent the tiers of the garden in an eternal state of bloom, while petals of hot pink, electric blue, and neon violet fall softly, covering the entire area in waves of colour.
> 
> The bubbling of fountains and rustling of wind through trees add a peaceful ambiance to the garden, which is decorated with many statues of a tall woman with elegant limbs wearing outrageous dresses and costumes. The face of each statue has been chiseled off . Centred on the upper tier is a statue of the same figure with a lily in her hand, and like the others the face of the statue has been carved away. Light marble walls separate the tiers and are etched with relief carvings of faces of princesses, queens, maidens and many others who served the von Kessels. Moss, ivy, and unnaturally bright flowers cling to many of the statues and walls. Nestled between the staircases and pools is a set of large beaten brass doors, colour shifted and oxidized by years of wear. The doors have a floral patterned border and two massive handles shaped like lilies. These doors are the entrance to the grotto below.
^44f

- Entering the tiered garden awakens 2 [shambling mounds](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) and `2d4` [hypnotic eldritch blossoms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/hypnotic-eldritch-blossom-dodk.md) that attempt to lure characters into the contaminated pools.  
- A DC 10 [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) Check by a player proficient in the skill can determine that these statues are all of Lenore von Kessel

![Map 6.06: Royal Grotto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/095-map-6.06-royal-grotto.webp#center)

#### [1] Grotto Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Descending the stairs leads to a circular vaulted chamber decorated floor to ceiling with mosaics. The geometric patterns depict magical aquatic humanoids such as merfolk, nymphs, and water weirds delightfully relaxing in fantastically extravagant yet everyday activities: playing sports, enjoying meals, taking baths, and cavorting with terrestrial lovers. The chamber is comfortably cool and filled with a pleasant moist odor; the sound of gurgling water echoes down the hall.
> 
> In the middle of the chamber is a circular fountain set with a nymph-like figure holding a trident and a vase. Water pours from the opening to fill the fountain with crystal clear water. Around and within the fountain are arranged painted ceramic vases, glass collectables, and loose coins.
> 
> The mosaics extend along short hallways leading to the east and west, ending in smaller rooms of similar construction. Arches set with barred iron gates are cut into the walls in three places. Each leads to a roughly hewn and stepped cavernous passage that descends gently while twisting sharply south.
^451

- A character proficient in mason's tools or with stonecunning can tell the cavernous passages are completely artificial, and not a naturally-formed cavern.  
- 10 (`3d6`) [handmaidens](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) appear using their *tree stride* power in the roots within the following chambers and make a last ditch attempt to drive away intruders.  

#### [2] Wellspring

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two yawning stone pipes disgorge streams of sweet-smelling water into a pool in this cavernous chamber. The water is luminescent with a pinkish-purple sheen. Thick roots from the trees above have broken through the walls to sip the collected water. The pond empties gently down a passage that bends southwest.
^453

- The pool is three feet deep, and the water within is contaminated. The pipe openings are about a foot wide.  

#### [3] Statuary Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stepped caverns converge in a rectangular chamber. Part of the chamber is finished stonework, the rest remains roughly hewn. Several statues have been carved directly from the rock. The finished chamber contains twenty statues depicting Lenore von Kessel lining the long walls. A large statue of the royal family sits at the end of this chamber, depicting King Ulrich, Queen Lenore, and their two daughters. The faces of any statue depicting Queen Lenore have been sheared off.

- An inscription on the family monument reads "...for my lovely Lenore, on the anniversary of our royal union."—King Ulrich von Kessel IV  

#### [4] Underground Pond

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An underground pond fills most of this large artificial cavern, filled by a flowing stream to the west. The water glows softly with prismatic light, and across the surface are dozens of purple-pink eldritch lilies. The great roots from the trees above have broken through the ceiling in places to drink deeply from the lambent water.
> 
> An exquisitely upholstered velvet chaise lounge with gold-painted armrests and plush pillows is set atop several overlapping woven rugs. Scattered around the furnishings lies the extensive baggage train of a fabulously wealthy noblewoman. A mahogany chest of drawers is overflowing with pompous gowns, fashionable dresses, multicoloured wigs, oversized hats, and fantastically impractical shoes. An oaken coffer is brimming with elaborate jewellery, and several smaller containers, suitcases, and baskets are overstuffed with more clothing, artwork, gems, and coins.
> 
> Several portraits and paintings are arranged about the chamber. Many paintings show a noblewoman wearing a golden necklace set with eleven emeralds, but within each the face has been torn off. One painting shows the woman posing with a noble family: a young teen man, two girls - one perhaps eight, the other no more than five - and a portly and bearded man wearing a crown.

- **Lenore.** resides here. If anyone touches the eldritch lilies or provokes her flaws, she tears away her veil and attacks while prismatic light emanates from her eyes, nose, and mouth.  
- **Treasure.** Queen Lenore's emerald necklace is worth 10,000 gp. However, the necklace is famous. Anyone with the coinage to *buy* it knows that it would be immediately recognized as belonging to the royal family. Lenore wears a diamond-set [ring of protection](Mechanics/items/ring-of-protection.md) bearing the royal seal. The other costumes and accoutrements here are mostly ruined, but `1d4` pieces worth 250 gp are salvageable. `1d6` delerium crystals and `2d6` shards can be harvested here.  
- **Eldritch Lilies.** Lenore's [handmaidens](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) have collected 35 (`10d6`) eldritch lilies and gathered them in the pool here, but they don't normally grow in this location.  

> [!note] Developments
> 
> Characters may have come to Queen's Park seeking flowers, but could leave with a royal problem.
> 
> **Lenore.** Lenore can be kept tranquil or pacified by characters who play into her delusions, or temporarily [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) if she sees her own face. It may be possible to capture her or bring her out of the Garden, but as a contaminated creature she'll die in a few days if taken outside the Haze.
> 
> The former Queen is a powerful symbol of the old monarchy. As such, should Elias Drexel and the Hooded Lanterns learn of her survival, they demand Lenore be placed under their custody in the Drakkenheim Garrison. If the characters accept, the Hooded Lanterns reward the characters with an appropriate boon for their deed. This act alone cements the support of the Hooded Lanterns, and they'll look favourably upon an alliance with another faction the characters might be working alongside. However, should the characters refuse, the Hooded Lanterns cast them as royal kidnappers. Elias Drexel expends every effort to rescue Lenore and bring the party to justice.
> 
> If Lenore was killed and the characters inform Hooded Lanterns, the soldiers are devastated, but don't seek retribution. They understand the characters did what they had to do against a contaminated monster. Even still, this blunder means Elias Drexel no longer believes the characters have the best interests of Drakkenheim in mind. Unless they prove otherwise through greater deeds, the Hooded Lanterns become ambivalent about working with the party in the future.
> 
> **.** **Curing Lenore.** Unfortunately, the Hooded Lanterns don't possess the means to reverse Lenore's transformation, and must turn to the other factions for help:
> 
> - The Silver Order makes an honest effort to use cleric spells to cure Lenore, but this fails. As such, they suggest a swift and merciful death is the most honorable course for a contaminated creature such as Lenore. They demand the Hooded Lanterns euthanize her as a condition for any future alliance.  
> - The Amethyst Academy offers to help find a way to reverse her transformation in return for help retaking the Inscrutable Tower. They suggest the characters seek out the Pale Man to acquire his research. If these works are turned over to the Academy, the mages will aid the characters in developing the [siphon contamination](Mechanics/spells/siphon-contamination-dodk.md) spell.  
> - The Queen of Thieves suspects a wish from the Crown of Westemär could be used to cure Lenore, but reveals this information carefully. Naturally, if the Hooded Lanterns keep Lenore in the Drakkenheim Garrison, the Queen's Men stage a kidnapping attempt for ransom!  
> - The Followers of the Falling Fire don't care much for the old monarchy, but Lucretia Mathias offers to call upon her divine powers to restore Lenore to her human form. This requires a great show of faith: Lucrecia Mathias only agrees to perform the miracle if Elias Drexel and the Hooded Lanterns leadership agree to join the Followers of the Falling Fire by taking the Sacrament.  
> 
> **Queen-Regent.** If her transformation is somehow reversed, Lenore has the statistics of a human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md). While she could possibly take up the throne as a Queen-Regent, this is an extremely dubious claim. Lenore was wed into House von Kessel, and so her political authority comes from her spouse and children. Worse, while Lenore adores the trappings of power and wealth, she loathes actual political responsibility. She wields her influence for personal gain only. Still, she could prove instrumental in confirming the identity of her offspring, but she doesn't know where they are or what happened to them.
> 
> **Eldritch Lilies and Aqua Expurgo.** Creating one dose of [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md) requires alchemical tools and eight hours of work by a character who knows the formula and can cast spells of 3rd level or higher. The recipe calls for one eldritch lily flower, 150 gp in alchemical reagents, and two ounces of blood taken from a contaminated monster.
> 
> Oscar Yoren and his apprentices can produce the potion given the materials, as can the Amethyst Academy, the Hooded Lanterns, and the Followers of the Falling Fire if they are given the formula.
> 
> **.** **Cultivating an Eldritch Lily Garden.** Rather than continually revisiting the garden to acquire more flowers, inventive characters might propose creating a garden of their own. Characters who carefully collect two dozen complete eldritch lily plants - not just the flowers - can begin their own plot. They'll need a location within the Haze with ample contaminated water, as eldritch lily plants taken out of the Haze wilt and die within twenty four hours. The strongholds of the Followers of the Falling Fire and the Hooded Lanterns, as well as Reed Manor, are suitable sites for a safely accessible lily garden, but the Amethyst Academy has the means to create one at their remote strongholds as well.
> 
> This ensures a consistent supply of reagents for crafting [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), and working with a faction or Oscar Yoren allows each character to receive one dose at the outset of any mission. Characters who wish to create additional doses must either do so themselves or provide extra gold and materials to ensure the garden isn't overfarmed.

## Rose Theatre

The Rose Theatre was the latest in a long line of playhouses in Drakkenheim that typically remained for a few decades before horribly burning down. The three story circular theatre with a thrust stage and open-air auditorium was once a hub for popular entertainment in the city. Throngs of common folk attended bawdy comedies, exaggerated and bloody histories, and dramatic tragedies written by highly competitive bards. Now it lays abandoned within the Haze, devoid of any laughter, music, or applause.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/096-06-013.rose-theatre.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, characters explore the mysterious Rose Theatre, which is oddly sheltered from the city ruins by an invisible barrier, guarded by uncontaminated elemental creatures and arcane constructs. Here, the characters encounter Ryan Greymere, a talented [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) who abandoned the Amethyst Academy. Though she has been branded a malfeasant wizard, Ryan Greymere doesn't practice contaminated magic, unlike Oscar Yoren and the Pale Man. Instead, she's crafted a potent suit of magic armour that protects against contamination.

It's up to the player characters how to deal with her. They can slay her to claim her magic items and seize her spellbooks, but could gain much by negotiating with her. They might even be able to broker an agreement to admit her back into the Amethyst Academy.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Dangerous Minds

Ryan Greymere has been in the sights of the Amethyst Academy for some time. Although she was a dear friend of Eldrick Runeweaver, she was also a fierce rival. They want to know what she is up to in the ruins and what her research has uncovered about delerium.

##### Misguided Mage

Knights of the Silver Order would like to see her brought to justice. As a practitioner of magic who has abandoned the Edicts of Lumen, the Silver Order believes it is their duty to destroy her research and bring Ryan Greymere in for imprisonment, but they are just as happy if the players take her down.

### Interactions

Ryan Greymere aggressively responds to intruders into the Rose Theatre, but intends to incapacitate trespassers so she can find out why they are there. Since she is hiding alone in the Inner City under magical defenses, she expects anyone who has penetrated the magical barrier is an Amethyst Academy assassin sent to kill her. However, she'll stay her hand if intruders attempt parley, but she'll try to flee before she can be captured.

#### Ryan Greymere

![Ryan Greymere](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/097-06-014.ryan.webp#center)

Once highly regarded within the Amethyst Academy, Ryan Greymere's trailblazing research led to many early discoveries about delerium, and she designed many of the procedures used by the Academy to make magic items using the crystals. However, she shocked the Directorate by presenting a dramatic plan for the Amethyst Academy to overtly seize control of Drakkenheim by force. Such action would grossly overstep the Edicts of Lumen, but Greymere flippantly replied that the realms and clergy were in no place to actually enforce the Edicts anymore. As a result, she was branded malfeasant, disavowed by the Academy, and most insultingly, the Directorate took credit for her discoveries. She fled into Drakkenheim, and now plans on gaining access to the Inscrutable Tower and continuing her research in private.

Ryan Greymere is a human woman in her mid-forties. Armoured head to toe and wearing white robes, her spectral appearance has garnered her the moniker the "Iron Banshee".

- **Personality Trait.** Get to the point on a topic that excites me, or don't waste my time.  
- **Ideal.** Only wizards can unlock the mysteries of delerium and protect the world from the Haze, but we cannot do that if we are hindered by the Edicts of Lumen.  
- **Bond.** I greatly miss my friends and colleagues in the Amethyst Academy, but I'm furious about the way I was treated by the Directorate.  
- **Flaw.** I'm not wasting my time with boot-licking fools looking to restore a worthless monarchy.  

Ryan Gremere is a human [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) who wears [hazewalker plate](Mechanics/items/hazewalker-plate-dodk.md), [boots of flying](Mechanics/items/winged-boots.md), and carries a [wand of lightning bolts](Mechanics/items/wand-of-lightning-bolts.md).

In addition to the spells she has prepared, her spellbook contains [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md), [ride the rifts](Mechanics/spells/ride-the-rifts-dodk.md), and [octarine spray](Mechanics/spells/octarine-spray-dodk.md).

##### Survival in the Haze

Ryan Greymere uses the [magnificent mansion](Mechanics/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion.md) spell each day to conjure a sanctuary where she can rest. She doesn't keep living quarters in the theatre.

##### Bound Elementals

Ryan Greymere's elementals were conjured and bound to her service via [planar binding](Mechanics/spells/planar-binding.md) and unquestionably obey her.

### Area Details

#### Approach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Rose Theatre is a ring-shaped three-storey wooden playhouse with the central auditorium open to the sky.
^46d

#### Force Barrier

The whole theatre is protected by a hemispherical [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) generated by a massive delerium geode. The barrier encloses the entire building, its perimeter about twenty feet outside the walls and about fifty feet above the rooftops of the theatre.

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md). A [disintegrate](Mechanics/spells/disintegrate.md) spell destroys the wall instantly, however it reforms ten minutes later. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall. Teleportation magic can bypass the wall, such as a [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) or [misty step](Mechanics/spells/misty-step.md) spell.

#### Playhouse

The playhouse is a circular open air auditorium with a rectangular stage. Most performances were held here during daylight hours to use natural lighting.

##### The Stage

This large rectangular wooden platform is built at the north end of the auditorium, connected to the backstage house by exits leading into the wings. Two large wooden pillars support an overhanging rooftop that extends from the backstage house.

- Ryan Greymere has set up her arcane lab upon the stage.  

##### Balcony Galleries

These wooden and pillared galleries are set with several raked rows of wooden benches, separated by evenly-spaced aisles. At the centre is a special box seat for the wealthiest patrons, and many disintegrating cushions, pamphlets, bits of old food and pitchers are left behind.

##### Auditorium

This gravel-filled courtyard has no seating: commonfolk stood here to watch performances instead. It is open to the air above.

- An [air elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) and a [water elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) patrol here.  

##### Barrier Generator

This complex arcane apparatus set up on the stage powers the force barrier. Anchored by a delerium geode, it requires a constant supply of delerium to maintain. It has AC 20 and 100 hit points. If destroyed, the force barrier fails, triggering a random arcane anomaly.

#### Backstage

The backstage house is a rectangular construction built into the overall circular shape of the entire theatre that contains the storage and administrative offices of the theatre.

##### The Wings

Mouldering red curtains are hung over the doorways leading into this narrow carpeted hallway. During performances actors made their entrances and exits via this corridor; it connects the stage to the green rooms backstage. There are many shelves holding old props, several cracked mirrors, and old lamps back here. Actors have left behind notes, love-letters, and graffiti.

##### Green Room

Actors waiting for their cue rested here during a performance, and socialized here between performances. Bottles of wine, flower bouquets, fluttering pages from play scripts, and notebooks filled with poems, sonnets and bawdy drawings are scattered about.

##### Wardrobes

Contains an array of costumes. Many appear fantastically decorated, but even casual inspection reveals the gemstones and gold trim are glass beads and painted fakery.

##### Dressing Room

Actors donned their costumes and makeup in these rooms. Several broken mirrors and drawers of powder, wigs, and makeup are still here.

##### Offices

The writers and managers used these rooms. Writing desks, old playbills, and records of the ticket sales can be found here. A lockbox holds the funds, totalling 1,000 gp.

> [!note] Developments
> 
> As long as the player characters agree to help Ryan Greymere she is willing to grant them access to her research. Characters who either obtain her notes, or work with her can find the following.
> 
> **Ryan Greymere's Research.** Characters can learn the following from speaking with Ryan Greymere or studying her writing:
> 
> - **Formation of Delerium Crystals.** "Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into delerium. The stones slowly draw more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities, and alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast quantities of delerium. These chaotic energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates."  
> - **Emergence of Dimensional Rifts.** "As it expands, the Haze both transforms the landscape, but it also conjures magical energy from the Space Between Worlds. I'm concerned that in areas where magic was already concentrated or where the borders between worlds are thin, it could result in catastrophic dimensional rifts."  
> - **Possible containment.** "Delerium presents an existential danger, but also opportunity. The concentration of delerium in Drakkenheim could provide an infinite supply of magical energy if directly harnessed, rather than simply crafting items individually. I've found promising results so far at collecting the energy given off by the stones - the problem is storage and containment. The abjurations required are just outside my wheelhouse. If it could be accomplished at-scale, not only would it be possible to fuel endless magical creations, it might actually slow the growth of the Haze, even hold it at equilibrium."  
> - **Hazewalker Plate and Bottled Comet Schematics.** Ryan Gremere's research notes include the formula and blueprints to create these items (See Appendix D).  
> 
> Ryan Greymere keeps her research within a [secret chest](Mechanics/spells/leomunds-secret-chest.md). If she's killed, the contents become forever lost on the Ethereal Plane.
> 
> **Ryan Greymere's Wishes.** Ryan Greymere wants to be allowed to continue her research in Drakkenheim and is upfront with characters about her relationship with the Academy, and her disdain for the monarchy. She scoffs at the idea of restoring the royal bloodline, and feels the world is better off without kings and queens. If player characters decide to help Ryan Greymere, she asks that they bring her a delerium geode for each character who wants [Hazewalker Plate](Mechanics/items/hazewalker-plate-dodk.md). She will construct the armour for the characters but she requires access to the Inscrutable Tower.
> 
> **.** **Rejoining the Academy.** Ryan Greymere holds no grudges against Eldrick Runeweaver or River, but is very open with her opinions on the Academy Directorate. However, she understands that a lot of their decisions are forced on them by the Edicts of Lumen, and regards the Silver Order and the oppression of mageborn responsible for limiting her potential to help the world and solve the issues of Drakkenheim. It may be possible for characters to convince the Academy to set aside their feud and have Ryan Greymere join once more. Ultimately, she would most like to be elected Archmage of Drakkenheim, but she might also collaborate with Eldrick Runeweaver. In either case, she proves to be a valuable asset, and her research and inventions could greatly advance the Academy's goals. Unfortunately, Ryan Greymere's fierce political opinions may complicate attempts to have the Amethyst Academy collaborate with other factions.
> 
> **Crafting Hazewalker Plate.** Building a suit of [Hazewalker Plate](Mechanics/items/hazewalker-plate-dodk.md) requires magically-enchanted smithing tools and a well-equipped arcane forge (such facilities can only be found within the Inscrutable Tower or other distant Amethyst Academy strongholds). It takes thirty days of work by a character who knows the schematics and can cast spells of 7th level or higher. The recipe calls for one delerium geode, 10,000 gp in alchemical reagents, and five ingots of refined meteoric iron in addition to enough conventional steel and materials for making either half-plate or plate. Ryan Greymere can craft a suit given facilities and materials, as can the Amethyst Academy.

## Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral

Saint Vitruvio was a mighty paladin of the Sacred Flame, the patron saint of Drakkenheim. Along with the ancient gold dragon Argonath, this righteous warrior saved Drakkenheim from a marauding army led by chromatic dragons that descended upon Westemär from the eastern vale centuries ago. Argonath gave their life in that battle, and Saint Vitruvio subsequently died slaying the half-dragon warlock behind the terrible scourge. Their bones and equipment have been kept as holy relics since, as Saint Vitruvio prophesied the gold dragon could be resurrected should Drakkenheim ever fall to darkness.

This gargantuan Cathedral of the Sacred Flame was built to house their remains. However, it is a relatively recent construction, only completed a little over a century ago to replace another large chapel that was torn down during the expansion of the city walls. Long before, the site was home to several crypts and crematory gardens, and the dead are still interred in the catacombs below the contemporary building. Following its completion, worshippers would travel for miles around to make prayers and offerings to the Sacred Flame here. After the meteor fell, these hallowed halls became a charnel house - the lair of the monstrous [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/098-06-015.cathedral.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, the player characters must spearhead an assault or infiltration into Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral, where they will face off against a terrifying garmyr warband. Then characters may explore the catacombs below to recover the relics within. The cathedral is one place that can bring all the factions together, but in the aftermath their disagreements blossom into open conflict.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Reclaim the Cathedral

Once characters have secured passage through a city gate, obtained at least one Seal of Drakkenheim, claimed the clocktower, and otherwise proven their competence and trustworthiness to either the Hooded Lanterns, the Silver Order, the Followers of the Falling Fire, or the Queen of Thieves, they are approached by a faction leader about leading an assault on the cathedral.

- For the Followers of the Falling Fire and the Silver Order, the cathedral is an important spiritual landmark. Not only are many important holy relics kept here, but also the magical brazier of the Sacred Flame could be re-ignited. Its protective aura might even hold back the Haze, at least around the cathedral.  
- Both the Queen of Thieves and the Hooded Lanterns wish to access the House von Kessel vaults located beneath the cathedral. This important archive may include copies of the king's will or other documents outlining the line of succession, and possibly other political secrets.  
- Finally, the [High Flamekeeper's Phylactery](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md) is believed to be lost here. As one of the six *Seals of Drakkenheim*, its recovery is essential if there is to one day be a new monarch... or someone wishes to use the power of the throne. Except for the Amethyst Academy, every faction wants to recover it.  
- The Amethyst Academy doesn't have a personal interest in recovering the cathedral. However, they may throw their support behind one of the other factions to garner favour with them later.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/099-06-016.mutation.webp#center)

### Interactions

A direct attack by the player characters alone is likely folly, so they should seek aid from the factions to defeat the Lord of the Feast.

#### Faction Alliance

Many factions can accomplish key objectives at the cathedral, which the characters can use to facilitate cooperation between them. This is one of the few moments in the campaign where all the factions are willing to pool their resources and work together with the player characters, so long as the following conditions are met by the characters:

- Demonstrated their trustworthiness and full loyalty to the faction's ideals and goals.  
- Acquired at least one *Seal of Drakkenheim*.  
- Secured the clocktower and Temple Gate.  
- Created an alliance with two other factions.  

The factions must keep a reserve force and a garrison for their current holdings, so each can only work with a few strike teams for this operation. Plus, large numbers of people moving in the city will attract more monsters, and quickly. They propose an assault mission by the player characters supported by a handful of faction strike teams.

- [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) and [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) are both willing to personally join the battle, and the other factions offer up boons in advance to help the characters.  
- The Inner City is filled with monsters, so moving material, troops, or large traps into the city over time is difficult and limited to what individual people can carry and set up in the field.  
- Once the cathedral is taken, the factions will post troops there on rotating shifts to defend it, but this will leave their forces stretched quite thin as a result.  

#### Planning the Attack

The player characters should be instrumental in planning the attack on the cathedral and devising a way to bring down the Lord of the Feast with the faction leaders. A decisive blow must be struck. The factions can't fight a battle of attrition in the streets or hold ground in the city because their troops will quickly become contaminated. The factions can provide a few doses of [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md) or cast [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) to heal an individual strike team, but none of the factions can afford to do this en masse.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/100-06-017.contaminated-hand.webp#center)

- The best intelligence and scouting reports the factions have indicates that the garmyr number in the hundreds, perhaps even as many as two thousand. While slaying the Lord of the Feast won't suddenly cause the garmyr to disappear, it should break any cohesion between the warbands.  
- If the characters are having trouble coming up with a plan, one of the faction leaders might suggest trying to draw out the Lord of the Feast with bait of some kind. Then, faction strike teams can lure away the bulk of the garmyr with a diversion, while the player characters take down the Lord of the Feast (possibly with a faction leader). Embrace your player's creativity in coming up with what might be suitable bait and what might be a good diversion!  

#### Lord of the Feast

Game statistics for this monstrous creature can be found in [Appendix A](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md).

- **Personality Trait.** I live for the hunt, and enjoy nothing more than fresh meat.  
- **Ideal.** It is the right of the strong to consume the weak.  
- **Bond.** Drakkenheim is the perfect hunting ground for an alpha predator such as myself.  
- **Flaw.** I am gripped with bloodlust that only subsides when I rest in the cathedral.

#### Cathedral Plaza

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Broad cobblestone streets wrap around an immense baroque cathedral in this august square. The structure dominates the plaza, completely dwarfing the nearby buildings with a two-hundred-fifty-foot-tall spired central dome that looms large over the gently sloping terracotta rooftops of the surrounding townhouses. The main dome is flanked by four stocky towers meticulously decorated with religious iconography and angelic sculptures. Between each are semicircular apses lined with stained glass windows fifty feet high, thus the building has a roughly square footprint. The outer facade has rows of alcoves containing life-size statues of valiant paladins and devoted clerics. Broad steps lead up to the columned entrance portico where a massive rose window rests above three sets of golden double doors embossed with heavenly visages.
> 
> Splayed out before the majestic building is a sprawling and ramshackle camp of makeshift hovels, smoking pyres, and improvised barricades. Tall wooden stakes are driven into the ground along the streets, displaying macabre trophies of bones, ribcages, skulls, and body parts. Guttural yelps and furious howls echo down the streets, and the overpowering scent of decaying offal, feces, and wet animal fur wafts about the haze-filled courtyard.
^48a

- 70 (`20d6`) [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and 14 (`4d6`) [worgs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md) devour their latest kills in the encampment.  

#### Cathedral Interior

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio houses a vast interior space. A monumental rotunda topped with a two-hundred-fifty-foot-high dome forms the central sanctuary where the Brazier of the Sacred Flame is set. The ribbed roof features an elaborate fresco depicting an angelic host descending from on high, lifting the wretched and the lost towards a divine light symbolized by a blazing sun. A row of stout yawning windows rings the base of the dome, bordered by multifaceted mirrors that create angular beams of light leaving spotlights on the floor and walls around the central altar.
> 
> Four halls extend in each cardinal direction like wheel spokes from the rotunda. Colossal marble columns decorated with cherubs line the aisles down each and support high vaulted ceilings one hundred twenty feet overhead. Murals upon the ceilings of the naves and aisles depict scenes of saints, angels, and martyrs performing righteous acts of mercy, compassion, and sacrifice. Each hall ends in a semicircular apse set with arched stained glass windows fifty feet high, except the southern hall that serves as the main entrance, above which is a rose window.
> 
> Unnatural hues from outside flood this once holy place through the many windows, and cast the chambers in an unsettling and otherworldly pallor. The sanctuary has been defiled by the countless carcasses of the garmyr's many slaughters. Broken bones and severed limbs are strewn about carpets of stretched skin and furry hide. Debris and refuse are caked into the cracks and crevices, vibrant red blood smears the floors and walls. Flensing blades, barbed chains, and meat hooks dangle from the torch sconces. Unrecognizable forms of hanging meat decorate the elaborate chandeliers above. At the heart of the cathedral is a tiered platform upon which rests a five-foot-wide granite brazier. Instead of a glorious golden flame, piled within is a mountain of blood-soaked skulls.

- During the day, the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) rests here with 14 (`4d6`) garmyr [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md), and 10 (`3d6`) [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md). The great beast hunts nightly from dusk till dawn when only 7 (`2d6`) [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md), and 4 (`1d6`) [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md) remain behind.  
- A mutated garmyr [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) wearing the tattered robes of a Flamekeeper conducts blasphemous rites before the altar of skulls. It carries the [High Flamekeeper's Phylactery](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md).  

##### Catacomb Passages

Two arched doorways with oak doors open to staircases that descend down into the cathedral catacombs. Both doors are brightly illuminated by beams of light created by the reflecting mirrors in the dome above.

#### Sidechambers

Small groups of garmyr have claimed these rooms as their own, and each is now in a state of disarray and gore.

##### Bell Towers

The central dome of Saint Vitruvio's is anchored by four great bell towers. The lower floors are great galleries where statues and artworks are displayed, with the belfrys accessed by narrow staircases and ladders.

##### Chandlery

This western side room is a workshop for making the many candles, holy oils, and flammable fluids used in the holy ceremonies of the Sacred Flame.

##### Sacristy

These eastern rooms are where the Flamekeepers donned their vestments, prepared for their sermons, conducted personal meetings, and meditated privately. A small loft houses a few cots used by the nightkeepers, but most of the clergy lived at Saint Selina's Monastery.

##### Vestibules

Since the cathedral could be packed with thousands of worshippers on high holy days, these additional entrances helped ensure the flood of people could easily enter and exit.

### Cathedral Catacombs

Beneath the cathedral dome lies an ancient burial crypt for former paladins and Flamekeepers who pledged their life in service to the Sacred Flame. The Lord of the Feast and his warpack leave these hallowed halls abandoned and forgotten, instead seeking fresh meat in the city ruins.

#### Light Beam Puzzle

The treasures of the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio are sealed behind warded doors of stone, which slide open only when a beam of heavenly light is shone into the aperture lenses upon them. A beam of light originates above each of the Ascendant Archangel statues (detailed below), then characters must direct the beams down the halls by bouncing the light from mirrored shields found throughout the catacombs. Solving the puzzle requires placing the varying numbers of shields in specific positions then facing them in different directions to open the doors.

- The locations marked 'X' on the map indicate the approximate position where a character can hold a shield to bounce the beams, which then reflects at a ninety-degree angle towards another glyph in line with the previous glyph (think "connect the dots"). Characters can hold the shields themselves or prop them up with objects if needed.  

##### Aperture Doors

These stone doors are eighteen inches thick and made of heavy granite. There are no seams, hinges, handles, or locks upon these doors save an embedded bronze aperture set with a thick glass lens at the centre. Peering through provides a distorted view of the chamber beyond. Engravings on each door depict resolute paladins and righteous heroes of the Sacred Flame.

- The magically warded doors are immune to all damage, and magic can't alter their forms.  
- A door slides open once a Heavenly Beam (see below) is shone into the aperture, and remains open for eight hours thereafter.  

##### Heavenly Beams

Light is collected above the cathedral dome and shines down upon the Ascendant Archangels, where it becomes a clearly visible magical beam of heavenly light. These beams do not harm creatures or damage objects, and travel in straight lines. They can only be reflected off mirrored shields found in the crypts or those borne by the Ascendant Archangels. Any other reflective surface causes the beams to fizzle out.

##### Mirrored Shields

Six silver shields with brilliant reflective surfaces are hidden throughout the catacombs. Each weighs twenty pounds and is entirely impractical for actual defense, and don't have any other properties beyond reflecting the heavenly beams. Either side of the shield can reflect the heavenly beams, obeying the laws of reflection, although solving the puzzles in the crypt only requires the beams be bounced at hard ninety-degree angles.

##### Holy Wards

[Hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) spells ward the House von Kessel vault, the tomb of Saint Vitruvio, the Vault of Ignacious, and Argonath's Rest. Creatures can't teleport into these areas.

#### Alcoves of the Ascendant Archangels

Descending either set of stairs from the cathedral sanctuary above leads to similar passageways:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stairs descend into a short corridor with a semicircular alcove at one end. The opposite way leads to a crossed intersection of arched passageways heading in each cardinal direction. Inside the alcove is a magnificent ten-foot-tall marble statue of an angelic figure set upon a pedestal. The angel holds a weapon in one hand, and in the other bears a round silver shield polished to a mirror-like sheen. A column of light shines down from a hole in the ceiling above, illuminating the sculpture in a beam of heavenly light.
^49a

- The statues depict the Archangels Gabrielle (east alcove) and Michael (west), who hold a spear and sword respectively. Characters proficient in the [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion) skill automatically recognize them; they are the angels who guided Saint Tarna down the path of a paladin.  
- The shields are magically secured to each statue. However, the angels' arms are articulated. A character can use an action to move and rotate the shield into a forty five degree angle in relation to the floor, which sends the beam of heavenly light straight down the passageway directly away from the alcoves.  
- Characters can place a mirrored shield in the intersection to bounce light north or south.  
- An inscription on each statue reads "The light opens the way of truth."  

#### [1-3] Tombs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> These long rooms are lined with ancient stone slabs laid out with the mummified remains of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame, the bodies simply adorned with a single trinket or weapons from their former lives. Each clutches a holy symbol in their hands, and has smooth stones placed upon their eyes. Surrounding each stone platform are dozens of candles in various shapes and sizes. The tombs here are untouched and covered in thick dust. The stone slab floor and low ceilings paired with the many tombs and niches lined with skulls ever watching those who enter make even these large and spacious rooms feel claustrophobic and unsettling.
^49c

##### Mummified Clergy

Each chamber houses the mummified remains of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame. Although the dead are normally cremated, the faithful believe these blessed souls may one day return to their earthly bodies in a desperate time when the Sacred Flame enact its will through corporeal vessels. Their bodies are wrapped in linen cloth, and dressed with bits of clothing, armour, or weapons they used in life. Inscriptions, tapestries, and painted murals decorate each sarcophagus niche, telling the life and deeds of the dead. Finally, 10 (`3d6`) candles are arranged around each sarcophagus. A holy rite allows the candles to remain lit eternally without being consumed, but they can be doused as normal.

- Each is a [mummy](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) that lies in state. Last rites performed over them decades ago hold back the reanimating magic of the Haze. They do not rise unless their remains or possessions are disturbed, in which case the nearby candles snuff out, and they attack as unhinged and violent undead. They have the following additional trait:  
- ***Rejuvenation*.** If the mummy is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in ten minutes, unless its remains are placed upon the stone slab, surrounded with lit candles, sprinkled with holy water, and a short prayer uttered over it, or a [gentle repose](Mechanics/spells/gentle-repose.md) or [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) is cast upon its remains.  
- ***Treasure*.** Each mummy has gemstones placed over their eye sockets worth 100 gp each. They also clutch a gold or silver holy symbol of the Sacred Flame worth 50 gp.  

#### [1] Western Tombs

The candles of this great hall are lit with ever-burning flames that cause a dance of dim light across the various tombs and niches throughout. Shadows cast upon the walls and floor flitter with an ambience of warmth and welcome.

- The door to this chamber opens immediately when the arms of Michael in the west Ascendant Archangel alcove are switched to a forty-five-degree angle.  
- The [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) here remain dormant unless disturbed.  
- One of the niches is empty, but there is a small circular aperture filled with glass on the wall. Bouncing light into it from a mirrored shield causes the wall to slide open into a dusty room, which contains `1d4` rare [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) from the cleric spell list and another mirrored shield.  

#### [2] Southwest Tombs

The candles of this hall have all gone out, casting the room in a cold darkness. The deafening silence of the hall of dead is eerie. Upon one of the ancient tombs lies a shining shield that just catches the light drifting down from the stairs. The shield is clutched in the hands of the mummified remains of a great saint.

- Opening the aperture door to this chamber requires using one mirror shield; bouncing light from the west Ascendant Archangel alcove, placed at the west intersection.  
- All the candles in this tomb have gone out, and the [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) interred here are mad. They rise and attack if any enter the chamber, and the mirrored shield clatters to the ground.  
- The mummies must be laid to rest properly to keep them from rising again (see above).  

#### [3] Eastern Tombs

Several of the candles in this room have gone out except for three of the stone slabs still illuminated in the dim light. At the back of the room a statue of a great Flamekeeper sits clutching a shining shield that reflects the candlelight of the room.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/106-06-019.crystal.webp#center)

- The door to this chamber opens immediately when the arms of Gabrielle in the east Ascendant Archangel alcove are switched to a forty-five-degree angle.  
- The [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) rise and attack if someone takes the mirrored shield, except the three with candles still lit around them who remain in state.  

#### [4] Founder's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This semicircular room is lined with rows upon rows of niches each with a single skull looking out into the centre of the room. A burning brazier rests in the middle that casts a soft glow highlighting the semi-precious stones or coins placed in the eye sockets of each of the skulls. Along the flat wall of the chamber are several rows of shelves that lie between two stone-carved archways that frame a portion of stone wall with nothing on it. The shelves are lined with small statues of various animals including a brass toad, a copper cat, a silver bird, an ivory ox, a granit bear, a gold horse, and an iron eagle.
> 
> The brazier within this chamber has an inscription carved into the stone around its base that reads "The bodies of our first Flamekeepers rest here under the watchful gaze of the dead. Ere a living soul should seek their guiding light, know that one who sees with clear eyes may open the way. Take up their shining truth with silver wings."
^4a2

- There is one skull that has no gems placed in its eyes. A small switch within the left eye socket causes the wall of the right archway to slide open.  
- A switch on the bottom of the silver bird statue causes the left archway to open.  
- Within each open alcove is a stone slab with a gloriously decorated body adorned with holy symbols and burning candles. Each clutches a shimmering mirror shield.  
- The aperture door in this chamber can be opened using a single shield and bouncing the light from the east Ascendant Archangel alcove at the east intersection.  

#### [5] Pool of the Mourning Angel

This circular room has a domed roof painted with frescoes of knights carrying holy flames upon their hands and marching in a spiraling formation towards a central glowing light. A large marble font of water rests within the centre of this room with a tragic looking statue perched on the far end. Water flows from the statue's eyes, down its face, falling gently into the pool below.

This statue depicts an angelic man looking up to the heavens with a look of sorrowful anguish upon his crying face. His hands rest an inch above the water, fingers curled up as if he begs "why!" to the heavens. Along the base of the fountain are four evenly spaced iron handles.

- A mirror shield can be placed upon the statue's hands, which can be rotated by grabbing the iron handles under the water. The light can then be reflected into the Scriptorium.  

#### [6] Scriptorium

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The scriptorium is a large square room lined with wooden shelves from floor to ceiling. The shelves are overflowing with assorted texts, papers, scrolls, and documents all loosely organized by date. In the middle of the room are four large wooden tables flanked by rows of wooden stools. Several old tomes and scrolls lay upon the tables along with inkwells and quills. Ink stains the tables and one of the inkwells has toppled over causing the ink to spill to the floor and run through the cracks within the stone.
^4a5

- The documents all appear to be writings of holy texts, copies of famous literary works and historical stories of importance to the Sacred Flame.  
- Amongst the shelves are `2d6` rare [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) from the cleric spell list, including a *scroll* of [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md).  
- Floating within the room is a [wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) and 2 (`1d4`) [warp witches](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warp-witch-dodk.md).  
- Opening the Vault of Ignacious requires all six mirror shields to direct both heavenly beams into the statue. Three are placed on each side.  

#### [7] House von Kessel Vault

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two long alcoves meet a small passage at the intersection of this L-shaped chamber. At the ends are large stone statues of armoured guardians each holding a kite shield before them. A large stone plaque is polished to a mirror sheen between them, opposing a narrow passage that ends in a bas-relief carving of two dragons rampant, each with an aperture lens in their mouth.
^4a7

- Opening the vault requires bouncing light from the east intersection, then bouncing the light *upwards* at the bottom of the shaft, then bouncing it east again at the top of the shaft. Since the shield would need to be positioned in midair, it's up to the characters to come up with a clever way to do this - but they'll need three mirror shields however they do it.  
- ***Lineage Records*.** This family tree with written descriptions of each person, marriage agreements, dowries, and adoption decrees is magically preserved and bears royal seals.  
- ***The Royal Will*.** What it says is up to you, but it could describe Ulrich IV's intentions if he were to die without a known heir.  
- ***Blood Phylacteries*.** This minor magical item is a glass vial that keeps the blood stored within preserved indefinitely. Once sealed, the stopper holds celestial runes naming the person whose blood is contained within, and can only be opened by the use of [universal solvent](Mechanics/items/universal-solvent.md). If a creature who is a direct blood relative holds the vial, the vial glows and runes appear within describing the nature of their relation (parent and child, siblings, cousins, ect.).  
- Vials of blood taken from Ulrich IV and his last six predecessors are kept here.

> Blessed is the lair of Ignacius! A wonderful gift for an impressive warrior.

#### [8] Vault of Ignacious

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This circular vaulted chamber is ribbed with strange bronze pipes and niches filled with candles. Hovering in place above a central dias in a column of flame is a glimmering silver blade. The chamber is otherwise unadorned, but filled with nearly blinding light and sweltering heat from the crackling flames.
^4a9

- This sword is [Ignacious, the Sword of Burning Truth](Mechanics/items/ignacious-the-sword-of-burning-truth-dodk.md). Whoever grips this blade is judged by the sword, which only accepts a righteous wielder.  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > Those who take up the blade and are unworthy: "Thou art rough in spirit and brittle in soul, knave. Though perhaps if you prove to me your might, I shall take your coal-heart and iron limbs and temper them into a righteous instrument of blazing steel!"  
    ^4aa  
- The column of flame then collapses into a burning [deva](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) wielding the blade, who challenges the characters to battle. Ignacious will allow itself to be wielded by any who defeat the deva, believing it can turn them to the cause of righteousness.  

#### [9] Tomb of Saint Vitruvio

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A marble colonnade forms a narrow aisle around this circular chamber, each pillar set with a lighted torch. Murals upon the walls depict the deeds and battles of a valiant paladin, and a life-sized statue of the man stands upon a circular podium in the centre of the room.
> 
> He is clad in plate armour and wears a resplendent helm; a shield upon his pack, sword strapped to his belt, a sceptre at his side, and a phylactery around his neck. His outstretched arms extend fully to his sides, and his palms face outwards. Cavities in the statue at the right thigh, jaw, and within several knuckles hold the few remaining bones of Saint Vitruvio, each etched with delicate prayers. Glass spheres rest in the statue's eye sockets, and within the palms of the statue's hands are stigmata-like holes, each filled with a small lens. Hundreds of lit candles are set around the statue and about the room, and a mirrored shield is fixed on the wall to the south.
^4ac

- Accessing Saint Vitruvio's Tomb requires using two mirror shields to bounce light at the intersections, but can be done from either the east or west side.  
- Upon the wall is a golden shield. Behind the shield is a large circular aperture filled with glass. Surrounding it is a moulding depicting Saint Vitruvio riding upon Argonath.  
- Vitruvio's statue can be rotated, but also lowered and raised by pushing on it as an action. It can be moved into a position such that its palms are in line with the apertures on the doors, and its eyes are in line with the mirrored shield on the south wall.  
- If the heavenly beams of light from both Ascendant Archangel alcoves are reflected into the lenses on both of the statue's hands at the same time, a single thick beam shoots from the statue's eyes. The resulting beam strikes the aperture on the south wall, which then rumbles open revealing a wide spiral staircase leading to Argonath's Rest. Accomplishing this requires four mirror shields, one positioned at each intersection.  

#### [10] Argonath's Rest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The spiral staircase descends down a wide stone chimney into the earth, and eventually opens into a great natural cavern. Suffocating sulphurous-smelling vapours saturate the chamber. Resting in a pool of bubbling oil are the ancient remains of a colossal dragon. The great golden plates of its armoured scales still cling to its hulking skeletal remains, though the rest of its flesh has long since decomposed.
^4ae

- A [forbiddance](Mechanics/spells/forbiddance.md) spell wards this chamber; creatures can't teleport into the area.  
- An inscription reads: *"This was my brother in battle, Argonath. Let none disturb his deserved rest unless great darkness engulfs Drakkenheim at the end of days."*  
- Carrying an open flame in this chamber is a *very* bad idea.  
- These are the bones of Argonath, an [ancient gold dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon.md). The dragon can be restored to life by casting [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md) using a spell slot and providing the *Diamond of Mount Kadath* or the *pristine delerium geode* as a material component. Thereafter, the dragon slumbers here unless commanded by one who wields all the relics of Saint Vitruvio.  
- The chimney by the staircase meets the cathedral floor above. If Argonath is resurrected, he exits this chamber by flying up the chimney and bursting through the floor.

> Slaying the Lord of the Feast and conquering the cathedral provokes an immediate response from all the factions.

> 
> - Eldrick Runeweaver sends his [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md), his [homunculus](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/homunculus.md), and River. They bring a [potion of invisibility](Mechanics/items/potion-of-invisibility.md) and a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md), and escape immediately if conflict breaks out.  
> - The Queen of Thieves sends a decoy, controlled via [dominate person](Mechanics/spells/dominate-person.md). This patsy is disguised both physically *and* using a [seeming](Mechanics/spells/seeming.md) spell, and the Queen of Thieves directly controls this unfortunate captive and makes them behave as if they were actually her in person. She coordinates with her spies and assassins to launch an assassination strike against a vulnerable faction leader or the player characters. Blackjack Mel does not attend, however.  
> - Elias Drexel, Theodore Marshal, and Lucretia Mathias arrive with a large contingent of their own faction troops nearby, ready to storm the cathedral if violence breaks out.  
> 
> All the faction leaders are keenly aware that violence could break out at any moment, but in fact, none of them are actually willing to *start* a fight here. During the discussion, faction leaders should bring up the following key questions:
> 
> - What are the true motives of the player characters? Whose side are they on, really?  
> - Which faction should control the cathedral?  
> - What will be done about the royal documents?  
> - Who will hold any *Seals of Drakkenheim* discovered so far? Who should rule Drakkenheim?  
> - How should delerium be used?  
> 
> During this meeting, the roleplaying traits of the factions, their goals, and the faction leaders should be fully presented. Draw bright lines in the conflict, and don't be afraid to put the characters on the spot: each faction leader should address each player character directly at least once with a difficult question of some kind.
> 
> **.** **Brutal Betrayal (Optional).** If the player characters have greatly antagonized one of the factions before this meeting, that faction either secretly mobilizes several elite strike teams on standby or plants powerful explosives under the cathedral prior to the meeting. They also orchestrate an escape plan for their leader (which in the case of the Academy or the Queen of Thieves isn't needed since they are only present by proxy). During the meeting, the leader demands to be given either all of the Seals of Drakkenheim, the Relics of Saint Vitruvio, control of the cathedral, or any other insane ultimatum appropriate for the faction. If their demands aren't met, their forces attack or they detonate the explosives, which create a massive explosion akin to a [meteor swarm](Mechanics/spells/meteor-swarm.md) that fills the cathedral and collapses the roof and dome.
> 
> **Reigniting the Brazier.** Lucretia Mathias and Ophelia Reed both offer to reignite the *Brazier of the Sacred Flame* and reconsecrate the cathedral. This requires some ashes or bone fragments from a saint: either those of Saint Vitruvio himself or the gold dragon, Argonath, which can be recovered from the cathedral catacombs. If re-lit, the cathedral brazier fills the area with effects similar to [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) and [forbiddance](Mechanics/spells/forbiddance.md), and becomes a sanctuary in the city against the Haze where characters may rest normally.
> 
> If the cathedral was bombed, the brazier is destroyed and can't be reignited.
> 
> **Aftermath.** The cathedral remains hotly contested ground: the Followers of the Falling Fire and the Silver Order will try to take it from each other after these meetings regardless of how the negotiations turned out. If the Hooded Lanterns or the Queen of Thieves aren't able to gain the information in the House von Kessel vault, they'll launch counterstrikes as well to obtain them.
> 
> Any faction who holds onto the cathedral can establish a shaky safe haven there, but doing so stretches the faction's forces thin. Nevertheless, the player characters can use it as a base of operations. Ultimately, holding the cathedral for more than 14 (`4d6`) weeks proves untenable due to constant attrition, unless the player characters take action to drive out enemy factions and complete their allies' major objectives. By taking the cathedral the player characters have a major opportunity, but they must take advantage of it before it's too late.

## Slaughterstone Square

Slaughterstone Square is an important crossroads in Drakkenheim - the intersecting streets here lead north to Castle Drakken, east to King's Gate, south to a bridge crossing the Drann River, and west to Market Square Plaza. Centuries ago the square was the core of the Old Town, home to the main marketplace and simply known as Flagstone Square. As the city grew it became a civic centre and eventually, a place for public executions. Its present moniker has never been more appropriate. The [Executioner](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/executioner-dodk.md) still occupies the plaza: a hulking clockwork knight designed to mete out death sentences. Contaminated by the Haze, the beserk machine now ferociously eviscerates any who dare pass through Slaughterstone Square.

### Overview

Slaughterstone Square lies above the cistern, so we recommend you read this section first if your characters are seeking that location.

#### Adventure Hooks

Rumour claims a vast collection of treasure and magic items may be found here, left behind by the Executioner's countless victims. Many adventurers make the fatal last mistake of approaching Slaughterstone Square for this reason alone. However, your characters may simply happen upon this forsaken place by accident or on a foolish lark. Alternatively, some bold characters may be travelling through the square to reach the cistern, or possibly arrived via the smuggler's passage connected to the Black Ivory Inn.

#### A Deadly Threat

No matter why they came here, your characters should probably run. The Executioner is not a foe to be defeated, but rather an obstacle to be avoided (or perhaps an asset to use should the opportunity emerge to lure an unsuspecting foe here!). It is a reminder of the callous and uncontrollable dangers present in Drakkenheim. Embrace clever solutions your characters invent to escape or bypass this threat, but should your players engage the Executioner directly in combat, *do not pull any punches*. They have made an incredibly foolish mistake by confronting a well-telegraphed deathtrap, and should be served their just desserts!

> [!quote] A quote from Veo Sjena

> When planning a trip to Slaughterstone Square, always remember: you dont have to outrun the Executioner, just your slowest party member...

### Area Details

#### Slaughterstone Square

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Slaughterstone Square is a large octagonal plaza paved with broad flagstones with a squat, bowl-shaped granite fountain thirty feet wide and five feet tall at its centre. The tightly-packed surrounding townhouses rise up three storeys to high-steepled rooftops with wrought-iron cresting. Many feature narrow balconies and tall dour-looking windows on their front facades overlooking the square.
> 
> The building composition resembles stern faces held in silent judgement, as if all who look upon them are found wanting. Pools of coagulated blood stain the streets around several mangled corpses.
^4bb

- The [Executioner](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/executioner-dodk.md) stands utterly motionless beside the fountain, blood dripping from its axe.  
- It jolts to life and immediately charges any creature who attacks, casts a spell, or approaches within one hundred twenty feet of it. It attacks indiscriminately, and only pursues creatures beyond the square if it continues to be attacked.  
- The Executioner has formed a bizarre habit for gathering the bodies of its slain victims and hurling their remains into the fountain. Blood and body parts slosh around the fountain, and then are deposited into the cistern.  
- The fountain collects rainwater in a flowing spiral that drains into a five-foot diameter hole at the centre. The hole leads directly into the cistern below, where the water fills up the reservoir. There was once a wrought-iron grate covering the hole, but only a few protruding pieces of sharp iron are left there now.  
- Amongst the few corpses the Executioner hasn't yet dropped into the square may be found damaged adventuring equipment and weapons. If you wish, `1d6` uncommon *potions* and an uncommon magic item of your choice may be found here.  
- A heavy sewer cover beside the fountain can be lifted from this side with an action, proper leverage and a DC 20 Strength check. It opens to a stairway into the Old Town Cistern.

#### Magistrate's Court

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The largest building in Slaughterstone Square is a somber and formal-looking manor house three storeys tall that takes up the entire block. Pointed windows with broken glass line each floor. Broad stone steps lead up to the double doors entrance, above which hang banners bearing the crest of the city itself.
^4bd

- This building served as both a courthouse and offices for the civilian functionaries such as the Lord Mayor and the city council. Many public records are housed in the archives here, so characters on a personal quest looking for information about people who lived in Drakkenheim could find such documentation here.
