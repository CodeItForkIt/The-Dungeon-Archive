# Chapter 6: Outside the Walls
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 74* 

All manner of treasure-seekers have made their fortunes and met their fates in the Outer City. These crumbling ruins surround the city walls like huddled masses desperate for shelter. Describe the abandoned feeling of the ruined Outer City as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Travelling down the decrepit thoroughfares of Drakkenheim, you pass several buildings which have completely collapsed into rubble. Those which still stand are little more than condemned wretches teetering upon the brink of ruin. A rare few are undamaged, but still bear obvious signs of disuse and exposure: shattered windows, peeling paint, doors rotted off the hinges, and wet sagging rooftops. The cracked cobblestones are littered with abandoned refuse; broken wagons, litter, and an occasional bloodstain or scattered bones. Here and there, tiny motes of octarine glint within the light mist which hangs over the streets. For now, the streets are cold and deadly quiet.

## Overview

The locations in the Outer City make ideal early explorations into Drakkenheim. However, characters who have not reached at least 3rd level may find these locations quite challenging. The party need not visit every location detailed herein, but those who do may reach up to 6th level exploring the Outer City. Characters may visit these locations in any order, but the "Rat's Nest" and the "Chapel of Saint Brenna" are ideal locations to begin.

### Adventure Hooks

Each location in this section describes a variety of adventure hooks you can use to prompt characters to explore the site: most involve one of the faction lieutenants approaching the party. See "Making Contact with the Factions" in Chapter 4: Emberwood Village for a summary of the faction lieutenants and where they can be found within the town.

### City Walls and Gates

The party should explore the Outer City before taking on the Inner City. Nevertheless, if characters are determined to make their way into the Inner City, they can certainly try! Should the party approach any of the city gates or attempt to scale the city walls, consult Chapter 7 "Inside the Walls of Drakkenheim".

Once characters have gained experience exploring the ruins and developed a relationship with one or more of the factions, they'll be ready to tackle the Walls of Drakkenheim and begin exploring the Inner City locations (detailed in chapter 7).

## Black Ivory Inn

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/045-05-001.black-ivory-inn.webp#center)

> [!quote] A quote from Blackjack Mel  
> 
> Listen, I know a guy, my cousin Mike used to run a smugglers tunnel underneath an old inn on the outskirts of town, leads ya right into the city. Now, I hear some people saying the old Black Ivory place is up and running again? Maybe worth seeing if that smugglers tunnel is still operational for an easy way in and out of the city!

The Black Ivory Inn stands utterly pristine; apparently spared from the ravages of the meteor. Warm light, sweet-smelling wine, mirthful laughter, and stunningly beautiful piano melodies emanate from within and waft through the ruined streets nearby. However, the legendary music hall and hotel is the site of a bizarre arcane anomaly that has warped the fabric of time and space. Until the malignant abomination anchoring this twisted magic is destroyed, visitors to the Black Ivory Inn are trapped within a time loop: doomed to forever play out the last four hours and thirty-three minutes before the meteor struck.

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe  
> 
> Magic is hard to control at the best of times. Sometimes you wish you could throw fire, and you end up setting yourself on fire. I know from experience. Look at this scar... arcane anomaly.

### Overview

In this adventure, the characters must escape the time-cursed Black Ivory Inn with their lives and sanity intact. They may be drawn in by the mysterious melody coming from the disturbingly normal looking building, or they might seek out the Black Ivory Inn deliberately to find a missing contact or the smugglers passage rumoured to run underneath the hotel.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### A Haunting Melody

While travelling through Kingside, the player characters may hear piano music in the air, and the sounds of mirthful laughter. Following the music leads them to a pristine building, spared from the ravages of time and the meteor itself. Alternately the characters may hear about the inn and its music from a rumour, and may choose to investigate it on their own accord.

##### The Smuggler's Passage

In its heyday, the Black Ivory Inn was a notable speakeasy known for having an excellent smuggler's passage to move illegal goods into Drakkenheim under the walls. If this passage can be secured it may prove useful for navigating the more dangerous areas of the city.

##### Missing Prophet

A missing priest of the Falling Fire was sent to aid and recruit the rumoured people staying at the Inn, but has not returned. The party is asked to go investigate this disappearance and, if possible, bring the priest back to his people.

> [!quote] A quote from Pluto Jackson  
> 
> Magic itself is unpredictable, not wielded but conjured with surprise. It all looks as wild as a boar.

### Interactions

The time loop is the result of a curious interaction between the Haze and a peculiarly worded [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md).

#### Time Loop

A renowned musician performed here named Miss Charlotte. In her youth, Charlotte encountered an extraplanar entity that granted her a single [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md). Her wish was to be the greatest living pianist of all time. However, Miss Charlotte was already an unparalleled musician. Instead of improving her talents, her wish granted her immortality by binding her life and talents to her piano, not unlike the relationship between a lich and its phylactery. As a result, she would perpetually remain the greatest living piano player *of all time*, so long as her piano remained intact.

Miss Charlotte was impaled by a delerium crystal during the destruction of Drakkenheim. She would have died if not for her wish. Caught between life and death, Miss Charlotte's wish has been twisted by the magic of the Haze, throwing the entire Black Ivory Inn into a temporal pocket that traps anyone who enters. Her body was transformed into a [protean abomination](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md), which now lurks below the temporal reflection of the Black Ivory Inn. Her mind projects a simulacrum of her original form that can continue playing her piano for all time.

#### Becoming Trapped

A character becomes trapped in the time loop the moment they wholly step inside the Black Ivory Inn. There is no saving throw.

- Trapped creatures cannot perceive or interact with creatures and objects outside the Black Ivory Inn. This effect begins 10 (`3d6`) minutes after the creature becomes trapped. During this period, victims can still perceive and interact with creatures outside Black Ivory Inn, but such creatures and objects appear hazy and faded before disappearing entirely. After this point, when a trapped creature looks outside the Black Ivory Inn, they see a time-lost version of Drakkenheim instead of the present-day ruins.  
- Characters trapped within the time loop are visible to outsiders only while they remain inside the Black Ivory Inn; they can't be perceived otherwise.  

#### Effects of the Time Loop

The loop itself behaves like a pocket dimension or demiplane. The anomaly constantly plays out the last four hours and thirty-three minutes before the meteor struck in a time loop capturing the events from 3:40 PM to 8:13 PM on September 16th.

- Characters are instantly killed by the meteor at the end of each loop at 8:13 PM.  
- After the death or incapacitation of the entire party (whether at the end of the loop or by some other means) they awaken again at 3:40 PM.  
- The characters are restored to full hit points and receive the benefits of a long rest. Any bodily damage is restored, no matter how severe. The characters retain whichever items were in their possession the moment they entered the Black Ivory Inn, but lose any items or equipment they picked up since then. As such, items that characters brought with them but used during the previous loop are restored!  
- Characters who consumed any food or drink within the Black Ivory Inn during the previous loop must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, they temporarily lose their awareness of being stuck in a time loop until reminded by someone else what has happened to them.  
- Each time the time loop repeats or the characters are killed, each character must succeed on a DC 5 Intelligence saving throw or gain a random form of indefinite of Drakkenheim Madness.  
- Time continues to pass for those outside the loop. A creature trapped in the loop for over a year of real-world time loses their memories and becomes bound to the loop forever. They die and crumble to dust if the loop ends, and then may only be restored via a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell.  

#### Escaping the Loop

A character may escape the loop via [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) or [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md), but teleportation spells directed outside the demiplane fail. Characters might also be able to convince Miss Charlotte to let them leave.

#### Breaking the Loop

The time loop ends if the [protean abomination](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md) and the **piano** are both destroyed. When this happens the Black Ivory Inn and its patrons slowly erode into black ash. All that are left behind are the characters, and the five other visitors (or their corpses, if they did not survive the final loop). Little else remains of the Black Ivory Inn save rubble and ruin - it now appears as it should for a building struck by a meteor. There is a path through the rubble to the Smuggler's Warehouse below. The debris can be cleared away to re-open the underground tunnel.

#### Key Events

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Miss Charlotte is the greatest pianist of all time."
^26c

- The time loop begins at 3:40 PM  
- [Miss Charlotte](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md) plays all afternoon into the evening.  
- At 7pm she takes a break from playing. She sits at the bar and chats with patrons, enjoying a glass of wine and a small meal for thirty minutes.  
- The meteor strikes at 8:13 PM, shortly after dusk. In this moment, a meteor chunk impales Miss Charlotte, no matter where she is located at that time.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> There is a wash of dust and ash, and you open your eyes to thunderous applause as Charlotte finishes her first set.
^26d

Once inside the Black Ivory Inn, characters see Drakkenheim as it was fifteen years ago, in the late afternoon of September 16, 1111.

#### Miss Charlotte

[Miss Charlotte](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md) is a willowy woman with slender limbs and delicate fingers. She wears a simple green gown, and keeps her hair tied in a bun behind her head. She gracefully plays the piano in an enraptured trance.

- **Ideal.** To play music is all I've ever wanted, it's all I've ever had, it's everything I'll ever need, and the only thing I have left. Please don't take that from me.  
- **Bond.** Artists ought to be free to share their gifts with the world. I admire any artist who has the same passion and skill for their craft as I do for mine.  
- **Flaw.** I cannot bear what has happened, and the truth fills me with rage and anger. Instead, I will surround myself with music and mirth until the end of time.  

Miss Charlotte and the piano are immune to all damage as long as the abomination has one hit point or more. In addition, as long as the abomination has at least one hit point, when Miss Charlotte fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

When Miss Charlotte plays a chord on the piano (as an action), the abomination rejuvenates with all its hit points.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I remember you... you caused a bit of trouble last time you were here. Just try to relax and enjoy the music."
^26f

#### Tavern Patrons

Most patrons encountered within the Black Ivory Inn are hopelessly lost and cannot comprehend their current predicament. They are dimly aware of what is going on, but have endured so much madness it has crushed their actual will. Tales about meteors and time loops are met with laughter or bewilderment, which quickly turns to outrage and disgust if the player characters pursue it. Even proof such as delerium shards or uncanny foreknowledge fails to rouse them from their stupor.

- There's roughly 35 (`10d6`) human [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) or [nobles](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) enjoying music, coffee, food, and accommodations at the Black Ivory Inn, with a staff of 7 (`2d6`) more [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) who work as cooks, porters, and housekeepers alongside the notable figures below.  
- These people are forever lost to the time loop, and die when it ends. They never leave the inn, nor have any recollection or understanding of the time loop.  
- The tavern patrons defend Miss Charlotte if she's attacked. They can't perceive the protean abomination.  

##### "Open" Mike Connolly

The owner of the Black Ivory Inn is a rotund human [scoundrel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) with blonde slicked back hair, a curly moustache and a set of round framed glasses, dressed in a red velvet coat. He is often found sitting close to the stage admiring the musicians. Though he knows about the illicit activities happening beneath his bar, he doesn't discuss the smuggler's tunnel openly with anyone he hasn't met before, but mentioning his young nephew Mel sparks his attention. Mike has the key to both the cellar doors and the smuggler's tunnel, which he keeps on a key ring on his belt.

##### Rogan Blum

The well-dressed bartender of the Black Ivory Inn is a human [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md). Rogan will listen to any tale of woe and regret from a paying customer, and his advice seems staggeringly insightful two or three drinks in.

##### Phifer Winters

A young human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) serves drinks and coffee with a warm smile and a friendly compliment. Though she's often too busy working to chat, she'll excitedly talk about her aspirations to one day sail the Diamond Sea and travel to distant lands.

##### Reginald Grimes

This human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) is approaching his seventies, but still cooks in the kitchen of the Black Ivory Inn. He takes great pride in his culinary work and is completely unable to tolerate criticism of his cooking. He deems each meal he makes a work of art.

#### Smuggler's Ring

A group of smugglers.

- 3 (`1d6`) [bandit captains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) and 14 (`4d6`) [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md).  

Captain Wicket is a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) who has an old pirate hat and blue coat on. He is holding a meeting for his men about the next job they are doing in the basement meeting room in the Black Ivory Inn. He has three trusted commanders and a gang of thieves who have come to meet him here. He has requested that no one disturb their meeting. Detailed below is his crew:

- Left Hand Lila: a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) with a hook for a right hand  
- Mr. Big: A gnome [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) with a devilish smirk and a knack for dramatic plans  
- Wind: an albino tiefling [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) with bright red eyes, black hair and huge horns  
- Ted Oats: a budding criminal with short black hair, eager for this job  
- Fred Oats: the twin brother of Ted with long black hair, defensive of his brother  

#### Trapped Visitors

There are five people who have become trapped here recently whom the characters' actions may jolt back into awareness. Though they have forgotten themselves, they can be roused from their stupor by reminding them of present events.

##### Osiris Chronolly

A long-bearded and purple-robed Amethyst Academy [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who came to the Black Ivory Inn following a long-lost rumour that the legendary musician had gained her talents by making a wish. He, however, begrudgingly refuses any idea that he is trapped in a time loop unless some sort of irrefutable evidence can be placed before him. Once presented with proof, he speculates that breaking the loop will set recent arrivals free, but suspects those who were here when the time loop was created are lost forever.

##### Aaron Grint

This middle-aged [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) of the Hooded Lanterns used to come to the Black Ivory Inn during his youth, and was a big fan of Miss Charlotte. He sits in a corner with his hood up smoking a pipe. He blissfully believes he has returned to his lost youth and has forgotten the horrors he witnessed in the Civil War. The return of his memories drives him into a rage.

##### Anika Patel

This human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) of the Silver Order devours meal after meal while enjoying the music. She has forgotten that she came to Drakkenheim to fight with the Silver Order, and now believes her oath is to protect Miss Charlotte. Anika is willing to help, but is bewildered by the idea of a time loop. It takes extreme convincing for her to accept the concept. Regardless, she stands up to quell any violence that breaks out in the tavern.

##### Balthazar Adamos

This human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of the Falling Fire came to the Black Ivory Inn to investigate the haunting music. He doesn't drink, so he's maintained his memories through several loops already, and his inability to escape is driving him mad. Balthazar has now claimed a room upstairs and locked himself inside. He becomes crazed if someone mentions the time loop to him, but is terrified that ending the loop will mean his death. He came to Drakkenheim to participate in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire, and believes if he dies his soul will forever wander in darkness.

##### Fate Hope

A human [scoundrel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) clad in the colours of the Queen's Men, Fate arrived at the Black Ivory Inn looking for the smugglers tunnel. After talking to a few of the patrons, she sat at the bar to have a drink and lost her memories. She now spends each loop knocking back a few pints at the bar.

#### Approach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From the outside, the Black Ivory Inn appears perfectly normal. The sounds of beautiful music can be heard from a block away and the lights are all on. The sounds of revelry and clanging glasses are heard within, drawing those who wander by towards the inn. The inn itself is a small square building two storeys tall with a porch that wraps fully around it. It has a sign hanging above the door that reads "Black Ivory Inn, Come for a drink, Stay for the company."
^27e

#### Inn

##### The Piano Bar

Richly appointed with velvet curtains and gleaming varnished tables, each set with a candle in a glass bowl. Two well-dressed wait staff and the well-groomed bartender smile warmly.

##### Stage

Upon a candlelit stage in the far corner of the room stands a jet black piano with glistening white keys. [Miss Charlotte](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md) is found here playing most of the time.

- The piano has AC 15 and 30 hit points. It is immune to non-magical damage.  

##### Kitchens and Pantries

Most of the meals served at the Black Ivory Inn were prepared foods purchased from local bakers, farmers, and butchers.

##### Scullery

Washing rooms for laundry.

##### Inn Rooms

Several comfortable inn rooms each with two beds, a chest of drawers, a small table, and an armchair. Several also include a wardrobe or baths. A common privy on each floor is kept clean and fresh.

#### Basement

##### Storage Cellar

This mundane cellar is stocked with a few kegs of ale, and has a large wall filled with fine wines of various ages and assortments. Most of them are Crownland wines from the north vineyard of Drakkenheim. Many jars and crates of preserved foods and dried fruits and berries can also be found, along with sacks of grains and flour, and a few household tools and appliances. At the back of the cellar is an old oak door with a padlock on it.

##### Gambling Den

This room is clearly appointed for preparing smuggling operations and as a place for secret communication, planning, or illegal gambling to take place. The room is sparse of decorations save for a few round tables and some of the older stools from upstairs. The tables are laid out with decks of cards, bottles of booze, and even a map pinned on the wall that details the underground passages, smugglers' tunnels and sewer systems of Drakkenheim. Currently there is a private meeting happening down here between Captain Wicket and his squad. One of the [bandit captains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) stands at the door to make sure they aren't disturbed as they lay out plans for smuggling a rare painting into Drakkenheim to sell to a fence procuring rare art for a local exhibit. The crew are hostile towards unwanted guests and tell any who come near that they are having a private meeting and they best go back upstairs before they start trouble.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/048-05-003.card-box.webp#center)

##### Smuggler's Warehouse

The Smuggler's Warehouse is in disarray. There are smashed crates and a spray of gold coins across the floor. A shelf along the wall has toppled over and splintered along the ground. Along the far wall is an inconspicuous set of thick wooden doors that are locked with a large padlock. In the corner of the room is the [protean abomination](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md). It is a massive mound of flesh occupying the upper corner of the room, with sticky fleshy tendrils clinging to the various walls and surfaces around it. It looks like it's spreading outwards towards the door - it has grown and caked over the smuggler's tunnel doors almost completely, and one can make out bits of debris, wood, and gold that have been enveloped by the spreading horror.

- Stuck in the side of the creature is the remnant of a grand piano, and on the front of the creature one can make out a feminine face, twisted in horror, with glowing octarine eyes and a gaping mouth. The abomination has several other eyes and mouths around it that all moan and cry as one approaches. Its' eyes become fixed on anyone who enters the room.  

##### Underground Tunnel

The smuggler's tunnel is a long straight tunnel that goes on as far as one can see. It is lined with occasional torches.

- A small satchel hanging on the wall has a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [dancing lights](Mechanics/spells/dancing-lights.md) and a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md).  
- The tunnel connects to the Old Town cistern beneath Slaughterstone Square.

> In the deepest parts of the city, the Haze is as thick as pea soup...if only it tasted like it.

#### Time-Lost Streets

A trapped victim exiting the Black Ivory Inn enters into an illusory version of Drakkenheim as it was fifteen years ago. Once victims travel out of line of sight of the Black Ivory Inn, they immediately appear back before the inn again as if the streets themselves looped back around. All the doors and windows of all the buildings seem to open into a crudely rendered room, but when entered, a character appears back in the taproom of the Black Ivory Inn.

The folk walking the streets are merely phantasms with dim awareness. They repeat only a few short phrases such as "Lovely day today, isn't it." "Strange thing in the sky, that." or "I'll be on my way, then..." If attacked or damaged, they die, and the others scream and run.

> [!note] Developments
> 
> **Check out anytime you'd like.** With the protean abomination destroyed, the inn returns to the state it was meant to be in. The creature dissolves into nothing but a pile of goo and within it rests a chunk of meteoric iron with `2d4` fragments of delerium embedded in it. The ceiling of the inn has mostly collapsed from the impact and a clear hole in the floor leads directly into the basement where the abomination lay. The inn lies in shambles, another nondescript ruin of Drakkenheim. But, the entrance to the smugglers tunnel is still very much intact, and Open Mike's corpse can be found amongst the bodies of the patrons. The key to the smuggler's tunnel is safely fastened on his belt.
> 
> **A Safe Passage.** The smuggler's tunnel now lays open to the players. The players can choose to use this tunnel that leads them directly to the cistern below Slaughterstone Square without provoking a random encounter. They come out from an inconspicuous grate in the floor of the cistern that the monsters of Drakkenheim seem to have overlooked. Once there, the sewers function as normal.
> 
> **Thankful Pilgrim.** If he survives, the priest is endlessly thankful to be rid of the Black Ivory Inn and to still be alive and offers the party a [bag of holding](Mechanics/items/bag-of-holding.md) or an [alchemy jug](Mechanics/items/alchemy-jug.md). He asks if they would accompany him to Saint Selina's Monastery. He would most like to introduce them to Lucretia Mathias and speak highly of their courageous and heroic deeds. He latches on to the characters, believing them to be the prophesied heroes that the book of Falling Fire spoke of.
> 
> **Friendly Factions.** The other survivors are all a little dazed from their time spent in the inn, confused and in shock of the grim reality they have just been awoken into. They all thank the characters and agree to speak highly of them to their leaders and commanders. If the characters made enemies of any of the survivors, or if they boldly helped them or rescued them, those stories are brought back to the factions they represented.

## Buckledown Row

> [!quote] A quote from Blackjack Mel  
> 
> Listen, if you wanna make it in this town, you gotta stick with me, right? I know people. I can make connections, introductions! You got some fight in you. You wanna meet the Queen of Thieves? I got your ticket right here!

This infamous row of dive bars and dingy taverns lies on the southeastern outskirts of Drakkenheim. Decades ago, these were the choice watering holes for lower-class labourers, sweat-soaked craftspeople, and assorted scoundrels who inhabited Drakkenheim. Today, Buckledown Row is a hub for outlaws, outcasts, scavengers, and worse. The taverns are mostly intact, and close enough to the edge of town for a band of rough-and-tumble ruffians to make the trek easy enough, but still far enough into the city to dissuade others from following. Ever since the Queen of Thieves brought the gangs under her influence, the street has been controlled by the Queen's Men: bandits and brigands meet here on neutral ground, join in revelry together, trade with fences and smugglers, and only occasionally slit each other's throats. There's few rules and even less order. Flowing ale and gold tend to calm the most violent disputes, but for anything else the hidden fighting pit is the perfect place to settle feuds, make some bets, and lose a few teeth.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/049-05-002.buckledown-row.webp#center)

### Overview

On the surface, Buckledown Row might appear to be the stronghold for the Queen's Men in Drakkenheim. It's certainly a gathering point for the gangs and a hub for illicit activity, and the characters just might be able to make contact with the Queen of Thieves here. Alternatively, they might just want to crack some skulls in the fighting ring!

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Rules of Buckledown Row

Characters might hear rumours about Buckledown Row, especially if they frequent the Skull & Sword Taphouse in Emberwood Village. If they have been working with Blackjack Mel, he'll even suggest the characters test their might in the fighting pits. He offers to sponsor them as a fighting team and act as their manager (for an equal cut of the winnings, of course!). If they're interested, he encourages them to travel there with him. He'll be sure to set up a good matchup! Blackjack Mel explains that anyone who proves themselves in the Buckledown Row fighting pit wins the honor to face the Queen of Thieves' personal champion in her secret arena (located in the Court of Thieves). It's the only surefire way to meet the Queen of Thieves, and she's even proclaimed that she'll grant one personal favour to anyone who can defeat her champion. Of course, no one's actually managed to beat them yet...

### Interactions

The Queen of Thieves makes an appearance in Buckledown Row, usually appearing for a few hours on a Friday or Saturday evening to watch the best fights.

The bandits that fill the streets and taverns might not notice strangers, but also are not afraid to stab or steal from anyone who seems like they don't belong.

Asking around the taverns and streets, it's easy to gather that the fighting pits below the taverns are the way people around here get known. Many of the fighters in the pits are renowned legends amongst the gangs. Anyone who can defeat the other fighters gets to take a crack at the Queen's champion in the royal fighting pits. Beat the champion, and you get a private audience with the Queen.

The five taverns in Buckledown Row are all filled with various gangs of the Queen's Men. Around every corner is gambling, cards, dice, and occasionally people brawling openly in the streets. A body being thrown out a window, or the sound of shattering glass or splintering wood are so common that they become almost part of the backdrop of the place. Everyone here is a little rough around the edges and if you stick out too much you'll draw a lot of unwanted attention.

Consult the Outlaws and Scoundrels from the Queen's Men Dossier for some of the symbols and characters to fill out the taverns. The gangs all mingle here but usually each gang has a preferred tavern that their leader can be found in, and a few characteristics to help bring any NPCs to life.

If the party manages to fit in without drawing unwanted attention, the gangs pay them no mind above anyone else. The gangs are gaining so many members that if you are in Buckledown Row, most assume you ought to be there. Discussing other factions, or any plans or adventures that seem suspicious, might arouse the attention of people nearby. Also if the party is acting awkward or nervous, this may draw attention - it may also help their cause to dress in appropriate gang attire or to have symbols of a gang on their gear. Again, the Outlaws and Scoundrels detailed in the Queen's Men Dossier can provide information the party might gather to help them disguise themselves or hatch a plan to fit in. If the party openly approaches a gang leader without invitation, they may gain some attention as well, but most of the leaders are eager to hear out anyone bold enough to approach them and will engage with the party in amused curiosity. Otherwise the gangs accept the characters as more new recruits and try and encourage them with drinking, games, sometimes a fight, or a game of cards. Or maybe trying to push them to join the fighting pits below.

#### Buckledown Row

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Roughshod fences and makeshift barricades block off this muddy street of ramshackle taverns. Crudely made bridges stretch between the rooftops, and crooked street lamps glow brightly in the mists. Laughter, cheering, and a general uproar echo down the alleys from a motley assortment of thugs, ruffians, cutthroats, and scoundrels who drink, gamble, and traffic down the street. Keen-eyed sharpshooters look down from the lookout posts, and a pair of muscled bruisers stand watch outside the ramparts.
^299

- At any time, 21 (`6d6`) [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) stroll the streets, and 5 (`2d4`) [scoundrels](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) lurk upon the rooftops. A pair of bugbear [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) are posted at each entrance. They'll drive off anyone who looks like a member of the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, but they let anyone else through.  

If conflict with the factions is escalating, `1d4` Queen's Men strike teams might be posted around Buckledown Row in case of trouble.

#### Wishing Well

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An ancient moss-covered fieldstone well rests on a terrace behind one of the taverns. Upon a skeleton nailed to a gnarled tree nearby is a crudely-painted sign that reads "Make a Wish". Peering down the well reveals an impenetrable gloom.
^29b

- Each week, representatives from each of the hundred gangs of the Queen's Men deposit their tribute to the Queen of Thieves here by dropping a marked satchel of gold or gems down the well. Each outfit pays a sum of 100 gold or more, depending on their arrangements with the Queen.  
- The gangs don't know what happens afterwards, but the Queen always knows when someone misses a payment.  
- The bottom of the well is concealed by a permanent [major image](Mechanics/spells/major-image.md) and a silent [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md) spell, but their magic has been hidden with the [arcanist's magic aura](Mechanics/spells/nystuls-magic-aura.md) spell. Below is a [portable hole](Mechanics/items/portable-hole.md) that collects the tribute.  
- In secret, the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) herself arrives invisibly throughout the week to collect her tribute. She always leaves behind a sack of gold. This "float" is used by the Queen to track down anyone who robs her: since she once possessed the gold, she will [scry](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) upon the coins to locate any thief who rips her off.  

#### Sweaty Bugbear

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This small ramshackle taphouse is little more than a dank hole in the wall. Almost literally. The door is missing and the wall where the entrance was has been blasted away to leave just a gaping hole that people come and go through. No signage seems to exist but in the large window next to the blasted entrance is the cook of the place. There is a smoking grill where a large bugbear named Brian is cooking some charred-looking meat; he is wet with sweat caused by the heat of the grill. Baskerville, the leader of the Howlin' Dogs gang, sits at a table in the corner with cushioned seats, a bottle of mead in hand and talking with some scary-looking thieves. There is a game of knife throwing happening in the back. There also seems to be a gnome in a top hat strapped to the target they are throwing knives at.
^29d

- The knife throwing thugs are willing to let anyone join. If you hit the gnome, you lose. If you hit between his legs it's 20 points. Between an arm and leg is 10, and between an arm and his head is 30. They also explain that the gnome tried to skim 400gp off a payment to Baskerville and so he's on the board tonight.  
- Baskerville is amused by anyone coming to talk to him and listens to whatever they have to say. However if it doesn't involve smashing, killing, or getting rich, he laughs at the intrusion and waves them away. If anyone in the party looks tough, he challenges them to arm wrestle for fun and wants to bet 20 gold on it.  
- If anyone wants to join the Howlin' Dogs, as long as they have renown with the Queen's Men, Baskerville offers any strong and tough looking characters a place if they can beat his Fighting Pit champion, Bloodhound.

#### Sneaky McGee's

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large neon-painted sign of a ram skull with swirling designs and patterns inside it is posted on the front of this old building. It's three storeys high and has balconies all along the top two floors, with a large wooden door that has a cobra motif on it. Inside the tavern there are several small private booths with tables and seating for four to six people. At the far end of the tavern is a small stage where some rough looking scoundrels are playing instruments and riling the place up. A long bar along one side has a row of red-velvet-topped stools contrasting against the dark almost black wood of the bar. A dwarf woman behind the bar named Reeda Blackstone is polishing glasses. She is friendly, kind-hearted, and welcoming to any who come through the door. Everyone who orders a drink from her tips her one gold and says "Thank you Reeda." Above the bar is a wall of swords and daggers, all stuck in place in an array of metal and leather. The entire wall is just thousands of blades. Sitting at the end of the bar is Veronica Venom and her gang.
^29f

- People in the tavern will tell you that Reeda may seem nice, but she's a ruthless killer and used to be one of the most notorious assassins in Westemär before she retired. Everyone respects her, and she demands respect.  
- If the characters order anything from Reeda without tipping her a gold piece , or dont say "Thank you Reeda," she grabs them and asks "Are you new in town honey? You seem lost." before motioning for Veronica to come over. This usually grabs everyone in the tavern's attention. If the characters don't smooth-talk their way out, there could be blood.  
- Veronica ignores anyone who approaches her that she didn't invite. If she notices anyone who looks stealthy and like they have a killer instinct, she may ask one of her gang members to go invite that character and that character alone over. She offers the character a spot in her gang if they can defeat her champion, Mamba Jones.

#### Padlock Tavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to this tavern is covered top to bottom in keys of various shapes and sizes. Gold, silver, bronze, copper, some rusted, some shining. All manner of keys adorn the door. Upon entering the tavern one can see the walls are covered in padlocks of equally varying shapes and sizes. A bunch of round tables fill the centre of this building. And although two stories tall, there is no upstairs save for a small balcony and a spiral staircase going up to it. A man sits up on the balcony in an animal fur coat with a large purple mohawk. The tavern is filled with leather clad bandits with spike studded armour and chains hanging from all over their gear. There is a lot of hollering and it seems a fight is breaking out every couple minutes somewhere in the place. There is a small corner bar with a shelf of various bottles of alcohol spanning both storeys from floor to ceiling. A long rickety ladder transcends the shelves on a wheeled system so it can slide back and forth across the many types of alcohol. Three goblins work the bar. One on the ladder, the other below catching and tossing bottles, and one making the drinks and sliding them down the bar to whoever catches them. People don't seem to ask questions, the goblins seem to make whatever mix of booze suits them and toss it down the bar to whoever catches it. Occasionally a glass slides right off the bar and smashes on the wall to which everyone in the tavern hollers and cheers.
^2a1

- [Blackjack Mel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) can be found near the end of the bar with a few of his trusted thieves. He has a private booth that he uses to discuss business.  
- Leon the Swine doesnt leave his balcony, but if anyone wants to talk to him they are welcome to come do so. He demands that anyone who speaks to him calls him the Swine Prince. He refers to the characters as his "Little Piggies."  
- To join the Pins & Clubs all you have to do is kill someone. Leon explains that they're the biggest gang in Drakkenheim. Other gangs claim to be smarter, stronger, braver, more cunning. But no one has the numbers of the Pins & Clubs. So to keep things proper, ya gotta go to one of the other taverns and kill someone from a different gang. Come back with their right hand and Leon will let ya join. He gestures to a box in the corner of the balcony overflowing with right hands.  

![Inn Keeper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/053-05-005.inn-keeper.webp#center)

#### Old Imperial Public House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This long and large building still stands almost entirely intact and seems in pretty good condition. Its blue-painted wooden exterior still holds up to only moderate chipping. The large sign outside reads "The Old Imperial" with a coat of arms on the door. Inside the tavern is fitted with beautiful hand carved tables and chairs, and an ornately carved maple bar stretches down the length of the house with a massive wall of wines and spirits behind it. There is a raised section to the bar up a few small steps where Rose Carver and her gang sit around a large table and drink. The bar is tended by a large dragonborn named Israel. There are several more heavily clad and armed folk by the bar chatting with Israel.
^2a3

- Israel takes in new recruits for the fighting pits downstairs. If you want to fight you have to register with him. You need a crew, a name, and a catch phrase. The audience pays more when they have a catchy team to cheer for. So make it good. Once you sign up, if you are new, you "gotta do the rounds." Meaning fight all other champions.  
- Rose Carver is looking for new recruits. She likes people who are strong-willed and cunning in battle. Not brutes or overconfident muscle heads as she calls them, but tough folk looking to make a difference, one way or another.  
- To join you just need to agree to give Rose Carver five percent of any jobs you do under her guidance. If you agree, you get the symbol and join her ranks.  

#### Smee's Palace

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The largest tap house in Buckledown Row, this large building used to be a popular spot for local musical shows and plays. The large stage at the back of the tavern still stands, and often you can find a group of bards here playing songs or occasionally a play being performed. The place is filled with elegant gold-accented wooden-carved features, and there is a large chandelier with what seems like over one hundred candles. Each table is illuminated by red wax candles in golden candelabras. The place feels the fanciest of the local establishments. The server is a tall elven woman with white hair and piercing hazel eyes named Tilda. She speaks elegantly and softly to any who come to her. Even though she is soft spoken, one can hear her clear as day through the noise of the ongoings of the tavern. Sitting at the table closest to the stage is Christian Lament and his gang.
^2a5

- There is a staircase behind the bar that leads down to the fighting pits and people are constantly coming and going from below. You can hear the sound of cheering amid the thuds and clangs of combat.  
- Christain Lament hates being interrupted if there is a show on. He is a huge fan of music and theatre, and especially musical theatre. Any interruption causes him to immediately respond "Someone have this one killed please," to which usually no one does anything, but if the characters persist Christan will sigh and turn to them.  
- Christian is uninterested in any proposals from the characters unless they cater to his massive ego and explain the need for someone more cunning, smart, or handsome than any of them. Pleading to Christan's vanity is a sure way to change his demeanor towards you.  
- If one of the characters is charismatic and cunning with their words he may ask them if they have what it takes to be a Wounded Heart. If they want to join his gang they need to defeat Dorian Dare in the fighting pits, then Christain will allow them to join the gang.  

#### Fighting Pits

Below the taverns of Buckledown Row, the basements and sewers have been restructured into a makeshift fighting arena. They are crowded with people either there to fight, or betting and cheering on the combatants.

##### Infirmary

A human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) by the name of Patty Tomkins is working here with her gnome assistant Marv to heal up some unfortunate fighters who didn't win in the pits. The two of them have some crude medical equipment and a few spells to try and patch up any who are worse for wear.

- She is willing to cast [cure wounds](Mechanics/spells/cure-wounds.md) on the party if they need healing and asks for tips in exchange. She knows the Queen's private fighting pits are down the sewers some ways but has never been there. She's very tired of how injured people get in the pits and wishes they were just better at fighting.  

##### Meeting Room

A few small tables and chairs are set up in this otherwise barren stone room. There is a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md), 2 [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md), and 5 [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) scheming up plans in here at any given time.

##### Prisoners Stocks

A few people are locked in some rickety old cells here. They are watched over by a rough looking bugbear [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) named Ludwig. He says that the prisoners broke the trust of their gangs and so are forced to be the early rounds of the pit's competitions. Basically, they buffer the champions with a few punching bags. Once the punching bag is spent, their gang leader can decide if they are allowed back in, or if they will be killed.

##### Fighting Pit

The cleared dirt-covered floor is caked in blood stains, mud, and other fluids that are best not asked about. A central square is marked off by makeshift wooden barricades, around which about forty bandits gather waiting for the next match. A big human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) named Bull is refereeing the fights. Next to him, a halfling [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) with a moustache named Rocky is taking bets and wagers on the next fight.

##### Fence

Tig is a young human [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) who looks no older than fifteen. He sits on one end of a table in this room and is extremely excited and welcoming to anyone who enters. He exclaims "Welcome to Tig's Shop!" to all who enter. Tig is accompanied by a half-orc [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) named Tony who stands quietly nearby in case of any problems. Tig sells a few select stolen items (choose three common magic items every time the characters show up as well as `1d4` health potions and `1d4` [aqua delerium](Mechanics/items/aqua-delerium-dodk.md)). Tig is also willing to buy any stolen goods from the party if they have any.

#### Pit Fighters

When characters join the fighting pits they may fight individually or as a team. If they fight one on one they only fight the champion of that team, or a tag team with two champions at a time - if they are doing tag teams, a [thug](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) joins Mamba Jones. Work your way down the list until all champions are defeated.

- Glassjaw Jake, a human [bandit](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) who looks pretty beat up already  
- Smiley Pete, a dwarf [thug](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) with no teeth  
- Dorian Dare, a human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) with the Wounded Hearts symbol on his shoulder  
- Bloodhound, a Hobgoblin [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) with the Howlin' Dogs symbol on her shoulder  
- Mamba Jones, a halfling [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) with the Catacomb Cobras symbol on her shoulder  

#### Pit Fight Rules

- Fights can either be one-on-one, or a tag team.  
- Tag team matches pit equally-sized teams against each other.  
- In a tag team, fighters "tag in" and "tag out" by visibly tapping each other. Whoever is tagging in must be wholly outside the ring, whoever is tagging out must be wholly within.  
- You must stay in the ring. If you aren't in the ring at the end of your turn, you lose.  
- If you know magic, you can use it. You can use whatever gear you've got.  
- Your team loses if any member outside the ring is caught casting spells or otherwise influencing anyone in the ring.  
- Team members who are tagged out are allowed to cast spells on each other.  
- No poison! We mean it! If you get caught with it, we'll make you drink it all.  
- No potions! If anyone on your team drinks a potion or is caught under the effects of one, your team loses, and we're taking all your potions. The only exception is using a potion to save the life of a knocked out teammate.  
- No invisibility or darkness stuff! It's no fun if the audience can't see you fighting!  
- If you get knocked [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), you're out. The pit master will take you off the field and stabilize you so you don't die.  
- If someone gets taken out, you can send in another member to replace them.  
- If it's your first night in the pits, you have to fight.  
- There's no rule against killing your opponent, but generally speaking this is frowned on.

If they win, they gain an audience with the Queen. They might surmise and uncover that the Queen's chambers are through a secret sewer passage.

## Chapel of Saint Brenna

Chapels devoted to the Sacred Flame form the heart of many neighbourhoods in Drakkenheim. These were places of religious worship, weddings, community gatherings, and funerals, as each stands over a small crypt where common folk interred the cremated remains of the dead. However, many are also the resting place for the mummified bodies of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame, and some even contain reliquaries for holy artefacts. The Chapel of Saint Brenna holds a particularly valuable relic whose location was unknown until recently: the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md). Now three factions seek this relic: the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Knights of the Silver Order, and the Queen's Men.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/055-05-007.chapel.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, characters explore the dungeon crypts under the Chapel of Saint Brenna to recover the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md). Complicating matters, at least two other factions have dispatched strike teams of their own to claim the *Sceptre*. If you wish to really challenge the characters, you could add a third! When the characters arrive, one faction team is already searching the upper level of the chapel, and another rival faction will arrive on the scene later to contest the claim. It's up to the characters to decide how to deal with these faction agents: they could fight them, trick them, sneak past them, or negotiate with them in some way.

The puzzles in the crypt invite player characters to use their own creativity to develop out-of-the-box solutions, as there is no "correct" way to overcome them. However, if characters rouse the remains of the interred clerics and paladins in the process, they'll have an interesting problem on their hands as the undead will rejuvenate when destroyed unless laid to rest again properly.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### The Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio

Recently, a group of rival adventurers found letters and missives in another ruin that indicated the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md) was buried beneath the Chapel of Saint Brenna. Unfortunately, these adventurers disagreed over how to use this information and went their separate ways. They each brought the discovery to the attention of different factions. Now, the race is on to recover the Sceptre first! While each faction could send their own strike team to the chapel, whichever faction has the closest relationship to your party seeks out the characters' aid instead.

A messenger from one of the factions seeks the characters out in Emberwood Village, urgently requesting them to meet with one of the following faction lieutenants:

- [Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) at the Chapel of Saint Ardenna  
- [Nathaniel Flint](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) at the Hendrix Farm  
- [Blackjack Mel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) at the Skull & Sword Taphouse  

The lieutenant gets right down to business.

The characters need to act now, as other factions are already sending agents of their own.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - **Ophelia Reed.** "We cannot allow the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio to fall into the hands of thieves or cultists. Help us retrieve it, and when you meet me back at Camp Dawn, we'll see you are rewarded faithfully for your efforts."  
^2b3

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - **Nathaniel Flint.** "We see little value in worldly gold and silver, but if you help us with this task, you would be champions of our faith. You must bring the Sceptre to Lucretia Mathias herself, in the hallowed halls of Saint Selina's Monastery. There she will grant you a great boon."  
^2b4

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> - **Blackjack Mel.** "The Sceptre is exceptionally valuable to the right buyer... but if you ain't got the right connections you'll never move it on your own. You'll get your cut, but if we get wind of you trying to double deal us by selling it yourself, it's gonna be bad news for you."  
^2b5

### Interactions

Whichever factions the characters *aren't* working with send their own strike teams to the Chapel of Saint Brenna. The Silver Order strike team always arrives first, and the Followers of the Falling Fire arrive just as the characters are leaving the site with the sceptre. The Queen's Men can either arrive first (if the characters are working for the Silver Order) or show up if the characters take a short rest (if the characters are working for the Followers of the Falling Fire).

#### Followers of the Falling Fire

Katja Braun, a human [cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) leads 8 human [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md). She is a thin middle-aged woman who believes she is guided by righteous purpose.

**Knights of the Silver Order**. Ser Bryce Landry, a human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) leads 4 human [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md). This clumsy and lanky warrior insists on doing things "properly" and refuses to damage the chapel or defile the crypts in any way. Each has a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) that they hitch to the trees outside the chapel.

#### Queen's Men

Rorsh, a human [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) with horrible burns all over his body leads 8 human [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md). They were promised 1,000 gp for the job, but are always looking out for a better deal.

Consult the **Roleplaying Traits** in the **Faction Dossier** for ideas on how to roleplay these faction strike teams, and the **Strike Teams** section for details on their combat tactics.

#### Chapel Grounds

A deteriorating chapel lies atop a small hillock in the middle of a desolate residential borough. Despite heavy damage, its domed slate roof rises above the surrounding townhouses. Two cylinder-shaped towers flank the arched double-door entrance. One tower has completely collapsed into a mound of stone rubble roughly fifteen feet high, leaving a great breach leading into the chapel at ground level. The other tower remains standing up to the second storey. Piles of debris and stone surround the tower's base. Elegant arched windows filled with stained glass mosaics decorate the chapel, but most are shattered and broken.

#### [1] Crematory Garden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Behind the chapel is a small terrace with stone benches and a sundial, and a short footpath connects the chapel to a walled garden to the east. Two soil plots within served as sites for funeral pyres. A melancholic statue of a plate-armoured woman holds vigil over these crematory mounds, clasping a silver rod in both hands over her chest.
^2bd

- A metal hatch behind the statue is locked with a padlock. The key is long gone, but the lock can be picked or broken with a **DC 20 Strength** or **Dexterity** check. If opened, it leads to a steep staircase leading down to the Crematory Passage (Area 6).  
- DC 10 [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion). This statue depicts Saint Tarna, the founder of the faith of the Sacred Flame.  
- DC 10 [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion). The Faith of the Sacred Flame cremates the dead and keeps their ashes and bones within chapel crypts.  
- The statue holds a silver [immovable rod](Mechanics/items/immovable-rod.md). It is one inch in diameter and fifteen inches long. The button on the rod is engaged. If released, the rod slides out of the statue's hands. The rod is perfectly smooth save for a wedge-shaped divot on the bottom edge. The rod functions as a handle for the winches in the undercroft (Area 4).  
- If the Queen's Men strike team arrives first, they are encountered here. They've mistaken the [immovable rod](Mechanics/items/immovable-rod.md) in the crematory garden for the true [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md). They suspect (incorrectly) that some kind of trap will be triggered when the button is pressed. They're trying to figure out how to disarm it, and failing, since there isn't actually any trap here.  

#### [2] Chapel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The double doors open with a loud creak to a short carpeted hallway decorated with candelabras. The hallway leads directly into the chapel sanctuary. Puddles of brackish rainwater pool in the basin created by the collapsed tower roof.
> 
> At the heart of the chapel is a three-tiered stone altar set with a large bronze brazier. Petrified wood and ashes rest within. A few prayer benches and a small altar box lay nearby. Worshippers of the Sacred Flame once gathered here, encircling the brazier hand-in-hand to worship.
> 
> Dirt, dust, and debris cover most of the floor, here and there bits of cracked paint from the floor mosaic are visible beneath. Painted on the walls between the windows are fading frescoes of the saints and martyrs of the Sacred Flame. The three alcoves each hold a large statue marred by time and weather. The northern alcove depicts the legendary Saint Tarna holding steadfast against a massive two-headed demon with long tentacles for arms. The eastern alcove features a stoic statue of Saint Vitruvio, the Patron Saint of Drakkenheim. The western statue depicts Saint Brenna, for whom the chapel is named. She is shown performing the miracle of resurrection.
> 
> Scattered about the room are ruined texts, iron braziers, and bronze lamps, some of which still hang from the timbers on the roof. The room reeks of bitumen.
^2bf

- Two [flasks of alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md) can be scavenged from the brazier basin.  
- The books and texts here are common copies of the holy books and hymns of the Sacred Flame, and contain no rare knowledge or information.  
- The altar box contains a silver ewer worth 25 gp, [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [bless](Mechanics/spells/bless.md) and [faerie fire](Mechanics/spells/faerie-fire.md), two *spell scrolls* of [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md), a silver holy symbol of the Sacred Flame, three vials of anointed oils (counts as [holy water](Mechanics/items/holy-water-flask.md)), and a block of incense.  
- The back door has rotted off its hinges, and collapses with a loud clatter unless carefully opened.  
- The puddles are slowly draining through a crack in the floor.  
- The statue of Saint Tarna bears the inscription *"Saint Tarna holds silver truth that opens the way to the healing light of the Sacred Flame."* This refers to the [immovable rod](Mechanics/items/immovable-rod.md) held by the statue outside in the Crematory Garden.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stone spiral staircase leads down to the undercroft. Halfway down the stairs is an iron portcullis gate that bars the way. A lock is set into the gate.
^2c0

- The gate key is missing. Instead, the gate can be broken down with a **DC 20 Strength** check or the lock picked with one minute of work and a **DC 15 Dexterity (thieves tools)** check.  
- A faint sound of crackling flame and swirling dust can be heard if one quietly steps down the stairs, with the occasional yelp, cackle, or grumbling in Primordial. These noises are caused by the mephits dwelling in the undercroft.  
- If the Silver Order strike team arrives first, they're encountered here. They hitch their horses to a tree outside, watched over by a single [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md). Ser Landry and the others explore the site. They've set down their weapons by the door, and are looking for the key to open the gate to the undercroft. Unfortunately, they don't realize it's totally gone, and they'll waste hours searching because they refuse to "defile" the chapel by breaking down the doors.  

#### [3] Undercroft

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beneath the chapel is a crypt. Urns, clay pots, and painted vases are kept in hundreds of alcoves cut into the walls. Smaller niches in the three central pillars hold human skulls with half-melted candles resting atop them like crowns. The vaulted ceiling is ten feet above, with several pillars supporting the chapel foundations. Iron chandeliers and bronze candelabras are set throughout, many candles still burning with flickering flames in purple, green, and octarine. A peculiar breeze sweeps through this chamber in strange directions, stirring up small dust devils and causing the candlelight to shudder erratically. Two alcoves contain sturdy oak doors bound with iron lattices, both leading east.
> 
> Dripping water leaks down from a crack in the ceiling in the south end of the chamber.
^2c2

- Ashes, bone fragments, and sometimes skulls are placed in urns, wrapped in linen, or contained in small chests, then interred in the niches in this undercroft. They bear inscriptions marking the names of the deceased.  
- The water is leaking into floor cracks in the earth.  

#### Ashley, Dusty, Smokey, and Cindy

> "Stop there, meatbag! You're trespassing! You better have brought us something nice, fleshie!"
^2c4

This chamber is now home to several mephits; two [steam mephits](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/steam-mephit.md), a [dust mephit](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/dust-mephit.md), and a [magma mephit](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/magma-mephit.md). These mephits were originally dispatched by the Amethyst Academy to scout the ruins fifteen years ago, but gave up on their mission and made the undercroft their new home. They quite enjoy their surroundings that are filled with materials and elements similar to their own compositions. They will suffer no trespassers in their "home" unless they are given a suitable gift: a gemstone of some kind. They have little understanding of the wider world, but enjoy inflicting capricious cruelty upon human "fleshies". However, they are terrified of anyone who wears the garb of the Amethyst Academy, and begin crying and ask for forgiveness from the character.

#### [4A and 4B] Winch Chambers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the centre of this small round chamber is a stout metal post three feet high and about one foot thick. There is a one-inch diameter cylindrical notch about four inches deep cut just below the topmost edge.
^2c6

- The posts function as winches connected to the Tomb Doors in the levels below. Winch A opens the Tomb Doors marked "A". Turning Winch "B" opens the Tomb Doors marked "B".  
- Unfortunately, there are no handles attached to the winches, which makes turning them to open the doors exceptionally difficult.  
- The [immovable rod](Mechanics/items/immovable-rod.md) borne by the statue in the crematory garden outside functions as a handle.  
- When a lever is set into the post, a character can use an action to turn the winch and open the doors. A counterweight system unwinds the winches and closes the doors after one round, unless the winch is held in place (requiring an action) or the [immovable rod](Mechanics/items/immovable-rod.md) is activated.  
- A substitute could be fashioned if the original can't be located. A wooden lever has a fifty percent chance of breaking each round it is in use, but a metal lever works perfectly (but needs to be held in place)  
- A character working with the right tools could jury rig a stopper or mechanism to hold the winches open with one hour of work and a **DC 15 Intelligence** check.  
- The winch can still be raised without the lever. A character can use an action and make a successful **DC 20 Strength** check, which raises it enough for a person to crawl underneath. This check must be repeated each round thereafter to hold the doors open.  
- If the winch is released, the doors close with a crash, dealing `3d6` bludgeoning damage to anyone underneath them. It takes an action to close the doors safely using the winch.  
- The doors could be held open onced raised. Doing so requires an action and a **DC 23 Strength** check each round.  
- Characters could move a suitably durable object to brace the doors open, but the doors are heavy and could break the brace. Roll a die each round, choosing a larger die for a more durable object (`1d4` for a weak one, `1d12` for a strong one, ect). On a one, the bracing object breaks or snaps and the doors slam shut.  

As there is only one handle between the two winches, access to the Reliquary Chamber (Area 10) normally requires opening one set of doors with one winch, closing it, then moving the handle to the other winch to open the other set of doors, then repeating the process to allow an escape. This means either splitting the party or creating an improvised solution to open all doors simultaneously.

Your players might expect there to be a second immovable rod missing somewhere, and will likely spend some time searching for it. This is intentional, but if you are concerned your players might become unreasonably fixated on finding a second rod, you could place one in the clutches of the [mummy](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) in area 9.

#### [5] Purification Fountain

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This round chamber holds a circular stone font of fresh holy water. An inscription on the edge of the basin reads "May the Sacred Flame keep vigil over the souls of our revered dead."
> 
> The long curved wall of this chamber is separated into five large panels, each painted with murals. Each section shows three Flamekeepers performing the funeral rites for a slain paladin.
^2c8

- The first shows the body being prepared: one priest washes the body, another wraps it in linens, the last collects the paladin's weapon, shield, and helm.  
- The second mural shows two priests placing the body on a tomb slab, while the third places a holy symbol in its hands and a gemstone upon each eyelid.  
- In the third mural, the priests anoint the body with holy water or sacred oils.  
- In the fourth mural, the priests place and light the candles around the body.  
- The final mural shows one priest reading from a scroll while the others join hands and recite a hymn while standing beside the body.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The opposite short curved wall contains several worn shelves and alcoves filled with vials, tools, dusty scrolls, and thin linens.
^2c9

- The shelves contain equipment and tools used to prepare the body, six vials of sacred oils, and [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md), and [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md).  
- Amongst the vials here are two [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).  
- `2d6` vials of [holy water](Mechanics/items/holy-water-flask.md) can be filled from the font.  
- DC 12 [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion). The Faith of the Sacred Flame treats the remains of clerics and paladins as holy relics. They believe these faithful souls might one day need their earthly bodies again, so they are preserved or mummified rather than cremated. These murals depict this process.  

#### [6] Crematory Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Leaves, grass, dirt, and debris fill the floor in this stone chamber.
^2cb

- The stairs lead to the crematory above. No one has used this passage in ages.  
- The oaken ironbound door is stuck, but can be pushed open with an action.

#### [7] North Crypts

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stone door to this chamber has no apparent handles or hinges. It is engraved with tracery and images of angels and saints laid to rest. An inscription reads: "Compassion and temperance sustain the light; greed and hatred bring darkness."
^2cd

- The stone door to this chamber is raised using the winch in Area 4b.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the door is a hoop-shaped chamber with vaulted ceilings. The chamber is illuminated by dozens of candles placed about six stone sarcophagus slabs set in semicircular alcoves along the walls. Atop each lays the skeletal remains of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame. Tattered cloth covers their bones, a silk sash lain over their eyes. Most rest with arms crossed over their bodies holding a torch in one hand and candle snuffer in the other, but one has a shield, another a helm, and a greatsword etched with celestial runes and glowing with a soft blue light is laid atop another.
^2ce

- Each corpse is a [skeleton](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) that lies in state. Last rites performed over them decades ago hold back the reanimating magic of the Haze. They do not rise unless their remains or possessions are disturbed, in which case the nearby candles snuff out, and they attack the grave robber.  
- The skeletons have the following additional trait:  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > **Rejuvenation.** If the skeleton is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in ten minutes, unless its remains are placed upon the stone slab, surrounded with lit candles, sprinkled with holy water, and a short prayer uttered over them, or a [gentle repose](Mechanics/spells/gentle-repose.md) or [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) is cast upon its remains.  
    ^2cf  
- Treasure. Each skeleton has gemstones placed in their eye sockets: two citrines worth 50 gp each. They also clutch a gold or silver holy symbol of the Sacred Flame worth 25 gp. Finally, the magical greatsword here is called *Twilight*. It is a [+1 greatsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) that sheds dim illumination to fifteen feet at all times. A creature wielding it can speak and understand Celestial. The other weapons or armour are wasting away and worthless.  
- DC 15 [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion). The Haze often causes dead bodies to reanimate spontaneously. Divine rites performed over these remains may prevent this from occurring.  
- If the door was opened recently and then closed, the characters can detect signs of newly disturbed dust and grinding stone with a DC 15 [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) check. The door must have been opened and closed again quite recently, as the dust is still settling.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> To the south lies a stone door engraved with an image of a majestic dragon that reads:
> 
> "No darkness is eternal while our faith fuels the Flame."
^2d1

This door opens to the Hidden Reliquary (Area 10). It's raised using the winch in Area 4a.

#### [8] South Crypts

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stone steps lead down to an ancient cobweb-filled crypt that is little more than a roughly hewn stone passage. The irregular ceiling is ten feet high.
^2d3

- Just as in the North Crypts (Area 7), there are five stone slabs in this chamber bearing the remains of clerics and paladins of the Sacred Flame. See above for the description.  
- Treasure. Each skeleton has gemstones placed in their eye sockets: two citrines worth 50 gp each. They also clutch a gold or silver holy symbol of the Sacred Flame worth 25 gp. Unlike the north crypts there are no magical weapons left behind here.  

At the end of the passage is the stone door to the Tomb of Saint Brenna (Area 9).

#### [9] Tomb of Saint Brenna

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This heavy stone door is painted with the countenance of a serene Flamekeeper in flowing robes. Beneath lies the inscription "Saint Brenna, be you surrounded in light eternal. Rest as one with the Sacred Flame."
^2d5

- The stone door to this chamber is raised using the winch in Area 4b.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Within this cavernous chamber lies a single stone slab surrounded by candles. Upon it rests the mummified body of Saint Brenna. However, leaking water from above has doused the light. Nevertheless, the chamber is illuminated by several standing candelabras surrounded by clay pots and canopic jars.
^2d6

- The preserved corpse of Saint Brenna lies atop a stone sarcophagus at the centre of the room. Leaking water from the damage above has put out the candles surrounding Saint Brenna, awakening her [mummy](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md). Since her body is waterlogged, she isn't vulnerable to fire damage like other mummies. She has the following additional trait:  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > **Rejuvenation.** If the mummy is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in ten minutes, unless its remains are placed upon the stone slab, surrounded with lit candles, sprinkled with holy water, and a short prayer uttered over them, or a [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) is cast upon its remains.  
    ^2d7  
- Saint Brenna rises if the door to her chamber is opened, and begins wandering the crypts, droning softly while misquoting scripture. She is gripped by madness and despair and attacks any living creatures. If she passes near the other skeletons interred within, she spends an action to rouse them to follow her. She doesn't leave the undercroft.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> To the north lies a stone door that bears the engraved countenance of Saint Vitruvio, and is inscribed with the words: "None are forever lost to shadow, candlelight glows brightly in the deepest night."
^2d9

- The door leads to the Hidden Reliquary (Area 10). It's opened using the winch in Area 4a.  

![The Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/059-05-009.sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio.webp#center)

#### [10] Hidden Reliquary

Two doors lead into the reliquary: one from the Tomb of Saint Brenna (Area 9 and opened from Area 4a) and one from the North Crypts (Area 6 and opened from Area 4b).

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the middle of this circular chamber is a large unlit pyre and several piles of ash and charred wood. A statue of Saint Vitruvio is here with two unlit candles set before him. He is an armoured warrior clad in plate wearing a decorated helm. At his right is sheathed a great blade, and a large shield rests at his left side. He holds his hands forwards and upwards towards the heavens, bearing the Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio upon them.
^2db

A character who touches the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md) hears an ethereal voice in their mind that speaks the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Darkness leaves a heavy burden on the heart. The light brings freedom from the weight of sin. If you would take up my scepter, it is not enough to merely bear the light. You must illuminate yourself.
^2dc

While within the crypt, the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md) effectively weighs seven hundred fifty pounds. However, the Sceptre weighs only two pounds when held or carried by a character who is shedding dim or bright light (either magical or nonmagical), or a character who is attuned to it.

![Nathaniel Flint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/060-05-011.nathaniel-portrait.webp#center)

- A character could use a class feature or spell to do so, such as [light](Mechanics/spells/light.md), [faerie fire](Mechanics/spells/faerie-fire.md), [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md), or [daylight](Mechanics/spells/daylight.md). Spell scrolls of each can be found elsewhere in the chapel. If such spells can normally only target an object, an object worn by a character is suitable.  
- A character could also set themselves on fire. If they do, they take `1d6` fire damage at the start of each of their turns.  
- A held or carried light source, such as a torch, candle, or lantern doesn't fulfill the requirements.  
- A character can attempt to lift or drag the sceptre, or move it using suitable magic (as long as the magic can lift objects weighing over seven hundred fifty pounds)  
- A character who lights the candles and the pyre in the room, then speaks a prayer of the Sacred Flame before the statue becomes illuminated, shedding bright light in a ten foot radius for one hour.  
- A bard, cleric, druid, or paladin can spend a short rest to attune to the sceptre. If the characters do so, this is the perfect moment for a faction strike team to arrive!  

> [!note] Developments
> 
> **When the characters** return with the [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md), they are rewarded with a faction boon. An uncommon magic item from the respective faction is appropriate, plus either several consumable items or a payment of 250 gold per player character.
> 
> - Characters working for the Silver Order are invited to Camp Dawn to meet [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md), and characters working for the Falling Fire are invited to meet [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) at Champion's Gate. The faction leaders thank the characters for retrieving a valuable relic, and implore them to pledge their faith and service to their factions before turning the characters back over to a faction lieutenant for further instructions.  
> - If [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) takes a liking to the characters, he might arrange to set them up with mounts from the stables.  
> - Characters who impress [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) and show genuine interest in joining her faith might be invited to keep the *Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio*. She won't yet invite them to take the Sacrament of the Falling Fire, but foresees a great destiny for them.

> 
> How the characters dealt with the other faction agents encountered during this adventure could potentially influence future interactions with those factions. It's possible the characters use guile, negotiation, and stealth to navigate this scenario without making enemies. If the characters slay all the members of a strike team, there might not be anyone who can actually report back to identify that the characters were the ones responsible. Nevertheless, if faction members survive and escape, or evidence emerges implicating the characters, it could potentially sour future interactions. However, the factions still regard the characters as neutral mercenaries at this stage of the campaign. Faction agents clash with adventurers all the time in the ruins, so becoming outright enemies of either faction should only occur if the characters incite serious altercations and violence by keeping the sceptre for themselves. If they simply retrieve and return the sceptre to whichever faction hired them, it arises ire from the other factions, but not retribution.
> 
> Characters who decide to keep the sceptre become a target for both the Followers of the Falling Fire and the Knights of the Silver Order. Both factions entreat the characters to turn the sceptre over to them, offering rewards in exchange. However, if the characters don't accept these offers, the factions dispatch strike teams to attack them. The first strike team sent won't be ordered to slay the characters, but they will rough them up badly and take the scepter. If this strike team is defeated or killed, the characters might risk further escalation with one of the factions. Characters who incur the ire of the Silver Order or the Falling Fire then turn the sceptre over to one of the other factions, have made an enemy of that faction.

## Eckerman Mill

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Eckerman Mill is a dilapidated windmill that rests atop a lonely hill northwest of Drakkenheim. Its stone base is covered in moss and ivy, and the rotting wooden walls are riddled with holes. The entire structure creaks in the wind. The windmill blades still spin softly in the breeze, but the machinery within is damaged beyond repair and the millstone no longer turns. Scattered about the mill are the leftovers from countless expeditions. A well-used bonfire pit surrounded by a few well-worn logs for seating and several tattered tents are set up beside the mill. Abandoned here are a few bedrolls, battered cookware, a rusty chopping axe, and a waterlogged stack of wood.
^2df

- The Mill is often used as a meeting place for adventurers venturing into Drakkenheim from the northwestern side of the Drann River. Since Emberwood Village lies several miles to the south on the opposite side of the river, many use Eckerman Mill as a makeshift campsite as it is much closer to the city proper.  
- Occasionally, faction agents who wish to avoid the eyes and ears of Emberwood Village arrange clandestine meetings here. In particular, the location is favoured by field surveyors dispatched by the Amethyst Academy.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/061-05-010.eckerman-mill.webp#center)

### Mill Graffiti

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mill is scrawled over with chalk graffiti and carvings, transforming the walls into an impromptu message board. There are several roughly engraved messages along the walls. Most list the names of dozens of would-be heroes who have ventured into the ruins, though many names are crossed out to mark those who did not return. Curiously, a few groups have not marked off a single casualty... perhaps they all made it out alive, or more likely, none survived. In addition to these memorials, along the wall one can find many dire warnings, cryptic riddles, poignant questions, crude maps to alleged treasure, and amateur drawings of horrible monsters encountered in the ruins.
^2e1

- Invite your player characters to write their own messages or names on the walls of Eckerman Mill, to follow the tradition of those who came before.  
- You can distribute one rumour to characters who examine the writings of Eckerman Mill to represent what they learn from reading the scrawled messages and riddles on the walls.

> This mill used to be my favourite stomping ground, now it's full of names of those who died. I gotta say, the novelty is wearing off quick.

## Rat's Nest Tavern

> [!quote]  
> 
> My colleagues have an experiment in mind that requires a large delerium crystal. Smaller shards won't suffice. Unfortunately, such specimens are quite rare in the Outer City ruins. However, we've got a lead...

A small chunk of the meteor broke off and crashed into the Rat's Nest Tavern in the Sprawl, utterly destroying most of the building. However, an intact delerium crystal was left behind. Unfortunately, a [ratling](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) colony has created a burrow under the taphouse basement and moved the meteorite into their warrens. The ratlings have grown bold enough to launch raids throughout the ruins and take several captives in the process.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/062-05-012.rat-nest-tavern.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, the characters travel to the Rat's Nest Tavern to obtain a delerium crystal or rescue a captive prisoner. How the characters accomplish either is up to them: they can fight, sneak past, or trick the ratlings, but the creatures will viciously defend their lair by responding with ambushes and traps of their own.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Good Prospects

(Amethyst Academy) River contacts the characters for a clandestine meeting. She wants them to retrieve a delerium crystal from the Rat's Nest. A crystal of this size is normally worth about 1,000 gp, but she offers to pay 1,250 gp for it.

- River's intel is based on rumours the tavern was destroyed by a breakaway piece of the original meteor. Since her intel is based on speculation, she offers the characters a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) each as an advance in the event that the characters turn up nothing.  
- River cannot disclose the nature of the experiment:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Your continued discretion ensures continued employment."
^2e6

##### Missing in Action

(Hooded Lanterns) [Ansom Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) approaches the characters in Emberwood Village. His sister, [Petra Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md), was captured when ratlings ambushed them during a supply run last night. He needs the characters to rescue Petra before it's too late. He offers 250 gold pieces as a reward for her safe return.

- Against orders to retreat, Ansom tracked the ratlings to the Rat's Nest. He was driven off when the ratlings wounded him with a contaminated sling bullet. Ansom explains that ratlings often keep prisoners to have a "fresh meal" later. He's positive Petra is still alive.  
- Ansom warns the characters about the dangers of contamination. He can't help the characters personally as he's recovering from contamination himself. He advises them that if they get contaminated in the ruins, Flamekeeper Hanna in Emberwood Village can help them with her magic.  
- Finally, he promises to put in a good word with the Lord Commander for the characters' help. However, he emphasises this is a personal job - he's already risking insubordination:  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Amongst the Hooded Lanterns, our survival doctrine says we don't risk lives on 'futile' rescue attempts. We all knew the dangers when we signed up, but she's my sister."
^2e8

### Interactions

For the most part, the ratlings in the burrow are hostile to trespassers of any sort. They know who lives in the burrow and who does not, and can recognize each other by scent. They lure intruders into traps or ambushes where the ratlings can use their numbers to their advantage. The ratlings are most active at night, when two-thirds leave the burrow on foraging raids. During the daylight hours, most ratlings are sleeping in their dens except for a few sentries.

#### The Rat Prince

The ratlings in the burrow are led by a large and ferocious ratling who self-styles himself as the [Rat Prince](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/rat-prince-dodk.md). He rules because he's the biggest, strongest, and killed the last ratling who called themselves the Rat Prince. He believes once his colony has enough food, they will be able to grow large and multiply. Then all the other ratlings will bow down to him for sure!

- **Personality Trait.** The Rat Prince bullies the others like a despot. When speaking, the Rat Prince repeats words two or three times for emphasis. "Yes yes yes..."  
- **Ideal.** The Rat Prince loves killing, eating, breeding, and sleeping. Pretty much in that order.  
- **Bond.** The Rat Prince wears a makeshift crown and claims he's the ruler of all the ratlings in Drakkenheim. This is far from true, but good luck convincing the Rat Prince otherwise.  
- **Flaw.** Logic makes the Rat Prince confused and angry, unless that logic involves food.  

Caught alone, the Rat Prince flees or begs for his life, offering anything he can think of to convince characters to let him go free.

#### Squeaks the Seer

This albino ratling [warlock of the rat god](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/warlock-of-the-rat-god-dodk.md) is the spiritual leader of the colony.

- **Personality Trait.** She makes up fantastic stories about the Rat God's wrath and cunning.  
- **Ideal.** The Rat God wants ratlings to eat everything they can. It gave her magic powers to help the ratlings get food and get the "shiny" (delerium). One day it will eat the world. The other ratlings all think this sounds fantastic.  
- **Bond.** She thinks collecting the shiny (delerium) pleases the Rat God, and leads cannibalistic rituals in its name. Ratlings love eating, so they love these rituals.  
- **Flaw.** She thinks she can talk to the Rat God through the delerium crystal. She keeps the stone in her lair (Area 8) and becomes enraged if other ratlings touch it.  

#### Befriending the Ratlings

In the original *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* campaign, the Rat Prince surrendered to my player characters. Using deception to convince the Rat Prince they were ghosts dispatched by the Rat God, the Rat Prince befriended the characters and became a recurring NPC. The player characters continued to protect and hide the ratlings, but once the gnolls were driven out of the city, nothing was holding back a growing ratling population. Left completely unchecked, their numbers swelled to gargantuan proportions that threatened to overtake the entire city!

#### Scrag Lane

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Rat's Nest Tavern lies on the mud-slick and rubble-strewn Scrag Lane south of Shepherd's Way, nestled between ramshackle tenements and crumbling flats. The original tavern has been almost entirely obliterated, and the neighbouring buildings are heavily damaged. What remains are stone foundations piled with debris. The first-floor walls stand about chest high, a few supporting timbers splayed outward like a burst ribcage. The rooftop and upper levels have entirely collapsed into a mist-covered crater filled with rubble. The original tavern sign juts out obliquely from a building on the opposite side of the street. It is engraved with a smiling, obese rat laying on a plate of food.
^2ef

- Characters who search the streets for nearby sewer entrances may discover the hidden entrance to the ratling burrow through the sewers.  

#### Taproom Ruins

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Inside what remains of the tavern walls, the wooden floorboards of the ground level have almost entirely collapsed into a large gaping hole. Tumbled brick piles, ashen cinders, burned shingles, splintered wooden planks, support beams, fractured furniture, cracked mugs, broken glass, random bits of bone and cutlery are scattered everywhere.
^2f1

- The hole opens to the basement ten feet below.  
- [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival) (DC 10). Animal-like scratchings, gnaw marks, patches of coarse fur, muddy tracks, and rat droppings may be found by examining the area.  

#### [1] Cratered Basement

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stone walls of the basement are scorched and blackened. Rubble and debris surround a muddy crater fifteen feet wide and five feet deep. A faint glimmer of octarine light twinkles within.
^2f3

- Examining the crater for the source of the glow turns up `1d6` delerium chips (worth 10 gold each). There's a distinct rocky divot about a foot wide just off the centre of the crater, as if a large hunk of rock was dug out and excavated. If there was a meteorite here, it's gone now.  
- The ratlings removed a chunk of rock fused with a delerium crystal from the crater and dragged it into the Seer's Den (Area 8). A [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival) (DC 10) check reveals drag marks, muddy tracks, and clawed footprints of several beastly creatures indicating something heavy was removed from the crater recently.  
- [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) (DC 10), or proficiency with mason's tools/stone working. The breached wall was not caused by the meteor impact. The passage was dug relatively recently.  

#### Ratling Burrow

These details are common to most areas within the ratling burrows:

##### Passages

The tunnelsare dug out from packed earth, clay, loose dirt, and bits of stone. The cramped passages are five to ten feet wide, and rarely more than six feet high. Medium-sized creatures must stoop throughout. The tunnels weave and bend left and right, but also up and down.

##### Chambers

The larger rooms are eight to ten feet in height. They are mostly dry past the entrance, but unrecognizable filth, bone fragments, scraps of fur and cloth, and bits of leaves and grasses lay underfoot.

##### Light

The ratlings rely on their [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) for sight, so there are no light sources within.

##### Sounds and Smells

The air underground is humid. It reeks of rat urine and feces. The sounds of squeaking and chattering ratlings as they scrape and scurry about can be heard down the tunnels.

#### [2] Trapped Entrance Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This muddy passage is roughly eight feet wide. It tunnels steeply down ten feet before veering sharply left.
^2fa

- **[Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) (DC 10).** The wet mud is slippery, and could lead to a nasty fall.  

##### Mudslide Trap

Characters without a climbing speed travelling down the entrance passage must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or slip on the muddy slide. Characters using a rope gain advantage on the saving throw. Characters who fail this save fall [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) and immediately slide down the passage, where they are deposited onto the **pit trap** in the Lookout's Burrow (Area 3).

#### [3] Lookout's Burrow

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The sound of soft rustling and chittering rats fills this muddy earthen den.
^2fd

- 2 [ratling guttersnipes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) and 6 [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) are on watch. Each carries a crossbow and a few prepared [flasks of alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md).  

##### Pit Trap

A spiked pit trap ten feet deep is dug in the ground at the base of the Trapped Entrance Passage (Area 2). The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit's edge and camouflaged with mud and debris. [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) (DC 10) spots the pit. Anyone who moves onto the cloth falls into the pit onto the sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom, and takes 5 (`2d4`) piercing damage from the spikes, and 5 (`1d10`) damage from the fall. The edges of the pit are slippery, making escape difficult. Climbing out requires a DC 10 [Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics) check. A creature who fails by 5 or more falls back onto the spikes.

- A [swarm of rats](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md) lives at the bottom of the pit, and begins devouring anyone who falls within. The swarm attacks any creature in the pit as food.  

#### [4] Ratling Nests

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This tiny dugout cavity contains a cup-shaped nest made from long grasses, hay, mud, twigs, and leaves, and is lined with shredded bits of discarded cloth, fur scraps, bits of leather, paper, and small glimmering trinkets.
^300

- 8 [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) and 1 [ratling guttersnipe](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) are present in each nest cluster, scattered across the individual nest cavities.  
- Ratlings hoard small trinkets as personal treasure, plus a delerium sliver or a pouch of 10 (`3d6`) gold. One nest contains a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).  

#### [5] Food Caches

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Haphazardly splayed about this rancid-smelling den are all manner of recently-scavenged dead animals, body parts, and other unsavoury stores.
^302

- Living meat stays well-preserved, so occasionally prisoners are tied up here for a fresh meal later.  
- Treasure. The north cache contains [thieves' tools](Mechanics/items/thieves-tools.md), a [poisoner's kit](Mechanics/items/poisoners-kit.md), an [herbalism kit](Mechanics/items/herbalism-kit.md), [alchemist's supplies](Mechanics/items/alchemists-supplies.md), and two [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).  
- The south cache holds a still-living captive prisoner - [Petra Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) of the Hooded Lanterns. She is unarmed, wounded (with 20 hp remaining), and has expended all her spell slots. However, she's willing to help fight her way out if provided a weapon. Characters can recognize her as a Hooded Lantern lieutenant by her cloak and garb. If she survives, she asks the characters to help her get back to Shepherd's Gate. She can make the trip on her own, but wants the characters to meet her comrades.  

#### [6] Idol of the Rat God

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber contains a bloated effigy of a horrifically obese demonic rat made from rubble, mud, and rat feces, set with two pieces of delerium for eyes. Offerings are scattered about the statue's feet—skulls, bone, daggers, bits of rotting meat, and smaller delerium fragments. Before it lies a blood-soaked altar made from a simple stone slab.
^304

- 6 [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) attend the shrine. They flee for help if intruders arrive here.  
- Treasure. The eyes of the idol are delerium fragments (worth 100 gold each). `1d6` delerium chips are scattered about the altar. Several [scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) are placed at the altar here—[bane](Mechanics/spells/bane.md), [faerie fire](Mechanics/spells/faerie-fire.md), and [inflict wounds](Mechanics/spells/inflict-wounds.md).  

#### [7] Gathering Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Bales of hay and animal skins surround a glowing bonfire in this large foetid chamber.
^306

- The Rat Prince is often found here carousing with six other [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md).  
- The ratlings meet here to discuss their nefarious and ill-conceived plans. There are several sets of tools in this room—including [tinker's tools](Mechanics/items/tinkers-tools.md) and [alchemist's tools](Mechanics/items/alchemists-supplies.md), which the ratlings use to create makeshift weapons and improvised explosives.  
- This burrow tunnel opens into the sewers. The ratlings flee here and scatter if they are wounded or cannot defend their lair.  

#### [8] Seer's Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In this spacious chamber is a large and sumptuous basket nest. Woven over the nest is a canvas made from stitched together scraps of fine cloth, twigs, and choice leaves. Before the nest is a rough stone plinth upon which is placed a hunk of silvery rock about a foot wide. A protruding delerium crystal is embedded in its surface.
^308

- Squeaks the Seer keeps her nest here. She has an [imp](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) familiar who remains in rat form. In its true form, it resembles a disgusting winged and hairless rat.  
- The delerium crystal is here. It's still stuck in a rocky chunk: a combination of stone from the tavern basement, melted earth, and meteoric rock. The Ratlings dislodged it and brought it here because they couldn't break the crystal from the rock themselves. The chunk of rock weighs about fifty pounds.

> **The Delerium Crystal.** River upholds her end of the bargain faithfully. If the characters were swift and professional in their dealings with her, she gives them a single dose of [aqua delerium](Mechanics/items/aqua-delerium-dodk.md) as an additional reward. She encourages them to take a few days off to recuperate, promising to contact them shortly (in `1d6` days) with another job. On the other hand, River is much less impressed if the characters fail to recover the delerium crystal. She still offers to buy any found delerium from the characters, but decides to wait and reassess the characters' capabilities before offering them further work.
> 
> Characters who aren't already in contact with the Amethyst Academy still have a valuable find on their hands, which could put them in contact with any faction. The Hooded Lanterns know the delerium crystal is worth a small fortune, but they're happy to let the characters keep it as an extra reward for their efforts. Ansom or Petra could suggest the characters sell the crystal in Emberwood Village to Fairweather Trades and Exports. Another NPC might suggest the characters ask around the village for contacts with the Amethyst Academy or the Queen's Men to sell the crystal to them. Alternatively, the characters might encounter a knight of the Silver Order, who encourages the characters to destroy the delerium. Finally, a pilgrim of the Falling Fire may claim the crystal has a holy purpose, and try to convince the characters to bring it to Lucretia Mathias at Saint Selina's Monastery as an offering.
> 
> **Rescuing Petra Lang.** If Petra Lang survives, she invites the characters to return with her to Shepherd's Gate. Her comrades are thrilled at her safe return, and Lord Commander Elias Drexel takes note of the characters. He won't meet them personally just yet, but instead makes arrangements for Ansom or Petra to contact them for another mission within 7 (`2d6`) days.
> 
> Ansom reminds the characters that their arrangement was a personal matter, and technically not official Hooded Lanterns business. As such, this mission alone won't earn the characters free passage through Shepherd's Gate. However, should the characters come to the gate in an emergency, the Hooded Lanterns will help them. In such an event, they'll overlook the tariffs "just this one time" and let them through.
> 
> If the characters fail to rescue Petra, Ansom believes them to be utterly incompetent. He hesitates to involve them further in Hooded Lanterns affairs, and bitterly mistrusts their capabilities in any future situations.
> 
> If Petra dies, but the characters weren't yet working with the Hooded Lanterns, it's up to them whether or not they reveal her fate. Regardless, her comrades are shaken by her disappearance and death. In grief, the hard-hearted Lord Commander never speaks of her again. Ansom presses on, but it feels like he's missing a part of himself.

## Reed Manor

> [!quote] A quote from River  
> 
> Oscar Yoren had irreconcilable differences with the Academy. I'm not privy to all the details, but the Directorate cut support for his research. When Yoren absconded with several volumes on conjuration, transmutation, and necromancy, we discovered he'd taken up unsavoury methods for acquiring "raw materials'' instead. He was declared malfeasant, and sought refuge in Drakkenheim. He's survived in the city ruins for about a decade since. We don't understand how he has managed to do so, but we want to find out. He knows something about the Haze.

Reed Manor stands in a now-dilapidated upper-class residential neighbourhood on the north side of Drakkenheim, just off College Road. The fate of the original occupants is unknown, but it is now occupied by the malfeasant wizard [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md) and his apprentices.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/065-05-013.reed-manor.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, the characters encounter [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md). Yoren has developed valuable research about the Haze and delerium, but the mage is not necessarily willing to share his discoveries freely. Most notably, Yoren has developed a formula for brewing [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), a potion that offers protection from contamination. Characters must decide how they'll deal with Oscar Yoren: they may bargain with him to obtain his research, steal his work through stealth and trickery, or attack the mage and destroy his experiments. Depending on the characters' actions, Oscar Yoren could become a recurring character in the campaign.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Stolen Homework

River hires the characters to obtain Oscar Yoren's Research. She offers the characters a reward of 250 gold, and one magic item crafted by the Amethyst Academy—a [pearl of power](Mechanics/items/pearl-of-power.md) made from a delerium shard.

- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "We located Oscar Yoren by trailing a group of expelled students who sought him out. They may be working as his apprentices now."  
    ^310  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "We don't care what you have to do to obtain this information, but you must bring back something tangible: a spellbook, his journals, or samples of his work. In the worst case scenario... all we require is his brain."  
    ^311  

#### Potions Inspectors

> [!quote] A quote from Petra Lang  
> 
> For several years now, we've been buying potions from a man named Oscar Yoren. He's a bit of a strange recluse, but his work is reliable and he doesn't seem to be bothering anyone. His potions are much cheaper than what the Amethyst Academy charges. Normally, he sends one of his apprentices to Shepherd's Gate every Monday with a new shipment, but they didn't arrive last week. The week before we got half the normal order. Worse, we've discovered that several of the potions we previously received simply didn't work, and a few were even contaminated. Something's going on, and we'd like you to investigate.

Lieutenant Petra Lang (or Ansom Lang) contacts the characters in Emberwood Village. She offers the characters 250 gold pieces for the task. Furthermore, the Hooded Lanterns will offer characters a weapon from their stockpile: either a [+1 longsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) or a [+1 longbow](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md).

- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "Our past dealings with Yoren have generally been positive, but it's possible that he cleans up his operation whenever we come around to check on him."  
    ^313  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "We're worried about these faulty and contaminated potions, and we need you to make sure Oscar Yoren isn't cutting corners."  
    ^314  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "However, if something happened to him, we need to know. We still need Oscar Yoren's potions. We don't have access to a lot of our own magic, and we're stretched pretty thin right now, especially with several sick Lanterns."  
    ^315  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "He lives in an old house on the north end of town, I guess he uses some kind of magic to keep himself healthy. We think he might have been kicked out of the Amethyst Academy, but that's their business, not ours."  
    ^316  

If the player characters don't take this mission, Petra dispatches a group of [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) instead. They show up while the characters are exploring the manor.

#### The Buyout

> [!quote] A quote from Blackjack Mel  
> 
> The greencloaks have a supplier who's been making potions for 'em at a pretty steep discount. He's some sort of cast-off from the Academy. A guy like that can be a valuable asset... my employer would like to acquire this asset. That's where you come in. Make him an offer he can't refuse.

Blackjack Mel invites the characters to meet him at the Skull & Sword Taphouse in Emberwood Village. He wants the characters to convince Oscar Yoren to break ties with the Hooded Lanterns and start providing potions for the Queen's Men instead. He offers the characters 250 gold as payment, plus some "fancy new shoes"—[boots of striding and springing](Mechanics/items/boots-of-striding-and-springing.md).

- > [!readaloud]

    ^318  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > "We want the same price he's giving the greencloaks, but he has to cut them off. As long as he delivers the goods, the Queen of Thieves can provide all the protection he needs. If he refuses, we'll break his legs and steal his work."  
    ^319  

### Interactions

#### Oscar Yoren

This malfeasant wizard fled the Amethyst Academy ten years ago. Oscar Yoren has since taken up residence on the north side of Drakkenheim in Reed Manor, and survived on the outskirts of the city through his grim intellect, ruthless self-interest, and willingness to practice unsavoury forms of alchemy and necromancy. Several other outcast mages have since joined him as apprentices. See Reed Manor for details on Oscar Yoren's discoveries with delerium.

Oscar Yoren is a short, wide man in his mid-fifties. He wears slovenly leather breeches and a filthy black overcoat. He has shoulder-length greasy black hair and a thick beard of wiry unshaven hair creeping down his flabby neck. His skin is covered in sores and pasty blotches, with bulging blood veins under his neck. His sunken bloodshot eyes glare with a purple-green light. He has yellow teeth and fingernails.

- **Personality Trait.** I talk down to anyone who isn't as intelligent as I am - which is everyone. I demand attention when I'm speaking, and make thinly-veiled threats when I don't get my way.  
- **Ideal.** The Amethyst Academy doesn't understand my methods, but I cannot unlock the secrets of delerium if I am hindered by petty morality and useless ethics. If I had proper facilities and resources, unimaginable power would be mine.  
- **Bond.** My apprentices are useful as long as they are loyal and don't question me, but disposable the moment they aren't. Only my own survival matters.  
- **Flaw.** I hold vindictive grudges against everyone who ever wronged me. I'll have my revenge someday, but I fear acting against those with more power or resources than me. I must hide for now, as I'm terrified the Academy will send assassins to kill me and steal my brilliant research.  

[Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md) uses the game statistics of a human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). He has [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) 60 ft, 72 hit points, and resistance to necrotic and poison damage. He has the following spells prepared:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Cantrips (at will) - [chill touch](Mechanics/spells/chill-touch.md), [mage hand](Mechanics/spells/mage-hand.md), [ray of frost](Mechanics/spells/ray-of-frost.md)
> 
> 1st level (4 slots) - [false life](Mechanics/spells/false-life.md), [mage armor](Mechanics/spells/mage-armor.md), [magic missile](Mechanics/spells/magic-missile.md), [shield](Mechanics/spells/shield.md)
> 
> 2nd level (3 slots) - [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md), [misty step](Mechanics/spells/misty-step.md), [web](Mechanics/spells/web.md)

> 
> 5th level (1 slot) - [cloudkill](Mechanics/spells/cloudkill.md)
^31c

Oscar Yoren's [spellbook](Mechanics/items/spellbook.md) contains all the spells he has prepared, plus [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md), [find familiar](Mechanics/spells/find-familiar.md), [glyph of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md), [contact other plane](Mechanics/spells/contact-other-plane.md), [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md), [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md), [magic circle](Mechanics/spells/magic-circle.md), and [planar binding](Mechanics/spells/planar-binding.md).

Thanks to long-term gradual exposure to contamination over the past decade, Oscar Yoren and his apprentices have gained a limited resistance to the Haze. They aren't immune to contamination, but they may rest in Drakkenheim normally. Oscar Yoren is working on how to reproduce these results, but his current method requires several years of risky and intense self-exposure to delerium.

Oscar Yoren and his apprentices are secretive, but not outwardly hostile if characters approach them peacefully. Instead, the apprentices offer to sell the characters potions. They admit characters into the dining room to talk, but not further into the manor. The apprentices do business in a curt yet cordial manner (see "Potion Brewery" below).

When he meets with the characters personally, Oscar Yoren bluntly demands to know who sent them. He staunchly refuses to work with anyone who admits to working with the Amethyst Academy or the Silver Order, and asks them firmly to leave. Otherwise, he sees an opportunity. He plans to use the characters to recover delerium, monster parts, and arcane reagents for him so he can advance his research, and then conveniently dispose of them once they become troublesome.

Oscar Yoren uses his research as leverage, revealing some of his discoveries about delerium as proof of his knowledge (see the sidebar on "Oscar Yoren's Research"). In exchange for ensuring his freedom, sparing his life, and making fair payment in coin and delerium, he offers to create [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md) for the characters. He overstates the efficacy of [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), but does not reveal its side effects. He scoffs at the idea that anyone else could create the potion. Yoren does not willingly give up his writings or formulas under any circumstances. Instead, he lies, claiming the most important secrets are "in his head."

If the characters agree to work with him, he explains that eldritch lilies are needed to create the potion, and that the plants may only be found in Queen's Park (see chapter 7). If the characters return with the flowers, he makes good on his end of the deal as long as he is paid and unmolested.

Oscar Yoren is ambivalent about working for either the Queen of Thieves or the Hooded Lanterns, but explains that he's devoting all his attention to his new research. He's only interested in continuing to work with either if they're willing to cough up extra money and muscle to help him make more [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md).

##### Potion Brewery

Oscar Yoren and his apprentices brew and sell magical potions to fund their work. They sell uncommon and rare potions for twenty five percent off the normal price. Most of their potions are cheaply made with contaminated ingredients. When consumed, roll ``. On a one, the creature consuming the potion gains one level of contamination. If provided the right ingredients, they can also create [aqua delerium](Mechanics/items/aqua-delerium-dodk.md) and [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md) (see Appendix D).

##### Yoren's Apprentices

Several expelled Academy students have since joined him as apprentices: Marco, Gemma, Taryn, and Bolter. Each is a [hedge mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md) and has a familiar: a [bat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/bat.md), a [cat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/cat.md), an [owl](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/owl.md), and a [rat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rat.md), respectively.

#### [1] Manor Grounds

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Reed Manor is a run-down two-storey stone house surrounded by a rusting wrought-iron fence and an overgrown yard filled with shrubberies and brambles. The long, thin windows are boarded over from the outside, but light flickers within the first floor. Several chimneys rise up from the slate-shingle rooftop, a light trail of smoke billowing from each. A collapsed small outbuilding, perhaps once a stable or shed, borders the yard. Sweeping around the estate grounds, there are two doors leading into the manor from the back. Both have been nailed shut with rotting planks.
> 
> A short cobblestone pathway leads through the yard up to a small set of steps leading to the central double doors. A large, round iron knocker hangs on each. Before the doors is a fountain. The central decorative statue has crumbled away into the basin, which is filled with brackish rainwater and algae. A singular obese toad basks beside the water, croaking loudly.
^321

- There is a secret entrance to the lower level hidden in the bushes. Any physical inspection within five feet discovers it, but it's sealed with an [arcane lock](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell.  

#### Groundskeepers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Outside the manor are two hulking figures wearing heavy brown overcoats, and both have hoods drawn up over their bandaged faces. One stands listlessly at the front gate, while the other lumbers in a patrol around the manor grounds.
^323

- A pair of [ogre zombies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ogre-zombie.md) patrol the grounds. One stands at the gate. If approached, they lurch around and growl "What... you... want..." then wait for a reply.  
- The zombies respond to any mention of "potions" by replying "follow... this... way..." and escort characters to the front door. They knock loudly three times, which signals Marco and Gemma to answer the door and talk business.  
- Otherwise, the zombies reply "You... not... welcome... here... go... away..."  
- After issuing the warning, the zombies attack one round later unless they are ordered to stand down by Oscar Yoren or one of his apprentices. They're ordered to cry out loudly when they do, which automatically alerts the manor occupants that something is amiss. The zombies only leave the manor grounds to pursue a foe making ranged attacks against them.  
- The toad is Yoren's [quasit](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md) familiar, Drovik. If it detects trouble, it swims down the fountain pipes to alert Oscar.  

#### [2-8] Manor House

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **[2] Entrance Foyer.** This once well-appointed foyer is covered in leaves and mud tracked in from the city streets. A decaying tapestry depicting the Reed Family Crest hangs along the walls.
^325

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **[3] Alchemical Workshop.** What was once a sitting room is now a makeshift alchemist's workshop. Furniture draped in dust-covered cloth has been pushed aside to make space for two crowded tables set with alembics, burners, distillers, and other equipment for brewing potions. A bubbling cauldron hangs in the fireplace. Strings of herbs dangle from the ceiling, and jars of ingredients are scattered about the shelves alongside racks of empty or half-filled vials. An acrid scent fills the room.
^327

- Marco, Bolter, Gemma, and Taryn work here during the day.  
- Treasure. Enough tools to assemble an [herbalist's kit](Mechanics/items/herbalism-kit.md), a [poisoner's kit](Mechanics/items/poisoners-kit.md), and [alchemical supplies](Mechanics/items/alchemists-supplies.md) can be scavenged from the equipment here. The array of raw materials are suitable for spells or other concoctions worth 250 gold total. The cauldron contains enough liquid to fill `1d6` [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **[4] Study.** This room smells of moldy books. A mahogany desk in one corner is covered in crumpled paper and open books, with a torn velvet armchair set before it. The two candelabras don't look like they've been lit in ages. Tall bookshelves are packed with tomes, statues of a variety of fantastic creatures, and the odd portrait or knick-knack. Sliding wooden ladders mounted on rails allow easy access to higher shelves.
^329

- Most of the books are ruined, but some remain in decent condition.  
- DC 10 [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation). There are signs of traffic in this room despite the disuse. A clear pathway has been left in the room, allowing access to the far bookshelf.  
- Any physical inspection of the bookshelf reveals that it slides open to the north, revealing a staircase to the chambers below.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **[5] Dining Room.** A warm fire burns in the large fireplace, the crackling flames sending the soft smell of wood smoke throughout the room. A black marble mantelpiece above the fireplace has a framed family portrait mounted above it. Lining the wood-paneled walls are broken wooden cabinets that contain cracked dishes, silverware, and empty candlesticks. Iron chandeliers hang from the dark mahogany ceiling above a long dining table carved from redwood. Chairs surround the table, with a tall and elaborate chair at each end. The remains of several meals lie scattered about the table.
^32b

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **[6] Kitchen.** The kitchen is well-stocked and kept in good order, suggesting frequent use. A disgusting stew simmers in a pot on the hearth. Several bottles of rank alcohol are scattered about.
^32d

> [!readaloud] 
>

> Characters might discover the following information or trigger these events after exploring Reed Manor and interacting with Oscar Yoren.

> **Oscar Yoren's Research.** The following information can be uncovered by interrogating Oscar Yoren or reading his writings:
> 
> - **Observations on delerium growth.** "In truth, the crystal is unlike a mineral or gemstone... I have seen the crystals grow like fungus on a dead tree. The process takes some time; weeks, months, years even. I only discovered this by closely observing wild samples near my new home. They do not grow outside the Haze. I wonder if this means there are new delerium deposits in the ruins... perhaps there is more now than when the meteor originally fell."  
> - **Notes on using delerium crystals.** "Just as one cannot make a mast from a thousand saplings, a thousand small shards of delerium are nothing compared to a single large geode. Bigger crystals contain exponentially more arcane power. Fracturing the rock is a wasteful endeavor, as it causes valuable samples to lose their great magical potential. Delerium crystals and geodes are ideally suited for great spells and ambitious magical constructions. However, it has been difficult to find these specimens in the outer ruins. Nevertheless, small twigs are good for kindling, to set a fire, to keep one warm... and so the small shards make excellent alchemical reagents and arcane inks."  
> - **On the alchemical properties of Haze-grown flora.** "The warping effects of delerium have caused new plants and animals to flourish in the city. A half-mad straggler returned from Queen's Park bearing a wondrous flower - an eldritch lily. The pollen and petals soak in contamination to fuel its own germination. Combined with other rare ingredients, I believe it may prove an ideal remedy against contamination."  
> - **Aqua expurgo formula.** Oscar Yoren has developed a formula for *aqua expurgo*, a magical potion that protects against contamination. However, it requires eldritch lilies from Queen's Park Garden. He needs more samples to refine the formula before he can start producing doses of the potion.  
> 
> Oscar Yoren's research is extremely valuable. Chief amongst them is his formula for *aqua expurgo*. This potent defense against the Haze will permit characters to explore much more dangerous areas in the city. The Hooded Lanterns, Queen's Men, and Amethyst Academy would deeply desire this new potion so they can advance their plans inside Drakkenheim.
> 
> The player characters themselves can study Oscar Yoren's research. Any character capable of casting 3rd level spells or higher can learn to make [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md) themselves (see the magic items section for details). However, a key ingredient for the potion is an eldritch lily, which only blooms in Queen's Park. If characters want to create this potion, they'll need to mount an expedition to the Inner City to collect this key ingredient.
> 
> - If the Amethyst Academy obtains the formula, they'll begin producing the potion on a periodic basis. The main constraint is the supply of eldritch lilies. This prevents the Amethyst Academy from manufacturing vast quantities of *aqua expurgo*. They'll ask characters to obtain samples, and if possible, seeds or full plants. This way they can attempt to cultivate the flower themselves.  
> - The Hooded Lanterns might suggest turning over the research to the Amethyst Academy as a possible inroad to an alliance. They're also willing to work with Oscar Yoren and continue providing him with protection and materials.

## Shrine of Morrigan

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> North of Castle Drakken lies a forested ravine known as the Overlook. Deep within these woods lies a copse of verdant trees caught in a persistent autumnal state. Bone-chimes hang from the gnarled branches of blood-red leaves, and even the tree bark is a vibrant crimson-brown. A small clearing lies at the heart of the grove, where five ancient menhir stones decorated in spiralling patterns form a semicircle around an altar of stone stained with ancient blood. Opposite is a barrow mound carved from the rock.
^33d

- This is the Shrine of Morrigan, a place dedicated to an ancient and shadowy old god. Also known as the Phantom Queen, this elusive entity revels in war and trickery, and holds power over life and death.  

### Overview

Few in Drakkenheim have the power to return the dead to life. Characters who do not have the ability to revive the dead by their own ability must seek out alternative solutions. The Shrine of Morrigan is one such place.

#### Adventure Hook

##### Raise the Fallen

In the event a player character dies in the ruins, Old Zoya, Elias Drexel, the Queen of Thieves, and Eldrick Runeweaver could suggest characters seek out the shrine. Their information is limited to rumours and legends:

- Rumours tell of an old hermit who dwells in the wooded ravine north of Castle Drakken.  
- The elf is apparently a priest of some sort, and serves an old god of life and death.  
- He can perform a ritual that brings back the dead, but it bears a terrible blood price.

#### Life Trade

If characters inquire about returning the dead to life, he explains that such a feat is possible for him, but the price is high indeed:

- Morrigan is a covetous deity. In order to cast [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md), his god demands a living sacrifice. However, not any life will do: it must be a humanoid creature with a level or challenge rating equal to or higher than the character who will be resurrected.  
- In addition, a diamond is needed. Delerium could be used as a substitute, but any creature revived using delerium as a material component gains one randomly determined form of Drakkenheim Madness (see Appendix C).  
- Finally, the hermit demands an offering to satisfy himself. Company, a great story, an act of service, a magic item, fine wine - basically, give him a nice gift that would please a grandfather.  

## Smithy on the Scar

> [!quote] A quote from Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal  
> 
> We can not allow these mining operations to continue. They are funneling these dangerous rocks out of the city and sending them all over Westemär and beyond. We need to stop the spread of this corruption before it's too late.

South of the city walls lies an industrial neighborhood known as the Spokes. The region was heavily damaged during the meteor shower, and a large trench cuts through the district. Nicknamed the "Scar", this rough ravine was created by a massive boulder ejected from the initial meteor impact that collided with the walls and ricocheted south. This rogue projectile tore open the ground and levelled many buildings as it skid across the city, only narrowly missing the Spokes Smithy.

This once-humble smithy has been transformed into a fortified mining camp by an intrepid and entrepreneurial family of dwarven prospectors. The four Ironhelm siblings arrived in Drakkenheim a few months ago, and used their wondrous mechanical weaponry to lay claim to the rich deposits of delerium found within the Scar. While this has made them one of the most successful delerium extraction teams in Drakkenheim, they've made a loose agreement with the Queen of Thieves for protection, and now find themselves caught in the crosshairs of all five factions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/070-05-016.smithy.webp#center)

### Overview

In this adventure, one or more of the factions dispatch the player characters to deal with the Ironhelm dwarves. Each faction has different goals here, so the party may be asked to drive off the dwarves or negotiate with them. Regardless, it's up to the player characters to decide how exactly to carry out these orders: they might offer their assistance to the dwarves, attack them, trick them, or bargain with them.

#### Adventure Hooks

#### Altering the Deal

> [!quote] A quote from The Queen of Thieves  
> 
> Don't harm one hair in their mangy beards. The miners are as valuable as the delerium itself. Don't break their legs - just break their toys. The dwarves want to know what their money buys them, so show them. You can let them know they owe us twenty percent from here on out.

When the Ironhelms arrived in Drakkenheim, they immediately clashed with the bandit gangs who had previously been picking over the delerium in the Scar. After wresting control of the claim, they cut a deal with the Queen of Thieves: the dwarves could mine the Scar unmolested, so long as they paid fifteen percent of their profits to the Queen of Thieves each week for "protection". However, the Ironhelms have since acquired new weaponry, and no longer feel they need to pay such a large cut for protection that has never actually materialised. The Queen of Thieves is furious, and charges the characters with stealing, sabotaging, or destroying the dwarves' gunpowder weapons to make sure they'll have to depend on her services. However, she doesn't want the dwarves' mining operations otherwise disturbed. Cracking a few skulls and roughing them up is fine, but if multiple dwarves are killed, the characters won't be rewarded.

#### An Exclusive Contract

> [!quote] A quote from River  
> 
> The Ironhelm dwarves extract more delerium than anyone. We just want to put it to good use.

The Amethyst Academy wants to buy every last bit of delerium the Ironhelms collect. River explains they are willing to pay the market rate plus cover all the dwarves' expenses in return. She emphasises that the Ironhelms must cut ties with whoever else they're currently supplying (which would include their contract with the Queen of Thieves). She asks the player characters to approach the Ironhelms about this deal, and find out if the dwarves have any additional conditions or demands. If the characters can see to those demands as well, so much the better.

#### The Hooded Lanterns Offer

> [!quote] A quote from Lord Commander Elias Drexel  
> 
> The dwarves have weaponry, defences, and tactics that we could use to better fortify our camp, and make stronger pushes into the Inner City.

The Hooded Lanterns want to collaborate with the Ironhelms for mutual benefit. If the dwarves are willing to craft guns and weapons for the Hooded Lanterns, the faction is willing to send their soldiers to guard the Spokes Smithy, and let the Ironhelms take up residence with them in Drakkenheim Garrison. Elias Drexel sends the player characters as envoys to negotiate with the Ironhelms and show them the sincerity of their offer. He wants the characters to find out if the dwarves have anything else they want or need to make the deal work.

#### The Silver Order

The Silver Order has resolved to shut down the Ironhelms entirely. Theodore Marshal impresses that he'd rather not see the dwarves killed, but the mining simply must not continue. He charges the characters to convince the Ironhelms to abandon Drakkenheim. If they refuse, the characters must do what is necessary to drive them out: perhaps by destroying their supplies, the smithy fortifications and weapons, or even somehow making the Scar too dangerous for the dwarves to continue mining it. If the characters manage to do so without slaying any of the dwarves, Theodore Marshal promises them an additional boon, but will accept whatever solution the characters invent.

#### The Followers of the Falling Fire

> [!quote] A quote from Lucretia Mathias  
> 
> Our most humble and defenseless pilgrims could readily collect the holy stones found within the Scar. Not only are these dwarves defiling our sacred crystals with their shovels and mining picks, their greed has caused them to murder many innocent faithful.

The Followers of the Falling Fire are aghast at the dwarven strip mine, and want the operation to stop entirely. The delerium in the Scar must instead be put to a sacred purpose. Worse, the dwarves have killed several Falling Fire pilgrims who came to the Scar seeking delerium, as the devotees stubbornly refused to back down when threatened by the Ironhelms. Unfortunately, the dwarven guns are simply too much for their pilgrims to overcome on their own, and so the Followers of the Falling Fire need the player characters to be their instrument of wrath.

### Interactions

The Ironhelm siblings have hired a company of dwarven veterans and miners to help carry out their operation. In total, the four Ironhelm siblings lead an expedition of roughly thirty individuals. The expedition consists of the four Ironhelm siblings, 8 dwarven [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), and 12 dwarven [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md). The Ironhelms and oversee the work, while the veterans protect the campsite while the thugs work mining the scar.

The dwarves work in half-day shifts to avoid the effects of contamination and the Haze. At any given time, two of the expedition leaders are present at the camp, along with half the dwarves. The others are resting in Emberwood Village, where they have rooms at the Red Lion Hotel. Characters could opt to engage with the Ironhelms at either the Spokes Smithy or in Emberwood Village. However, because the dwarves are split up, all four need to meet personally to discuss any deal they're presented with first. If the characters want to negotiate with the dwarves, they'll have to wait until a shift changes (when all the dwarves are in the city).

#### The Ironhelm Siblings

The Ironhelm Siblings have relocated from their ancestral home in the Glimmer Mountains to stake a new claim in Drakkenheim. Their old gold mine has run dry, and so delerium is their new commodity.

The siblings share the following roleplaying characteristics:

- **Ideal.** If you work hard and deal fairly, you're sure to make something of yourself in this world.  
- **Bond.** We have to carry on the family business.  
- **Flaw.** Words are worth horse spit. We don't trust what anyone says, and judge them only by their actions.  

#### Reginald Ironhelm

This dwarf [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) wears a trench coat inlaid with gold buttons and has a satchel full of mechanical bits. He wears a bandolier full of bullets, a monocle over his right eye, and has many tools and trinkets hanging from his belt. His bulbous nose and beady eyes accent his huge moustache and mutton chops but, unlike many dwarves, sports a clean shaven chin. His black hair is always slicked back to keep it off his brow and face.

- **Personality Trait.** Reginald is all about the numbers - he trusts facts, figures, and proven results. He is not the type to make a risky decision on a hunch. He prefers calculated and educated results.  

#### Mordecai Ironhelm

A dwarf [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) garbed in black cloak and trenchcoat, he has several daggers at the ready along his coat, and his belt contains several vials of poison. He has long black hair, a scar down the side of his face, and a black goatee that trails down to his belt buckle.

- **Personality Trait.** Mordecai is always looking for a better deal or a way to sweeten the pot. He has a charisma to him, even if he is a little rough around the edges. He is blunt with his remarks, but very good at reading people. He knows when to push, and when to put on the charm.  

![Gertrude Ironhelm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/071-05-017.gertrude.webp#center)

#### Gertrude Ironhelm

A dwarf [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) who wields two golden axes, she has dark brown hair laced into three separate braided ponytails. She has long sideburns that she lets grow down, and a very stern look on her face.

- **Personality Trait.** Gertrude has always trusted her instincts. She listens to her gut and it's gotten her this far. She doesn't mind playing rough and aggressive if it helps her and her family accomplish their goals. She is highly protective of her friends and family.  

#### Elouise Ironhelm

A dwarf [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) who keeps the ancestral dwarven faith. She is dressed in common grey robes, complemented by thick leather strappings and a breast plate. She has a mechanical trinket hanging around her neck and a belt full of various hammers and tools. She has long brown hair flowing down to her knees, big bright eyes, and a kind yet cunning look upon her face.

- **Personality Trait.** Elouise respects tradition, and wants to preserve her family's ancestral ways. She constantly reminds her siblings they need to stick together. She is the kindest of the siblings and will always try to find a means to peaceful resolution if possible.  

#### Negotiating with the Ironhelms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Promises are worth as much as pig shite. Your actions have currency with us, though. Show your mettle and we can entertain your offer. Protecting this place at night is the hardest part of the job. Prove you'll help us by doing a night shift. Then we'll talk about your little offer."
^355

The dwarves currently have three active deals:

- They pay fifteen percent of their current earnings to the Queen of Thieves as part of her protection racket.  
- They spend half of their earnings on supplies, equipment upkeep, wages, accommodations, and other business expenses.  
- They sell their delerium at a bulk rate to Fairweather Trades and Exports in Emberwood Village, and so only get about eighty percent of its market value.  

The Ironhelms find the offers made by the Amethyst Academy and the Hooded Lanterns intriguing. Nevertheless, the dwarves drive a hard bargain on principle, and explain that if they break their agreement with the Queen of Thieves, they're concerned she will act against them more aggressively. As such, the Ironhelms won't accept any agreement that doesn't include proven assurance of protection in the future. They need proof the faction can protect their mining operation from monsters, as well as anyone sent by the Queen of Thieves. They reason that since the faction dispatched the player characters to negotiate with them, then the characters should be the ones who provide this protection... assuming they are up to the task. They ask the characters to protect the Smithy during a night shift to demonstrate their capabilities.

#### Sabotaging the Ironhelms

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Take your demands and shove them up your arse. There's money to be made here and we're not leaving. If you wish to contest our claim, you're free to do so before the barrel of a gun."
^357

Convincing the Ironhelm siblings to simply abandon their operation is nearly impossible. They have invested too much time and energy into fortifying the location and building a functioning business by prospecting the Scar. They laugh in the faces of those who try to tell them to pack up and leave. Instead, characters will need to resort to other tactics to get the dwarves to give up peacefully.

Characters working for the Queen of Thieves, the Silver Order, or the Falling Fire might be looking for ways to disrupt, drive off, or sabotage the Ironhelms without necessarily slaying them. A few possibilities include one or more of the following:

- Luring additional monsters to attack the Spokes Smithy or occupy the Scar  
- Stealing or breaking their gunpowder weapons  
- Ruining the forge or the dwarves' supplies  
- Stealing or sabotaging the dwarves' mining equipment or wagons  
- Convincing the dwarven hirelings to desert the Ironhelms  
- Getting the dwarves kicked out of the Red Lion Hotel, or getting them blacklisted by the merchants in Emberwood Village  
- Destroying the defenses around the smithy or even the entire building itself  

Finally, slaying the dwarves is always an option, though a rather murderous one. It's possible that if one or more of the Ironhelm siblings dies, the others might be convinced to give up.

### Area Details

The Spokes Smithy is a roofed outdoor blacksmith shop with a small office. It's been heavily fortified and overlooks the Scar.

#### The Scar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Scar is three hundred feet long, twenty to thirty feet wide, and ten feet deep. The melted earth has turned to black glass and glittering obsidian sand, and the trench is now among the richest delerium veins outside the city centre.
^35a

- Most of the delerium found here are chips and fragments fused into the earth, and it requires diligent work to extract.  

#### [1-6] Spokes Smithy

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Spokes Smithy is a relatively small blacksmith shop. It has its covered forge, a small office, a yard that now functions as a campsite, and a series of barricades recently constructed by the Ironhelms to secure the location. They have setup three gun platforms around the perimeter, each a features a massive cannon of dwarven construction..
> 
> A thunderous staccato and a whirring mechanical sound echo across the ravine. As the noise dies down, it's replaced by a bellowing voice calling out "All clear!" in dwarven and the sound of clinking hammers and picks against stone. A field of monstrous corpses is splayed out all around: dead ratlings, mutated dregs, and other slain horrors. "Stand down." Calls the bellowing voice "Any beastie gets a bullet, but if you're no monster, you may pass."

##### [1] Forge

An impressive furnace and anvil rests in a covered workshop lined with hanging tools and equipment. The Ironhelms use the forge currently to manufacture bullets for their weapons and fix up their other armour and mining gear. Mordecai can often be found in the forge during night shifts making sure ammo is stocked and ready.

- *Treasure*: There is a set of [smith's tools](Mechanics/items/smiths-tools.md) and a large piece of meteoric iron here that could be worked into a weapon or piece of armour by a skilled smith.  

##### [2] Smithy's Office

This small office has a desk and a small iron safe. There is an old bookshelf along one wall lined with design plans, blueprints, and recipes for various forge-made gear. A book on the desk details the numbers regarding the prospecting and selling of delerium. Reginald can be found in the office during the day crunching numbers.

- *Treasure*: The safe in the room is locked (DC 20). It contains four gold bars each worth 1,000gp along with a box containing two delerium crystals.  

##### [3] Campsite

Between the smithy and the scar is a makeshift camp that houses a small bonfire, a few large chunks of debris repurposed into seating, a pair of tents for those needing a short rest or privacy, and an old cooking pot that hangs over the fire. During the day Elouise can often be found here cooking a travelers stew and aiding anyone who has suffered injuries.

- *Treasure*: Next to one of the tents is a small satchel containing [restorative ointment](Mechanics/items/keoghtoms-ointment.md) and a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md).  

##### [4] East Barricade

The larger of the two main barricades covers the open side of the building and exposed campsite and is composed of a small stone fence reinforced by wooden spikes and barbed wire. A makeshift iron gate sits in the middle and several burlap bags of sand and dirt are piled atop the wall where a row of muskets can be perched. Behind the wall are two boxes each containing eight sticks of dynamite that the dwarves occasionally use in the Scar, or to defend the camp. Gertrude can be found here most of the time during the night shift.

##### [5] West Barricade

The West Barricade is much the same as the east but covers less ground and doesn't have a gate. Its purpose is to block the open gap between the long end of the smithy and the Scar.

##### [6] Gun Platforms

Around the smithy are small platforms recently constructed, with a ladder that goes down to the camp below. The platform has a reinforced barricade wall built along the side facing out towards the city and a mounted turret has been bolted to the platform here. Upon each platform is a cannon. There is a stack of cannonballs and several barrels of gunpowder next to each.

### Working the Night Shift

During the night, the characters have four events. Roll `1d8` for each event to determine which hour of the night the attack occurs: if you get a duplicate result, bad luck for the players! In such a case, the two attacks happen `10d6` minutes apart.

The dwarves are reluctant to let characters use the gun themselves, but can be convinced by a character who makes a good argument or who displays sophisticated engineering knowledge (DC 18). If the character insists on more illumination, they experience an additional encounter during the evening. If the players take the night shift, the normal night shift takes a break and the characters are accompanied by one of the Ironhelm siblings as well as 4 dwarf [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) and 2 dwarf [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md).

The dwarves rely on their [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) at night. They remind characters that at night, light sources will attract more monsters. The only light source the dwarves allow at night is their bonfire.

The mists of the Haze recede at night, and a billowing corona of octarine light appears above the crater. This creates dim illumination in the area of the camp and the Scar, but creatures and objects further than 120 feet away are totally obscured unless the characters have features or traits that allow them to see further in darkness.

#### Events

##### Swarm of the Walking Dead

As night falls and the glow of the delerium clusters that pepper the Scar cast an octarine light across the lonely smithy, the sounds of shuffling and moans begin to fill the air - distant at first, but getting closer, and coming from all directions. 12 [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) emerge on the first round, and `1d6` more [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) appear each round afterwards for the next minute.

##### Haze Hulks

A series of loud wails erupt through the streets and the sounds of lumbering limbs cascade towards the smithy - something big is coming. Three [haze hulks](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) emerge fromthe haze and charge towards the smithy.

##### Chimera

A [chimera](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) swoops down to attack. "We're out of ammo!" rings out from the gun platform. None of the firearms nor the cannon are usable for any further encounters. It's at this moment that a terrible screech is heard from above. `1d4` rounds in, 10 [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) emerge from the haze as well.

##### Ratling Horde

Attracted by the sounds and chaos, a horde of 20 [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) emerge in hopes of scavenging off the dead corpses littering the field.

> [!note] Developments
> 
> **Accepting the Offer.** If the characters successfully defend the site during the night shift, the Ironhelms are happy to accept an offer made by the Amethyst Academy or the Hooded Lanterns. As a result, characters have won a new ally. However, Reginald and Elouise tell the characters that it's now their responsibility to help the dwarves out if they need defenders in the future. They'll contact the characters via a [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) spell if they ever need them.
> 
> At a pivotal moment in the campaign, the Queen of Thieves (or another rival faction) might time an attack against the dwarves with another crucial event. If you want to up the stakes during an otherwise straightforward mission, the Ironhelms call for aid when the players are already stretched for time. Alternatively, they might request aid immediately after an intense battle when the characters are low on resources.
> 
> The Amethyst Academy and the Hooded Lanterns reward characters with a faction boon for their excellent work. At your option, the Ironhelm dwarves might be willing to teach the characters how to use gunpowder weapons, and give them each a gun and ammunition. Later in the campaign, the dwarves could be called up to provide weapons for a major offensive as well.
> 
> **The Queen's New Deal.** If the characters sabotage the dwarven weapons but don't otherwise cause major disruptions to the dwarven mining operation, they begrudgingly acquiesce to the Queen of Thieves demands. She rewards characters with a faction boon, and lets characters keep any guns or ammunition they might have absconded with (or remarks on how foolish the characters were if they did not purloin the weapons for themselves).
> 
> However, in the event the sabotage went too far or any of the Ironhelm siblings were killed, the Queen of Thieves is greatly displeased and informs the characters that they are now expected to make up the difference in profits. She quotes an outrageous figure, saying the characters have cost her thousands of gold. She expects them to adequately make up the difference in a timely fashion, and uses this fact to blackmail them into doing her dirty work for as long as possible.
> 
> **Driving out the Dwarves.** If the dwarven mining operations are extensively sabotaged, the Ironhelm siblings are financially ruined. The cost of buying new equipment, hiring new labourers, and building new defenses is simply too much to bear. Combined with the threat of further retribution from another faction, this is sufficient to convince them to leave.
> 
> However, if it seems like the dwarves could recuperate or repair whatever damages the player characters caused, they might seek out aid from another faction to protect them from future attacks. The next time the characters arrive, a strike team from a rival faction is on site as additional muscle.
> 
> **Wiping out the Dwarves.** Should the characters decide to simply slay the dwarves, they're in for a bloody battle. If the tide of battle turns against them, Reginald and Elouise contact their siblings outside Drakkenheim via a [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) spell. Since the dwarves work in two shifts, the characters will have to deal with both groups. If one group is slain, the other does not exact immediate vengeance - instead, the survivors seek out help from the Hooded Lanterns, the Amethyst Academy, or the Queen of Thieves. Each faction is more than willing to send a strike team of their own to help the Ironhelm dwarves.
> 
> The next time a rival faction sends out a strike team against the party, add the remaining Ironhelm siblings and `1d4` dwarf [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) to the strike team.

## Stick's Ferry

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/075-05-019.sticks-ferry.webp#center)

The major bridges spanning the Drann River are all located within the Inner City. Before Drakkenheim was destroyed, crossing the river via these bridges required merchants and travellers to pay the gate tax to enter the city proper, or otherwise make a detour fifteen miles south or west to other river crossings. During this time, an old boatman named Pixis Stick made his living illicitly ferrying folk across the Drann River on the southern side of town using his rowboat. Often simply called the "Ferryman", he enjoyed meeting the urchins and ne'er-do-wells who inhabited Drakkenheim, and swapping stories and gossip with penny-pinching merchants.

When the meteor fell, the Ferryman became a [haze husk](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md), one of the tortured and mindless undead creatures that drift aimlessly about the city. However, he retained a strange semblance of his past memory, and is not hostile to passersby. Instead, the Ferryman takes paying passengers back and forth across the Drann River just as he did in life. He now only communicates in low moans and grunts, but the Ferryman still seems to enjoy company, conversation, and of course, gold.

### Rejuvenation

If the Ferryman is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in one hour unless a [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell is cast on its remains.

### Taking the Ferry

The Ferryman inexplicably rows up to the water's edge whenever characters arrive at either bank of the river on the southwest outskirts of Drakkenheim. If the characters approach him, the Ferryman grunts, gestures to his boat, and holds out his hand. He waits until each person who enters his rowboat gives him anything resembling a gold piece. Once every passenger has paid their fare, the Ferryman takes them across the water. He only transports characters to the opposite side of the river, and cannot be commanded to do anything else. He growls if someone else tries to take the oars from him, and only fights to defend himself or protect his boat.

### Ferryman's Treasure

When alone, the Ferryman mindlessly returns to his old stash to hide his gold. He keeps a duck-shaped buoy in the middle of the river, which connects to several ropes attached to sacks of gold hidden below the water. All told, the Ferryman's treasure consists of 2,374 gold pieces placed in about a dozen satchels.
