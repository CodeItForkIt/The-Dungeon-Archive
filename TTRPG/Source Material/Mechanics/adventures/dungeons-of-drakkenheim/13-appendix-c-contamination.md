# Appendix C: Contamination
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 222* 

Characters exploring Drakkenheim may be exposed to eldritch pollutants within the Haze or arcane radiation emitted by delerium. These hazards cause a new condition called contamination, which inflicts both debilitating symptoms and otherworldly mutations.

Contamination is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of contamination, as specified in the effect's description. If an already contaminated creature suffers another effect that causes further contamination, its current level of contamination increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

In addition, each time a character finishes a long rest while they have one or more contamination levels, roll ``. On a 1, they gain a contamination level.

Upon reaching contamination level 6 or higher, the creature transforms as described in the "Monstrous Transformation" section.

## Contamination Symptoms

A contaminated creature suffers the symptoms from its current level as well as all lower levels.

| Level | Symptoms |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | None. |
| 2 | Hit points regained by expending hit dice halved. |
| 3 | No hit points regained at the end of a long rest. |
| 4 | Damage dealt by weapon attacks and spells halved. |
| 5 | [Incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). |
| 6 | Monstrous Transformation! |

## Mutations

In addition to suffering symptoms, each time a character gains a contamination level, it rolls `1d6`. If the result is equal to or less than the character's current contamination level the creature gains a mutation. The Game Master may choose the mutation, or determine it randomly by rolling `` on the Mutations Table. If the result is the same as a mutation affecting the creature currently, the GM chooses a different one or rolls again.

**Mutations**

`dice: [](13-appendix-c-contamination.md#^mutations)`

| dice: 1d20 | Mutations |
|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Rampant Mutation! Roll twice, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. |
| 2 | Rasping. Your vocal cords warp, and you may only speak in a halting gurgle. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, your tongue rots and falls out, and you can no longer speak. |
| 3 | Wasting. Your fingernails, teeth, and toenails start falling out. `2d6` fall out for each contamination level you have gained. |
| 4 | Rotting. Your lips, nose, and ears blacken and wither. If you reach 4 or more contamination levels, they rot and fall off. You can still speak and hear, however. |
| 5 | Molting. Painful blisters, welts, and multicoloured lesions appear all over your skin, which burst and peel off painfully, exposing the raw sinew underneath. Once you reach 4 contamination levels, your skin entirely sloughs off. |
| 6 | Shedding. Each time you gain a contamination level, some of your hair falls out in patches. Once you reach 4 or more contamination levels, all hair on your body completely falls out. |
| 7 | Lambent Glow. You emit a dim octarine glow to a range of 10 feet. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, you instead emit bright light to a range of 30 feet. |
| 8 | Ocular Tumors. An eyeball opens somewhere on your body for each contamination level you have gained. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, you can see in all directions. |
| 9 | Spiked Growths. At the start of each of your turns, you deal 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage to any creature you are grappling. |
| 10 | Aquatic Adaptation. You sprout fish-like fins and gills. You gain a swimming speed equal to your land speed and can breathe underwater. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, you can only breathe underwater; but can hold your breath outside water for up to 1 hour. |
| 11 | Amorphous Form. Your bones and organs become gelatinous. You can move through a space as narrow as 6 inches wide without squeezing. |
| 12 | Chitinous Skin. Shell-like growths appear all over your body, giving you a +1 bonus to AC. If you have four or more contamination levels, this bonus increases to +2. |
| 13 | Cyclopean Vision. Your eyes merge into a single central eye which can emit an energy beam as a ranged spell attack using your Intelligence modifier for the attack roll. If it hits, it deals `2d6` radiant damage. |
| 14 | Spatial Displacement. You can cast [misty step](Mechanics/spells/misty-step.md) once for each contamination level you have gained. You regain these uses when you finish a long rest. |
| 15 | Tentacled Limb. One of your arms becomes a fleshy tentacle. When you make a melee attack on your turn, increase your reach by 5 feet. |
| 16 | Spider Climb. You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed. You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. |
| 17 | Whispering Voices. You gain telepathy to a range of 10 feet, but other people hear it as their own voice. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, the range extends to 60 feet. |
| 18 | Belly Maw. A toothy mouth appears on your stomach, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to `1d6` + your Strength modifier. |
| 19 | Eyeless Sight. Your eyes become milky orbs, and you gain [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) to a range of 10 feet. If you have 4 or more contamination levels, your eyes rot out, and dim octarine light burns in the sockets. Your [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) increases to 30 feet, but you are blind beyond this radius. |
| 20 | Arcane Blood. Gain an additional spell slot of the highest level you can cast (to a maximum of 5th level). If you don't have spell slots, your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to your level. Double with 4 or more contamination levels. |

## Removing Contamination

Only specific magic can remove contamination levels. Creatures do not recover naturally. The [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) spell can remove contamination, but it leaves affected characters exhausted. A [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md) spell removes all contamination levels and mutations from a contaminated character.

An effect which removes a contamination level also removes one randomly determined mutation. All contamination symptoms end and all mutations are removed if a creature's contamination level is reduced below 1. Skin, hair, fingernails, and toenails lost to mutations regrow normally once contamination is removed. However, a [regenerate](Mechanics/spells/regenerate.md) spell or similar magic is needed to restore any other body parts (such as teeth, limbs, or eyes) lost as a result of contamination levels. Appendages or limbs which develop as a result of mutations wither and fall off when contamination is removed, and other warped body parts are restored to their original form.

## Death and Dying while Contaminated

When a humanoid creature with any contamination levels dies, it animates as a [haze husk](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) 24 hours later. A creature with six or more class levels or hit dice rises as a [haze wight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) instead.

Being raised from the dead reduces a creature's contamination level by one.

## Monstrous Transformation!

A creature who reaches contamination level 6 or higher triggers a transformation into a horrific monster controlled by the Game Master. Once triggered, the transformation finishes in 1 round. It is thereafter permanent. Game Masters are encouraged to narrate a suitably gory description of the transformation.

The Game Master chooses the creature's new form, which is most often an aberration or monstrosity of some kind such as a [delerium dreg](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md), [haze hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md), or [gibbering mouther](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) (see Appendix A). The new form usually has a challenge rating similar to that of the original creature, but under appropriate circumstances you can choose one that is much higher or much lower.

The creature's game statistics are entirely replaced by those of the chosen monster. The creature assumes the new form's hit points and hit dice. All contamination levels are removed, though the GM may grant additional traits to the new form similar to any beneficial mutations gained from contamination levels.

The GM determines what remains of the original creature's personality and memories, if anything. Regardless, the creature is invariably driven mad by the transformation and falls under the GM's control.

### Reversing the Transformation

The means of reversing a monstrous transformation are completely unknown at the outset of the campaign. A monstrous transformation is widely regarded as permanent, though many still search the ruins for answers. Those who do may eventually be able to research the [siphon contamination](Mechanics/spells/siphon-contamination-dodk.md) spell.

A [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell or similar magic can restore a single transformed creature to its previous form, removing all madness and contamination in the process. This is considered a stressful use of the *wish* spell, and thus there is a 33 percent chance that the caster will be unable to cast *wish* ever again if they use the spell in this manner.

The transformation is otherwise irreversible by any means short of divine intervention. Nevertheless, at the Game Master's discretion, it may be possible to temporarily alleviate a transformed creature's innate madness. However, an intelligent monster who receives long-term treatment of any sort may eventually conspire to contaminate or subtly corrupt its caretakers.
