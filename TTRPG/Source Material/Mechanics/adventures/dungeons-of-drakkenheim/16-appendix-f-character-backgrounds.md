Many types of Adventurers travel to the ruins of Drakkenheim in hopes of uncovering things once lost. Whatever their call to the city may be, there is a chance that their history is ripe with danger. Some have colourful pasts that have readied them for the dangers ahead, some have crimes and mistakes they seek to hide from in the ruins, and others are bound to those who fight for what's left of the crumbling empire.
