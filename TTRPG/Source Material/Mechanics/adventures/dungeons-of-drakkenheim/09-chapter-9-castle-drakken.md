# Chapter 9: Castle Drakken
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 178* 

Looming over Drakkenheim stands the mighty Castle Drakken. Once a royal palace, military fortress, and administrative hub, the stronghold is now a grim monument to madness and horror. Any who wish to discover what ultimately happened to King Ulrich IV or unearth conclusive evidence to prove a royal claim will find what they are seeking here. Those who come bearing the *Seals of Drakkenheim* may even be able seat a new ruler upon the *Throne of Drakkenheim*, if they can defeat the deadly creatures conjured by the Haze and the former castle guardians left unhinged by its influence.

An unspeakable abomination known as the [Amalgamation](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/amalgamation-dodk.md) has taken root in the throne room. However, its physical form is a mere corporeal manifestation of a multidimensional entity that extends into multiple places and planes at once. Feeding on the powerful magic within the foundations of Castle Drakken, the Amalgamation anchors the first major dimensional rift opened by the Haze, which slowly draws extraplanar terrors into the mortal world. Eventually the rift will expand, tearing apart the castle and leaving behind a sickening hole in reality.

## Overview

Characters should be at least 11th level before taking on Castle Drakken, and may reach 13th level or higher before defeating all the challenges within. Read this chapter carefully: Castle Drakken is a sprawling and dynamic environment with many interconnected interactions. There is no set order in which characters must progress through the castle! High level characters have many abilities including flight and teleportation, and the following scenarios are designed with these capabilities in mind. Characters lacking these powers may find Castle Drakken significantly more difficult.

### Adventure Hooks

#### Seize the Throne

The political future of Westemär rests upon successfully reclaiming Castle Drakken. Though their motives differ, both the Hooded Lanterns and the Queen of Thieves wish to gain entry to the throne room, obtain the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md), and install a new monarch using the Seals of Drakkenheim. Meanwhile, the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, and the Silver Order all understand that supporting a new monarch means they can gain immense influence over what is done about the delerium in Drakkenheim. If you have more than one potential candidate for the throne, you might have a serious political drama on your hands.

#### Investigate the Dimensional Rift

The dimensional rift signals the dangerous progression of the Haze, but characters might first discover a similar rift within the Inscrutable Tower. In this case, Eldrick Runeweaver may theorize that other such rifts could form within the Haze, especially around areas where structures were infused with powerful magic already. Castle Drakken is such a place, so the possibility of a similar effect happening there simply cannot be ignored.

#### Treasures of Castle Drakken

The Followers of the Falling Fire and the Silver Order need two great treasures found inside Castle Drakken to achieve their final goals. First is the Diamond of Mount Kadath, the crowning jewel of the royal treasure vault. The other is a Relic of Saint Vitruvio: the [Shield of the Sacred Flame](Mechanics/items/the-shield-of-sacred-flame-dodk.md). Though believed to be in the castle chapel or the royal treasure vaults, the relic is now actually in the royal apartments.

## Interactions

Whether ally or enemy, the factions play their best cards now. In addition, players might find unexpected aid among the horrific creatures who inhabit the castle.

### Allied Support

Even the mightiest player characters will need assistance from one or more factions to overcome the monsters and challenges present in Castle Drakken. Factions only place their full resources behind an expedition to Castle Drakken to allied characters who have achieved the following:

- Demonstrated their trustworthiness and full loyalty to the faction's ideals and goals.  
- Acquired the *Seals of Drakkenheim* and located a potential heir to the throne.  
- Secured the cathedral and/or the Inscrutable Tower.  
- Defeated at least one other rival faction and/or created an alliance with two other factions.  
- Acquired reliable means to protect themselves against contamination.  

Launching a full-scale siege on Castle Drakken is far beyond the capabilities of any faction. Instead, they propose an elite strike team led by the player characters. Before committing their forces, the faction leaders request the characters thoroughly scout the castle grounds and determine what lurks within the palace, especially the throne room and the royal apartments. Each wants to develop a clear strategy, and notes that securing Castle Drakken in a single expedition is unlikely.

Once characters return from Castle Drakken with a well-developed report that confirms what lies in the throne room, the factions should offer their greatest boons and finest agents to help players put together a team to take the palace. This force could reasonably include a faction leader, one or more faction lieutenants, a group of rival adventurers, and a faction strike team. Many faction leaders can also offer key insight and knowledge about the castle:

- The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) and [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) intimately know the layout of Castle Drakken, including the location of any secret passages. They can answer questions about the former inhabitants of the castle and provide specific details about how the *Seals of Drakkenheim* are used to crown a new monarch.  
- [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) can provide characters with excellent information about the magical defenses of Castle Drakken. He can study the nature of the dimensional rift and accurately assess what is required to close it down, given a full report.  
- [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) performs powerful divinations to discern the future. Characters may ask her anything about the castle, but she replies in truthful yet cryptic clues in the form of prophetic statements.  
- [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) can't offer much information about Castle Drakken, but he commands the finest air force amongst the factions. He can offer characters advice on how to take the castle by the air, noting that there's no reason for the characters to walk in the front gate if they can fly up to the balconies!  

### Enemy Interlopers

Allied faction leaders should warn the player characters that counterstrikes and interference from the other factions are almost certain. When enemy factions discover the player characters are exploring Castle Drakken, they see it as an opportunity to defeat them once and for all. They begin enacting their more dangerous and underhanded schemes, and enemy faction leaders will personally lead an elite strike team into Castle Drakken to confront the player characters.

### Neutral Parties

The time to remain on the sidelines has passed. If by some chance the characters kept relatively neutral interactions with one or more of the factions, the leaders of those factions should contact the player characters to arrange a meeting once they learn they are successfully exploring Castle Drakken. The faction leader offers their support, but demands their goals be factored into any plans the player characters might have for the future of Drakkenheim. The outcome of this final interaction will determine if that faction emerges as an ally or enemy.

### Missing Seals

By this point in the adventure the player characters should have located the *Seals of Drakkenheim* and learned of their significance. However, if the characters missed any of the seals still lost in the ruins, a group of rival adventurers might find them instead. If enemy faction leaders still possess one or more of the seals, you can have these NPCs reveal this fact during a tense negotiation as a bargaining chip. The players might make a deal, or plot to take the seal by force or stealth. Either way, you should ensure all six seals are "in play" before the player characters head to Castle Drakken.

### The Royal Steward

Johann Eisner was the royal steward of Drakkenheim. As the Haze engulfed the castle, he attempted to rescue Ulrich IV, but failed. He fled to the crypts where he became trapped. Now, his body and mind are fused to the Foundation Pillar in the Monarchal Crypt. As a result, he can now tap into the magic within the castle. He dutifully acts as custodian of this damned place to contain the horrors within. However, the steward has endured this torturous experience for fifteen years. It is only a matter of time before he falters and fully succumbs to madness.

Initially, the steward attempts to bar characters' entry to the royal palace and drive them out of the castle. Nevertheless, if characters make an earnest attempt to communicate with him, the steward responds cautiously. Once he believes the characters are capable and well-intentioned, the steward implores them to rescue him from the crypts. Then, he shares his knowledge and plans (see "Eternal Custodian" in the Developments section for details.)

- **Personality.** I pay exceptional attention to the finest details in my work.  
- **Ideal.** A loyal steward discreetly manages the affairs of state and household unseen.  
- **Bond.** I pledged my life to serve my liege, my homeland, and my family.  
- **Flaw.** Others often fail to live up to my exacting standards. I personally perform many tasks I don't trust anyone else to handle properly.  

The steward's mind inhabits Castle Drakken itself. He has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 16, and a +11 bonus on [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) checks. He speaks, reads, and understands common plus four other languages, and can see and hear anything within sixty feet of the Foundation Pillar. He has the following additional traits:

#### Custodian's Eye

The steward creates an invisible, immobile magical sensor anywhere within Castle Drakken that hovers in the air for one minute. He can see and hear through the sensor as if he was there, and may cast spells as though he were in the sensor's space. The sensor dissipates if it takes any damage.

#### Innate Spellcasting

The steward's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). When he casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll `1d6`. On a 1, it triggers an arcane anomaly. He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

- At will: [mage hand](Mechanics/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible), [thaumaturgy](Mechanics/spells/thaumaturgy.md), [unseen servant](Mechanics/spells/unseen-servant.md).  
- 3/day: [animate objects](Mechanics/spells/animate-objects.md), [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md), [fear](Mechanics/spells/fear.md), [telekinesis](Mechanics/spells/telekinesis.md), [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md)  
- 1/day: [forcecage](Mechanics/spells/forcecage.md), [reverse gravity](Mechanics/spells/reverse-gravity.md), [symbol](Mechanics/spells/symbol.md)  

When using his magic, the steward may only leave cryptic messages of one or two words.

## Sealed Fate

At the DM's discretion, characters who possess a signet ring or token of some kind once owned by a member of the royal family (such as the [ring of protection](Mechanics/items/ring-of-protection.md) worn by Lenore) can also bypass castle defenses as if the item were a *Seal of Drakkenheim*.

## Castle Grounds

Castle Drakken is a sprawling palatial fortress built upon a two-hundred-foot-tall stepped plateau surrounded by rocky cliffs. The castle grounds are separated into two baileys by an internal dividing wall: the Lower Bailey contains administrative buildings, a military barracks, and servants quarters. The Upper Bailey grounds are elevated thirty feet above the Lower Bailey, feature the castle gardens, a chapel, and access to the royal palace of Castle Drakken. The palace itself perches atop the highest rocky pinnacle approximately two hundred fifty feet above the city proper, its imposing silhouette visible everywhere in the city below.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/131-map-8.01-castle-drakken-player.webp#gallery)

### Arcane Wards

Generations ago, House von Drakken commissioned the Amethyst Academy to weave a powerful magical ward upon the castle grounds and palace that remains in place today:

- Doors, walls and windows are magically reinforced, and are immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage, as well as non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from attacks. They are resistant to all other damage. The doors, walls and windows extend into the ethereal plane, blocking ethereal travel through them.  
- A radiant purple glow emanates from every window blocking line of sight from outside.  
- Creatures outside castle buildings can't teleport into any interior areas, nor can they teleport within the castle rooms unless they have a direct line of sight to their destination. A character attuned to a *Seal of Drakkenheim* ignores this effect.  

### Tower Dragons

The bronze dragons upon the towers that peer down with serpentine necks are no mere decorations. Castle Drakken is defended in a similar manner as the city walls themselves (see chapter 7), but the guardians are much more aggressive and hostile. 2 (`1d4`) [tower dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) and 10 (`3d6`) [wall gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) animate and attack characters who dare attempt any of the following:

- Travel up the roadway past the Cliff Gate on foot.  
- Climb more than halfway up the cliffs, walls, or towers.  
- Fly within three hundred feet of the outer walls horizontally, or over them at any height.  
- Enter the bailey courtyards with teleportation magic.  

The guardians relentlessly pursue their quarry within the castle grounds, but do not chase characters more than three hundred feet away from the castle grounds. They do not attack characters attuned to a *Seal of Drakkenheim*.

### Outer Walls

Stone masonry walls forty feet high and ten feet thick ring the clifftop, anchored by several bastion towers each sixty feet tall. Like the walls that surround the city, they are richly decorated with architectural details and menacing gargoyles.

### [1] Gates

A gently sloped cobblestone road twenty feet wide and lined with stepped battlements winds up the two-hundred-foot-tall cliff face from the Inner City towards Castle Drakken. Three gates are set along its path: The road begins from the Lower Gate, passes through the Cliff Gate halfway up the hill, then finally terminates at the Upper Gate that stands atop the cliff.

Each gate features a pair of bastion towers, double portcullis, and a drawbridge. Unfurled and torn banners bearing the coat-of-arms of House von Kessel hang from each tower. Though more ornamented than the city gates, their internal layout is quite similar.

#### [1a] Lower Gate

The lower gate of Castle Drakken rests at the base of the castle cliff. A broad city street meets the gate, and the surrounding neighbourhood is made up of noble estates and wealthy homes now occupied by ghosts and mutated dregs.

- The last regiment of the royal guard held the gate when the meteor fell. The petrified forms of the royal guard and a panicked throng of common folk are arranged here in a horrific tableaux. Their features are melted and warped, and several animate into 10 (`3d6`) [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) with flesh like wet concrete when approached.  
- Several guards who held fast against the gates have merged into it as a huddled mass. Their limbs are elongated and their faces stretched in odd otherworldly shapes that spring to life as 2 (`1d4`) [ropers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md). The gate will not open unless they are destroyed.  

#### [1b] Cliff Gate

Two [stone golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) defend this gate.

#### [1c] Upper Gate

These gates are built into the main castle walls and are sealed shut, opening only for one who bears a Seal of Drakkenheim.

### Random Encounters

Monsters wander the castle grounds. Check for random encounters each hour characters spend exploring Castle Drakken as described in chapter 5 using the table below. In addition, check for random encounters when characters enter certain buildings or rooms, as indicated by the area description:

`dice: [](09-chapter-9-castle-drakken.md#^1-random-encounter)`

| dice: 1d8 | Random Encounter |

^1-random-encounter

### Deep Haze

The entire castle is blanketed by a thick and insidious manifestation of the Deep Haze. Blinking motes of purple and red light bounce through the air, and flakes of delerium flutter like ash within.

### Delerium Deposits

Massive clusters of delerium shards have burst through the earth throughout the castle grounds. Crystals creep up the outer walls like a cancerous moss, surrounded by thick gobs of congealed Haze and bubbling delerium sludge. Corpses writhe and wriggle within, mouths and eyes forming at random.

- Though the massive clusters are too large for field extraction, characters can pry loose `1d4` crystals or `2d6` delerium shards from each.  
- This delerium was not left by the meteor; it has since grown in the Haze.  

### Endless Horror

Monsters inhabiting Castle Drakken are rejuvenated each night at midnight by the Haze, with replacements conjured for any banished or wholly destroyed creatures. This effect ends if the [Amalgamation](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/amalgamation-dodk.md) in the palace throne room is destroyed. However, if the dimensional rift is not then sealed (see the throne room) the Amalgamation itself rejuvenates `1d10` days later, and the monsters return shortly thereafter.

### [2] Lower Bailey Areas

The dusty and gravel-filled lower bailey has a fine bricked road leading through it from the front gate to the bailey gate. The ground is ashen and cracked, delerium clusters jutting from the earth. Check for a random encounter each time the characters enter one of the buildings below:

#### [2a] Armoury

This fortified warehouse houses cannons, siege engines, and esoteric weaponry, as well as a massive stockpile of conventional armour and armaments.

#### [2b] Barracks

In the middle of the bailey is a fortified building with several crenellated parapets and a high steepled roof. Outside are unfurled banners displaying the sigil of the royal guard. The ground floors contain officers quarters, a mess hall, and kitchen, while the upper floors are comfortable if spartan accommodations for the royal guards. The topmost level has private chambers for the guard captain.

#### [2c] Carriage House

This large garage houses a dozen royal carriages, wagons, and vehicles.

#### [2d] Servant's Lodge

This bending building housed accomodations for the common castle staff. It also features a large kitchen, bakery, well, and laundry facilities. The adjoining tower serves as a granary and dedicated storehouse for castle provisions including grain and preserved foods.

#### [2e] Stables

This massive L-shaped stable once sheltered dozens of horses. It is now a charnel house of bones and decaying leather; the noble steeds within were consumed by the castle's monstrous residents long ago. The loft above the stables contained a residence for the master of horses and the royal stablehands. The adjoining tower is the castle aerie, which was roost for the royal giant owls. In addition to a possible random encounter, six [manticores](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) live here now.

#### [2f] Workshops

A large outdoor forge, with several anvils and workstations. An adjoining shed contains raw materials: wood, iron ingots, finished nails, and all manner of tools.

#### [2g] Bailey Gate

The gate passage covers a curved ramp leading to the Upper Bailey.

### Prince of Carnage

A wingless [balor](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/balor.md) known as the Prince of Carnage has made the courtyard his territory, its body covered in lacerations and exposed raw muscle. Conjured by the Haze and bound to the castle grounds, the Prince of Carnage is an insane demon who believes himself to be a royal prince. He furiously attacks any who trespass the lower bailey, barring the way to the upper bailey in delusional claim over the ruined realm.

### Servant's Passage

A prominent set of doors in the basement of the **servant's lodge** opens into a narrow stone passage that leads under the Bailey Gate and connects to the palace proper. The passage isn't concealed: it was used daily by the castle staff to get to work in the palace, especially in the winter. However, the doors of the passage were sealed with an [arcane lock](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md). They open for anyone bearing a *Seal of Drakkenheim* or who speaks the password "Giggleshorts".

Characters interacting with the [warp witches](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warp-witch-dodk.md) and [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) found in the castle grounds may be able to learn the password from them.

### [3] Upper Bailey Areas

The regal Upper Bailey is a stark contrast to the Lower Bailey. Fields of dead grass, large contaminated pools, dried-out fountains, baroque statuary covered in ash, and twisted trees line a fine brick roadway leading to the palace entrance.

#### [3a] Overlook Tower

The north tower connects to a small exterior doorway large enough for humans to pass through. It allows access via a leisurely (if exhausting) walk down the cliff via a graceful stone staircase that leads to the ravine below. Pillared bannisters, exquisite statues, luscious fountains, and stone benches decorate the many porches, overlooking platforms, and balconies along the way.

#### [3b] Knight's Tower

This tower manor has small, if comfortable, accommodations for the knights in service to the monarch. Many levels contain several individual rooms, whereas others are whole apartments for particularly favoured champions.

#### [3c] Castle Gardens

A field large enough to set up a great outdoor tent for garden parties, the gardens contain fountains, statues, hedgerows, and decrepit flowerbeds.

### Castle Chapel

This small chapel of the Sacred Fire is dedicated to an obscure and ancient saint and lavishly decorated for its size with angelic sculptures. However, the crypts beneath are unfinished, the additions intended as a reliquary for the [Shield of the Sacred Flame](Mechanics/items/the-shield-of-sacred-flame-dodk.md) left incomplete.

- Roll or choose a random encounter the first time characters enter the chapel.  
- An altarbox left beside the brazier contains `1d4` [potions of superior healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-superior-healing.md), plus scrolls of [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md), [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md), and [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md). Inside is a letter from the steward:  

> [!quote] A quote from Johann Eisner, Royal Steward Royal Palace Areas  
> 
> Flamekeeper Maresa—My apologies for the construction delays. Lest you doubt the piety of our liege, rest assured his majesty has resolved to keep the shield of Saint Vitruvio over his mantleplace so he may closely meditate upon the Flame nightly until the new reliquary is complete.

Though outwardly imposing, the interior rooms of Castle Drakken contain luxurious chambers featuring grandeur beyond reckoning. These sumptuous rooms have been darkly twisted by eldritch forces; once lively halls shifted into destatured tones and sickly hues. Characters can enter the palace through the main door, the servant's passages, or by flying onto the balconies.

## Approach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The royal palace of Castle Drakken perches atop the highest pinnacle overlooking the city below. The heart of the citadel is a massive central keep connected to four great round towers via soaring bridges, which rise above two large stone chateaus each bedecked with parapets. The imperial building is topped with slate rooftops of midnight blue and elongated spires sharp like spear points. The outer walls feature immaculate stone moldings, overhanging balconies, flying buttresses, and tall arched windows with intricate stained glass designs. Upon the battlements are leering gargoyles and roosting dragons cast in bronze.
> 
> The main entrance is a fortified gate flanked by squat square towers. Engraved into each of the heavy iron double doors is a dragon rampant set with gold filigree. Above is a circular rose window fixed with delicate tracery. Beams of sickly purple light radiate from within. Gusts of sweeping wind kick up the smell of grave-dirt and ancient stone, and thunder crackles through the air.

### Minazorond

An [ancient bronze dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/ancient-bronze-dragon.md) named [Minazorond](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/minazorond-dodk.md) is eternally bound to serve as the guardian of Castle Drakken. He roosts atop the Stair Tower of the royal palace with his mind awash in nightmares. The dragon now believes the monstrous creatures dwelling in the castle to be its proper inhabitants, and perceives humanoid creatures as trespassers to be destroyed. Minazorond awakes with a thunderous roar that can be heard for miles away, and attacks if intruders approach within one hundred fifty feet of the royal palace by any means. The dragon does not speak, nor respond to reason or parley. He does not pursue his quarry beyond the castle grounds. However, Minazorond is too large to enter buildings or the palace, and cannot pursue creatures who flee inside.

[Minazorond](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/minazorond-dodk.md) possesses the additional traits of a [tower dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md), and may be rebuked by a creature bearing a *Seal of Drakkenheim* in a similar manner. Only a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell can cure his madness: he interacts as a dutiful, stoic, and wise protector thereafter.

## Main Entrance

### Front Gates

The grand double doors are closed and barred, and the portcullis lowered. A creature within thirty feet can use an action to present a Seal of Drakkenheim, which magically opens the doors.

### Vestibule

The entrance hallway of the royal palace is adorned with grand tapestries proudly displaying the House von Kessel arms. Tight rows of arched columns form aisles on either side of this room. Clerestory windows allow light to illuminate the room.

### Guardrooms

These unadorned stone chambers have narrow arrowslit windows. Weapon racks with bows, crossbows, and arrows, and spartan bunks furnish each. A ladder allows access between three levels with wooden floors and a winch room to operate the portcullis.

- The first time characters enter the palace, a force of 12 [haze wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) stands guard at the entrance. Thereafter, check for random encounters each time characters pass through the main entrance.  

### Palace Interior Features

The following details are common to all rooms in the royal palace except the basement, kitchen, and hidden passages.

#### Chambers and Corridors

Castle Drakken is lavishly and ostentatiously decorated. The castle rooms are each individually themed around a different pantheon of mythological heroes, gods, and monsters depicted in scenes from their greatest stories. You are encouraged to choose your favourite characters (even those from real-world myth) and place their likenesses throughout the castle art.

#### Amenities

Running water fountains, grand fireplace hearths, and coal stoves once provided comfort throughout the castle. The pipes and chimneys are now choked with contaminated water and Haze-infused soot.

#### Artwork

Massive painted murals and framed canvases adorn the walls and ceilings, and lifelike statues of carved marble rest on pedestals in many rooms. However, the once expressive and idealistic fairy-tale scenes now have disturbing undertones, bizarre contrasting colours, distorted features, warped perspectives, and oblique angles.

#### Ceilings

Most rooms and corridors have vaulted ceilings thirty feet high. All are decorated with frescoes and carved mouldings. Some truly elegant rooms feature a dome painted with a stunning circular panorama.

#### Doors

These paired doorways of reinforced wood have embossed panels and ornamentations.

#### Floors

Tiles of marble, porcelain, or stone are laid out in intricate arrangements. Many rooms also have large woven carpets bearing geometric patterns and golden tassels and trim.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/133-08-003.royal-ring.webp#center)

#### Furnishings

These elaborate antiques are upholstered with fine velvet and painted with gold.

#### Lighting

Brass and gold chandeliers strung with crystals and kept alight by [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) illuminate each chamber.

The Haze has transformed the once soft and golden firelight into unsettling hues of crimson, purple, and green.

#### Secret Doors

Castle Drakken contains many secret doors. These may be found with a DC 20 [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) check. Each wall section rotates on a central axis; pushing them open takes an action and a DC 10 Strength check. They automatically close afterwards.

#### Walls

Sculpted borders and baseboards in marble, ivory, or painted wood frame the walls. Many feature mascarons and leering faces with draconic designs. The rare areas without windows or paintings often feature intricate patterned tapestries or wallpaper.

#### Windows

Paned glass windows are decorated with tracery and stained glass, and hung with curtains of silk and sable.

### Looting the Castle

The artwork and furnishings in each room of Castle Drakken are extraordinarily valuable. Any given chamber contains `1d6` objects worth 250 gp each and `1d4` objects worth 750 gp each. However, transporting and fencing these items may be a challenge.

### Chateau Halls

Ceilings in the castle chateau reach a height of forty feet, though the attic above extends the roof twenty feet higher beyond.

#### Central Passage

Artwork and statues in this columned hall depict the past monarchs of Drakkenheim. Most belong to the original ruling family, House von Drakken, with only the most recent ones belonging to House von Kessel. Stairs on either end connected to the chateau basement, beside sets of double doors lead to the palace entrance and the antechamber.

#### Banquet Hall

This room features two lines of feasting tables set with tablecloths and golden candlesticks. Porcelain plates, silver utensils, and napkins provide table settings to accommodate a hundred people.

#### Dining Room

This dining room is richly decorated with far more lavish settings than the banquet hall, as it seats only twenty four important guests.

#### Drawing Room

This well-appointed salon contains several comfortable wingback chairs, settees, and side tables. A delicate cabinet is stocked with exquisite spirits and fine tobacco.

#### Grand Ballroom

This splendid long hall has grand mirrors opposite the windows, filling the walls at each end and incorporated into the ceiling, creating the illusion of a vast and almost endless interior space. Gold-painted pillars, glass and silver chandeliers, and flowing curtains inlaid with fine embroidery complete the room. Upholstered benches and dancing statues rest in alcoves on each side of the room. A small platform at one end has a collection of chairs, music stands, and antique stringed instruments.

- Hundreds of intangible spirits of long-dead nobles manifest in these chambers, playing out the last masquerade ball held in Castle Drakken. Meanwhile, three dozen [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) carry out their duties as serving staff, bringing spoiled wine and foetid hor'dourves to the "guests". Characters passing through the chamber are treated like familiar and celebrated guests, and invited to share their heroic tales and partake in the dance. Characters can pass through the chateau unopposed so long as they humor the spirits; but should they shatter the delusions, the spirits angrily vanish save for 10 (`3d6`) hostile [warp witches](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warp-witch-dodk.md).  
- Check for a random encounter each time characters pass through the chateau thereafter.  

### Chateau Basement

#### Kitchen

This gigantic kitchen could prepare a banquet for hundreds, and contains several ovens, stoves, and large preparation tables. It reeks of offal, but is disturbingly tidy otherwise. Cabinets and shelves with spices, cooking utensils, plates, and spoiled stores line the walls.

- The three renowned castle chefs - Frier, Olivier, and Ramsay - still remain in the kitchen. They have transformed into hideous creatures imbued with magic power (use the game statistic of a [night hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) but their creature type is aberration). The three chefs despise each other yet feed off their rivalry, and assume anyone entering the kitchen who isn't openly wearing a *Seal of Drakkenheim* is an underling they can boss around. The chefs furiously reprimand intruders for being "late", order them to get to work, then berate and insult the quality of any tasks performed. They attack if they aren't obeyed.  
- Each time characters enter the kitchen, check for a random encounter. Any creatures that might be encountered are working (poorly) in the kitchen and being abused by the chefs.  

#### Larders

These three chambers contained the food supplies for the palace upon and within shelves and containers, almost all of which were eaten or contaminated. One stored dry goods at normal room temperature, but the other two are magically enchanted with temperatures of 40 and -180 fahrenheit.

#### Basement Storeroom

These dusty storerooms contain extra furnishings, textiles, and utensils used during parties and galas held in the palace, neatly stacked and cleanly organized. Behind an upturned table is a secret door to a short passage connected to the Dungeon Vaults.

#### Wine Cellar

Racks containing hundreds of bottles of fine wine and spirits organized in a byzantine fashion line this cellar. One wine rack conceals a secret door opening to a long passage that leads to the Bureaucratic Archives in the Steward's Tower.

#### Scullery

This room smells of soap, and has large basins for washing laundry connected to taps of running water.

#### Privvies

This washchamber contains rows of privvies used by castle guests.

#### Side Entrance

These broad steps include a gently sloping ramp that leads outside the palace.

#### Servants Staircase

This spiral staircase has an integrated dumbwaiter elevator. It leads directly to the lowest level of the royal apartments.

#### Servant's Passage

This door is [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and opened via the servant's password. The narrow tunnel leads to the Servant's Lodge in the Lower Bailey.

#### Water Spring

Water flows into this large pool from several narrow pipes connected to the city aqueducts. The once-fresh water is contaminated, inhabited by two [animated delerium sludges](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/animated-delerium-sludge-dodk.md).

#### Canal

Water from the cistern pool flows into a downward-sloping canal with a small cleated pier for mooring a small boat or raft. A portcullis bars passage further; the canal terminates at another spring in Queen's Park. The gate opens only for a character bearing a Seal of Drakkenheim.

### Throne Room Antechamber

This ceiling of this magnificent antechamber rises sixty feet overhead, the top bordered by arched clerestory windows that allow natural light into the chamber. Two sets of broad marble steps with pillared banisters wrap around the room and converge at a central columned balcony thirty feet above the ground floor. Golden double doors each etched with the design of a dragon rampant upon a tower are set atop and below the balcony passage below it, and broad landings halfway up each staircase connect to halls heading north and south.

- Check for a random encounter each time characters pass through this chamber.  
- The steward uses his spells such as [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) to prevent characters from entering the throne room.  
- This chamber is the ground level of the central tower, but does not directly connect to the royal apartments.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/135-map-8.02-castle-drakken-towers-player.webp#gallery)

### Stair Tower

A brilliant chandelier extends down the height of this hollow one-hundred-fifty-foot-tall tower. Thousands of glass crystals with frames of silver and gold are arranged in patterns of constellations and stars. A wide and impressive spiral staircase glides up and down the length of the tower lined by a carved balustrade, exiting to the tower roof. There are four landings along the length of the stair: three connected to arched bridgeways. The stairs also descend to a lower level, where the sparkling chandelier light reflects from a large fountain at the tower's base.

- The stairs connect to the Ambassador's Tower, the Steward's Tower, and the Royal Apartments, the Antechamber, and the Vaults.  

#### Dragon Roost

The stairs continue and exit the top of the tower to the tower roof, which is a flat platform surrounded by battlements. [Minazorond](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/minazorond-dodk.md) uses this place as a roost.

### Conservatory Tower

Beyond the tower base, this one-hundred-fifty-foot-tall tower narrows considerably to a width of twenty feet as the spiral staircase makes its way upward.

#### Library

The musty smell of ancient books wafts through this room, lined floor to ceiling with shelves with a sliding ladder rail. This impressive collection includes rare works of poetry, literature, and history. A loft above contains a study where the monarch's children were instructed by a tutor.

#### Mage's Chamber

An [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) door on the middle level opens only for members of the Amethyst Academy. Inside is a private suite inhabited by 4 [arcane wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/arcane-wraith-dodk.md), the insane remnants of the last Academy representatives posted to Castle Drakken. Amongst their belongings are a rare magic item plus `1d4` rare potions and `1d6` rare [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of your choice.

#### Solarium

The topmost level is a fine glass-paned sitting room with perhaps one of the finest views of the landscape north of Drakkenheim. Elegant silver furniture with spiraling design and plush pillows provides a place for quiet relaxation.

### Steward's Tower

This one-hundred-foot-tall square tower connects to the Stair Tower via an arched and covered bridge. It can be accessed from the outside via the balconies and battlements.

#### Private Quarters

The top two levels of the tower are the private quarters for the steward and his family, consisting of a drawing room, personal study, and three bedrooms. The furnishing is comparatively modest next to the ostentatious decoration of the rest of the castle.

#### Steward's Office

The walls of this otherwise ordinary room are covered floor to ceiling in cabinets, bookshelves, chests of drawers, and a still-ticking grandfather clock. A massive oak desk covered in heavy tomes and papers dominates the room.

- Upon the desk is an unsent letter written in the steward's hand and bearing his seal addressed to Ulrich IV. It contains revealing details about an illegitimate heir to House von Kessel, including their name and possible location. The exact contents are up to you to decide based on how you've arranged the royal succession.  

#### Bureaucratic Archives

This cramped room has narrow aisles between tall rows of drawer cabinets and shelves. They contain detailed records of the city; including property deeds, noble titles, tax records, construction permits, royal decrees, diaries, succession laws, and years of correspondence and records. Any key information or clues helpful to the characters, factions, or their personal quests could conceivably be found here, but finding any specific document or information kept here would take days of searching, possibly even weeks. However, making a DC 25 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check allows a character to find one specific document with a one-hour search by piecing together how the material here is actually organized.

A secret door in the archives leads to a rough tunnel that connects to the wine cellar in the Chateau Kitchen.

### Ambassador's Tower

This tower is one hundred twenty feet tall and connects to the Stair Tower via a bridge.

#### Reception Chamber

This luxurious lounge served as a meeting area for more informal conversations between dignitaries.

#### Guest Apartments

The remaining levels of this tower contain several fine suites for important visitors and political hostages of the royal family with private bedrooms and common rooms.

#### The Emissary's Entourage

A scheming and sauve [erinyes](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/erinyes.md) known as the Emissary occupies the Ambassador's Tower with several other devils: two [horned devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md) and a bodyguard of 12 [bearded devils](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). The devils desperately wish to leave the mortal world and return to Hell (without being destroyed in the process). They believe that if they were to acquire mortal souls or a *Seal of Drakkenheim*, their hellish overlord will relent and pull them back to Hell. They tell the following diabolical lies:

- "We were summoned here by the will of the throne to receive an important message for our master. We are bound here until one who sits the throne gives us our mission."  
- "Ulrich IV lives. His horrific transformation may be undone by destroying the corrupted pillar in the crypts, but a powerful guardian protects it now."  
- "The steward is in fact a powerful lich. He conspired with demons to summon the meteor. He has locked himself in his tower. Do not listen to anything he says."  
- "The Prince of Carnage is Leonard von Kessel."  

#### The Devil's Bargain

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Our master is the Lord of Hell. All secrets are known to them. If you offer us your mortal soul or one of the Seals of Drakkenheim, we can contact them. Then, you may ask them three questions, and you will receive a truthful reply in kind."
^5ec

The Lord of Hell possesses true knowledge, and the deal is genuine. Characters could learn about the following:

- Identify a royal heir or where proof of lineage may be found.  
- Locate another *Seal of Drakkenheim* or a *Relic of Saint Vitruvio*.  
- Provide information needed to complete a personal quest.  
- Gain knowledge about one or more new spells in this book.  
- Explain the true origin of the meteor and the effects of the Haze.  

A character who offers their mortal soul withers and dies immediately, and can't be raised unless their soul is freed. If a *Seal of Drakkenheim* is offered to the Emissary, it disappears in a puff of brimstone when placed in her hand, lost in the Lower Planes. Then the devils answer the first three questions they are asked truthfully, and are subsequently transported back to Hell.

### Royal Apartments

The two-hundred-foot-tall central tower of the palace contains the royal apartments. It is accessible by the Servant's Stair from the Basement Kitchens, or by a bridge from the Stair Tower. The royal apartments are spread over four floors. Each has a similar layout with a central hall and six rooms, connected by a staircase that runs across the floors.

#### Attendant's Room

These small rooms and closets were used by servants waiting on the royal family, and are connected via the Servant's Stair to the Basement Kitchen. They contain fine shelves and cabinets used to store linens, cleaning supplies, cutlery, a small pantry, wine rack, and a cot for servants working the night shift.

#### Baths

Two rooms in the apartments contain large, elegant porcelain clawfoot bathtubs. Levers beside gold-painted spouts cause water to fill the tub when a stopper is placed over the drain.

#### Bedchambers

There are a dozen bedchambers across the four floors of the royal apartments. Each has a large sumptuous bed with a satin canopy, silk sheets, plush pillows, and soft velvet carpets, and a hearth or heating stove. The carved headboards have gold filigree and embedded pearls. Candelabras, chandeliers, and nightstands are made of gold or silver.

#### Dining Room

The royal family took most meals in this elegant dining room. The carved dining table has a glass top and is a work of art in its own right.

#### Dressing Rooms

About half the bedchambers have an adjoining dressing room appointed with broad wardrobes, dressing tables, and large framed mirrors. Lockboxes with wigs, jewellry, trinkets, and rotting makeup are scattered throughout.

#### Water Closets

Three curious rooms in the apartment floors each contain a porcelain bowl set with a cushioned hoop-shaped seat and attached to a tank of water. Pulling a nearby metal chain causes water from the tank to flood the bowl and carry waste away into the castle plumbing. The water-closet on the penthouse level is plated with gold.

#### Sitting Room

Velvet couches and two great leather wingback chairs flank either side of an impressive fireplace. Thick carpets with intricate designs are laid out beneath, and a square polished marble table with streaks of gold is set in the middle of the room. A warm fire illuminates the room.

#### Penthouse

The topmost floor is the private penthouse used by the monarch and ringed by battlements with an impressive view. It includes an impressive bed, and the rest of the level includes its own bathroom, water closet, short hallway, dressing room, and study. The Regent (see below) has made this chamber his personal lair, and it's now in a state between lavish and squalor. The [Shield of the Sacred Flame](Mechanics/items/the-shield-of-sacred-flame-dodk.md) is here.

#### Royal Study

This seldom used chamber nevertheless has an impressive desk and bookshelves lined with aspirational reading material.

#### Rooftop Garden

The battlements have observational parapets and flower boxes filled with lavenders that housed a royal apiary and falcon's roost. These majestic creatures have been slaughtered, and now eight [hypnotic eldritch blossoms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/hypnotic-eldritch-blossom-dodk.md) occupy the flowerbeds. `1d4` [vrocks](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md) may also be fluttering around the spire.

#### Escape Chute

The fireplace in the sitting room and the penthouse bedchamber has a false back. When pressed inward and slid upward, it opens into a narrow drop chute with a metal sliding pole. Sliding down the pole leads to the Dungeon Vault.

#### The Regent's Retinue

A gluttonous [nalfeshnee](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nalfeshnee.md) known as the Regent conducts depraved and debauched acts in the royal apartments with his retinue of demons: a [marilith](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/marilith.md), `1d4` [glabrezu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md), `1d6` [vrocks](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/vrock.md), and dozens of servile [quasits](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md). These creatures can be encountered anywhere in the royal apartments, and relish in transforming the regal appointments into a place of gory grandeur. They have no desire to leave Castle Drakken. Instead, they want to gain control of the dimensional rift to summon more demons. They believe they can accomplish this by stealing mortal souls and drawing power from holy relics. They tell the following demonic lies:

- "We were summoned here by the will of the throne, and are bound to keep the castle. Only one who sits upon the throne may discharge us from our servitude."  
- "Ulrich IV lives. His mind is bound to the disfigured flesh before the throne, and his will alone contains the Haze. If you destroy him, it will consume the world."  
- "The meteor was in fact a diabolical vessel that crashed here. The devils arrived in Drakkenheim from a portal to Hell in the crater."  
- "The Rat Prince is Leonard von Kessel."  

#### Demonic Sacrifice

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The king is not strong enough to defeat the Haze on his own. However, we will show you how to help him, but it requires you sacrifice your mortal life... and give up the Relics of Saint Vitruvio."
^5fc

The demons use the guise of civility to lure characters into a trap where they can use them as a living sacrifice or steal one of the *Relics of Saint Vitruvio* from them. Though they explain the rite will break the power of the Amalgamation, it's a total lie. Instead, the demons gleefully murder any characters who submit to them and use the relic in their profane summoning rites.

## Throne Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This sovereign chamber has a grandiose vaulted ceiling sixty feet overhead and is ringed by magnificent columns supporting a stately balcony halfway up the height of the room. Throughout are countless detailed architectural ornamentations of gold inlaid with emeralds that accent Intricate painted murals depicting regal scenes of glorious conquest. Fleshy tendrils entwine the pillars, twitching membranes stretch across the room, and massive delerium crystals burst through the marble tiled floor. The tall arched windows that lined the walls and galleries have burst inward; whatever intricate designs they once bore shattered amongst pieces of sharp glass floating in the air around each. Instead, the openings look out upon bizarre vistas.
^5fe

- The throne room is accessed via the royal antechamber. The rooftop attic rises twenty feet above that outside, and from outside the building, the windows appear intact and opaque.  
- Stumbling around the balcony are 14 (`4d6`) [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) in shredded courtier's outfits.  

### The Throne of Drakkenheim

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Upon a three-tiered marble platform surrounded by a balustrade and flanked by warped statues of mighty knights is the Throne of Drakkenheim. This imperial throne is fixed into the structure of Castle Drakken, and fashioned from granite and embellished with wrought-iron, marble, and golden filigree. Its broad claw-shaped armrests are embedded with gemstones. The cushions are upholstered in rich hues of deep green.
> 
> A colossal dragon skull adorns the top of the chair, and skeletal wings rise up from the throne. These once framed a breathtaking circular rose window decorated with prismatic tracery, but instead forms a turbulent eldritch portal beyond which lies an unfathomable landscape.
^600

- Above the throne is the dimensional rift, which leads to the Space Between Worlds. This churning chaos is the source of all magic and metaphysically connected to every other dimension, plane, and reality. Characters may enter the Space Between Worlds through this portal, but are struck by [feeblemind](Mechanics/spells/feeblemind.md) (DC 20) in the process. Those who fail this save are driven mad. See the "Developments" section for details on what lies beyond.  
- The throne is a magical artefact in its own right and indestructible while the castle stands.  
- While seated on the throne, a character attuned to the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) may use an action to cast the following spells:  
- > [!readaloud]   
    >   
    > At-will—[command](Mechanics/spells/command.md) (DC 20)  
    >   
    > 1/day each—[globe of invulnerability](Mechanics/spells/globe-of-invulnerability.md), [mind blank](Mechanics/spells/mind-blank.md) (self only), [stoneskin](Mechanics/spells/stoneskin.md) (self only)  
    >   
    > 3/day—[sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md)  
    ^601  
- The *Throne of Drakkenheim* is irreversibly contaminated whilst the Haze remains. A humanoid creature seated on the throne can't regain hit points, and each time a creature activates its powers, they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gain one level of Contamination.

#### The Amalgamation

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Before the throne is a gibbering amalgamation of fleshy tumors, rotting bones, and rancid layers of bloated fat suspended between the ceiling and floor by stalky strands of gnarled tissue. The mass is covered in bursting sores, shuddering mucus nodules, and weeps bile and delerium sludge, The creature mutters in alien tongues from six yawning mouths, piping and sputtering in discordant musical tones, and lazily shifting eyes of massive size open and close throughout its bulk. Thick trunk-like tentacles reach out from its hideous stinking form to squirm and writhe around the chamber. Several appendages are wrapped around pulsing human organs: lungs, liver, kidney, a heart, a brain, and dangling amongst them is the jewelled Crown of Westemär. A palpable aura of contamination emanates from the beast.
^603

- The [Amalgamation](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/amalgamation-dodk.md) and `2d6` [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) are here, and slavishly attack any who enter the throne room.  
- While the physical remains of Ulrich IV have become part of the Amalgamation, his mind and soul are forever annihilated.  
- If the amalgamation is destroyed, it returns with all its hit points after `1d10` days unless the dimensional rift is closed.

> Even my fondest childhood memories of Castle Drakken can't shake the feeling of dread when the shadow looms heavy over the haze.

## Dungeons of Drakkenheim

The dungeon vaults are accessed through the Stair Tower. Instead of the gilded finery and impressive paintings of the upper chambers, the dungeons are decorated with solemn statuary, mosaic brickwork, detailed bas-relief carvings, and ribbed and vaulted ceilings twenty feet overhead.

### Pool of Tears

The base of the Stair Tower houses a glimmering marble fountain. Three mischievous [gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) are bound to the fountain, nicknamed Cheeky, Rump, and Bazoo. They are friendly to passersby and speak common if addressed. They don't know much about what's happened in the castle, but many years ago they saw the steward run down into the dungeons. He never returned.

### Escape Chute Base

This dusty chimney is the base for the escape chimneys in the Royal Apartments. The sliding pole ends about four feet from the ground.

### Heroes' Hall

The statues lining this hallway honor adventurers and heroes who performed great deeds for the royal family, which should be subtly described as having the likenesses of your players' past characters (if appropriate). Two can be pushed aside easily for access to the secret passages.

### Vault Watchers

Guarding the way to the royal vaults and crypts are two [stone golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md). The steward once attempted to take control of them, but ended up scrambling the arcane commands that bound them to the castle. They haltingly stumble around their posts and attack anyone who enters.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/140-map-8.04-castle-drakken-dungeons-player.webp#gallery)

### Royal Vaults

The wealth of Westemär rests behind these large, tightly sealed iron doors: there are no handles, locks, hinges, or seams. Each chamber is warded with [private sanctum](Mechanics/spells/mordenkainens-private-sanctum.md); the doors are [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and immune to all damage. The vault doors slide open when touched by one who wears the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md), or three characters attuned to the *Seals of Drakkenheim*.

- The royal vaults contain an incredible treasure of nearly 35,000 gold pieces in heavy gold bullion and silver talents, neatly stacked.  
- A gemstone collection of 6 emeralds, 4 diamonds, 7 rubies, and 8 sapphires, worth 1,000 gp each. Resting as the crowning jewel amongst these is the *Diamond of Mount Kadath*.  
- A collection of magically notarized, preserved, and sealed bonds, credit notes, financial agreements, and property deeds involving staggering sums and distant foreign powers. These pieces of paper are the *true* wealth of House von Kessel.  
- Jewelry boxes containing a sapphire amulet, diamond necklace, sapphire tiara, and a ruby-encrusted circlet each worth 2,500 gp.  
- The final chamber houses one very rare magic item and one rare magic item of your choice, and a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md).  

### Monarchal Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The royal mausoleum is a fifty-foot-high chamber supported by two dozen rectangular columns. Gargantuan delerium crystals have breached through the walls and floors, and thick delerium sludge fills the hall to the knee's height, bubbling and hissing like a foul stew. The air is cold and stale.
> 
> Upon the sides of each pillar are five decorated niches roughly eight feet tall each. They are placed one atop another and separated by ornate borders. Some are empty, but many others hold a life-sized sculpture of a former monarch of Drakkenheim. Each is cast with a regal countenance and idealized features; each holds an object symbolizing their legacy and is flanked by candelabras. Horrifyingly, the outer shells of the statues are crumbling away, revealing exposed muscle and weeping tissue beneath. Some murmur from mouths half-stone and half-flesh. Rays of prismatic light illuminate the chamber from a bulbous form that floats and bobs between the pillars.
^60d

- The [Gravekeeper](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gravekeeper-dodk.md) attacks if it detects any trespassers in this chamber.  
- Delerium sludge floods the floor - characters within must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. They take 42 (`12d6`) necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one level of contamination  
- A plaque below each statue names each monarch with dates of their life and rule, beginning with King Vladimir von Drakken and ending with Queen Helena von Kessel II, Ulrich IV's mother. There are roughly sixty monarchs interred here across five distinct family dynasties. with reigns ranging from decades to days. Behind each statue is a small sealed sepulcher that holds their skulls and ashes. The outer walls are lined with covered sepulchral drawers holding the remains of other royal family members.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/141-08-005.doundation-pillar.webp#center)

#### Foundation Pillar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large alcove on the left-hand side of the chamber features a heavily damaged granite pillar. Unlike the others, it is cylindrical, etched with arcane runes, and appears on the brink of collapse. However, the deep cracks are held together by pulsing tendrils of living stone emerging from a peculiar lump of melted rock latched to the pillar like a leech.
^60f

- The Foundation Pillar is the power source for the castle wards. It is magically connected to the *Seals of Drakkenheim*, the *Throne of Drakkenheim*, and the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md). These magic items lose their magical properties if the Foundation Pillar is destroyed.  
- The dimensional rift is drawing out its immense magic to fuel its growth. If the steward wasn't holding the pillar together to slow this process, the rift would destructively spill open and destroy the castle.  
- Johann Eisner fled here after failing to save Ulrich IV when the Haze overtook Castle Drakken fifteen years ago, He was about to undergo a monstrous transformation when he laid his hands upon the foundation pillar. He has become fused to it as a result, and this accident granted him limited control over its magic. He can't be freed without slaying him, except by a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell. A creature within five feet of the foundation pillar can see his face merged within the melted rock. The steward can speak in a halting whisper to characters here.  
- The foundation pillar has AC 20 and 250 hit points. It is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapon attacks.  
- If Eisner is freed from the pillar while the dimension rift remains open, the foundation pillar crumbles in twenty four hours, and Castle Drakken is destroyed by the rift.

## Closing the Dimensional Rift

The rift can be sealed in three ways:

- A [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell (such as one used from the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md)).  
- Investing the power of the *Seals of Drakkenheim* into the steward (see Eternal Custodian).  
- Physically travelling into the rift and destroying the Amalgamation again on the other side.  

The Haze will eventually tear open more rifts as it expands beyond the city, but this is the only one in Drakkenheim... for now.

## Beyond the Dimensional Rift

The Space Between Worlds is a roiling non-place. The rift manifests on the other side as an abrupt tear in the peripheral perception. A pernicious beam of multihued light stretches across the effulgent sky, marking a distant place beyond an impossible horizon where the Amalgamation's multitudinous manifestations converge. There is no meaningful concept of time in the Space Between Worlds - it is beyond the perception of mortal creatures - so reaching that place is a journey of eons that unfolds in only `1d10` minutes of time in the mortal world. Nevertheless, should an intrepid band make the journey and destroy the Amalgamation here as well, the dimensional rift closes one round of apparent time later. Any characters left behind in the Space Between Worlds must find another means back, but the scope of such adventures is beyond this book.

## Eternal Custodian

Johann Eisner believes Drakkenheim is forever cursed, and has resigned himself to be its jailer. When he meets the characters, Eisner explains how it might be possible for him to close the dimensional rift if he is invested with the power of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*:

- Accomplishing this task requires each of the six *Seals of Drakkenheim* and the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) to be pressed against the foundation pillar.  
- This will attune Eisner to the Seals, but won't grant him the full powers of the throne or the crown since a coronation ritual isn't performed. He is only able to pacify the [wall gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) and [tower dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) so they don't attack humanoid creatures anymore, but instead attack monsters who come near. However, he is able to use this power to close the dimension rift.  
- If Eisner dies or another creature attunes to the crown, the rift reopens.  

## Coronation Ceremony

This special ceremony takes two hours to perform and requires seven participants. During this time, one participant (the "heir") must sit upon the *Throne of Drakkenheim* wearing the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md). The other six participants must each be attuned to a different *Seal of Drakkenheim*. The ritual fails immediately if any participant becomes [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), moves more than thirty feet away from the throne, or if the heir does not remain seated on the throne for the duration.

One after the other, each participant attuned to a *Seal* must approach the throne, pledge their allegiance, and offer their lifelong service to the new monarch. Each then makes a DC 20 ability check using an ability score that corresponds to their *Seal of Drakkenheim*:

- [Lord Commander's Badge](Mechanics/items/lord-commanders-badge-dodk.md) (Strength)  
- [Steward's Seal](Mechanics/items/stewards-seal-dodk.md) (Constitution)  
- [Spymaster's Signet](Mechanics/items/spymasters-signet-dodk.md) (Dexterity)  
- [Inscrutable Staff of the Archmage](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) (Intelligence)  
- [High Flamekeeper's Phylactery](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md) (Wisdom)  
- [Chancellor's Crest](Mechanics/items/chancellors-crest-dodk.md) (Charisma)  

The designated heir responds to each ability check by making an appropriate check of their own using the same ability score. While all 12 checks must be attempted to finish the ceremony, only 8 successful check results are needed to successfully complete it and attune the heir to the crown. Encourage each character participating in the ritual to roleplay out their vow, and the response of the monarch to each.

Since the throne is contaminated, each failed ability check causes the designated heir to immediately take 14 (`4d6`) psychic damage. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination. Failure by 5 or more causes the heir to take 35 (`10d6`) damage and gain `1d4` levels of contamination instead. Remember, a creature can't regain hit points while seated on the throne! If the heir is transformed into a monster or reduced to 0 hit points, they immediately transform into another [Amalgamation](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/amalgamation-dodk.md).

### NOTE

Not every Seal needs to be worn by a player character: the characters might choose one or more faction leaders or other key non-player characters to wear the Seals. In such cases, these NPCs should offer their hopes for the future, express their gratitude to the player characters, and celebrate their accomplishments. You might even allow the players to make dice rolls for them.

## Be careful what you wish for...

No matter how carefully worded, it's well beyond the power of [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) to instantaneously or fully cleanse Drakkenheim of all contamination, delerium, and the Haze. A wish can restore the original form of a single creature who suffered a monstrous transformation, however.

## Lost Seals

Characters foolish enough to offer a *Seal of Drakkenheim* to the devils have effectively doomed any hope for restoring the throne properly. Perhaps such characters could mount an expedition to Hell to retrieve the *Seal* on an adventure of your own creation!
