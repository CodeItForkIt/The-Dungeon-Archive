# Chapter 2: Running the Campaign
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 8* 

*Dungeons of Drakkenheim* is a nonlinear adventure that combines urban exploration and faction conflict, bound together by the personal quests of the player characters. Early in the campaign, your players might closely follow the story overview described below. As they advance further into the city and interact with the factions, their decisions will reshape the story in unpredictable ways.

This book contains inspiration, guidelines, and tools to help you adjudicate and respond to your player characters' actions as they explore Drakkenheim. Running an exciting and dynamic nonlinear adventure requires sound judgement and good use of logic on your part. You should feel empowered to make changes so your players have a rewarding and challenging experience. Occasionally, you may even need to devise your own material or repurpose adventure hooks, characters, and locations to better suit the changing conditions in your campaign.

## Story Overview

The characters arrive in Drakkenheim to pursue their personal quests or a few freelance missions from friendly contacts in Emberwood Village. They face ravenous [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md), malfeasant wizards, and rival adventurers in the Outer City Ruins. During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and find a way deeper into the city.

As the characters learn more about the factions' differing ideologies, the various faction leaders take notice of their progress. Once the characters successfully traverse the City Walls and begin exploring the Inner City Ruins, each leader approaches the characters for help with their objectives. They appeal to the characters' Ideals and Bonds, offer resources and support, and promise crucial assistance with the characters' personal quests.

However, as the characters collaborate with the factions to advance their mutual goals, they become increasingly entangled in the political machinations between the competing groups. Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous peace won't last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the crater. Characters may unearth stunning revelations from Drakkenheim's past and recover powerful artifact which threaten the balance of power between the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.

The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken. There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim.

## Character Advancement

Character advancement in Drakkenheim may be handled by using traditional experience points. In addition to earning XP for defeating monsters, you should award additional experience points (equal to the reward for defeating a level-appropriate monster) whenever characters:

- Finish a personal quest  
- Complete a faction mission  
- Slay a legendary monster (either a monster or faction leader)  
- Obtain a *Seal of Drakkenheim* or a *Relic of Saint Vitruvio*  
- Discover secret information about the meteor or Drakkenheim  

Alternatively, you can choose to dispense with tracking experience points and simply decide when the characters gain a level.

The flowchart shows a possible path characters may take through their adventures in Drakkenheim, along with suggested levels to provide an appropriate challenge for the characters. Use this as a guideline for how fast characters should advance, and award character levels when they complete a personal quest or major faction mission.

### Adventure Flowchart

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/adventure-flowchart.webp#center)

### Deadly Challenges

Drakkenheim is a dangerous place. Not every combat encounter is fairly balanced in a level-appropriate manner. Deadly threats lurk down every street, and many scenarios intentionally stack the odds against the player characters. They must use cunning, ingenuity, and teamwork to survive and seek the aid of the factions to accomplish their most important goals.

### Character Death

Characters looking to revive a slain companion have limited options. Few non-player characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, and the expensive material components are rare. Prominent members of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire can cast [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md) and other higher level spells. Consult the Faction Boons section in chapter 3 regarding each respective faction for details on what each faction requires. Characters might also seek out the druid of the Shrine of Morrigan (see chapter 6). Finally, [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md), [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md), and [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md) may be found as treasure in various locations in the city, usually the chapels and cathedrals. At your option, the characters may find another scroll elsewhere in the ruins.

Regardless, the players may need to create a replacement character, or play one temporarily. A player may easily create a new arrival to Emberwood Village to replace a slain character, or perhaps be encountered as the lone survivor of another adventuring party. Alternatively, they might play a faction member assigned to the party as a reinforcement.

## Origins of the Meteor

> [!quote] A quote from Archwizard Ryan Greymere  
> 
> Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances, magical energies crystallize into delerium. The stones slowly draw more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities, and alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more leakage occurs around vast quantities of delerium. These chaotic energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as the Haze. More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates.

The meteor left behind vast deposits of delerium, enough to manifest an erratic magical field called the **Haze**. New delerium deposits gradually emerge within the Haze, which causes the affected region to expand slowly over time. Left unchecked, the Haze can overtake an entire world within a few centuries, leaving behind a chaotic landscape of churning madness and wild magic. The infected world cataclysmically shatters when more destructive magic inevitably erupts, sending a hail of delerium-filled comets throughout the cosmos. After hurtling through the Astral Void for eons, some collide with new worlds where the process begins again. Countless worlds have met this fate, the rest are wholly ignorant of the doom that might one day descend upon them.

If nothing is done to stop the spread, the Haze will fully engulf Westemär in roughly one hundred and fifty years. Once this happens, little hope for reversal remains, and the dread mists will envelop the world two centuries thereafter. Civilization and society collapse into a monster-filled wasteland that catastrophically ruptures about one thousand years later.

None know the complete truth about the Haze at the outset of the campaign, and little knowledge is revealed via divination magic save mad whispers. Throughout the adventure, player characters may find clues about delerium from which they may develop their own theories and speculations regarding the origins of the meteor. They can learn much by exploring deep into the ruins, especially locations such as the Inscrutable Tower, the crater, and Castle Drakken. Faction leaders and malfeasant wizards might also offer their research and insights to help players along the way.

## Fall of House von Kessel

House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for one hundred fifty years. The last monarch, Ulrich IV, inherited a period of relative political stability, and so pursued interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess, Lenore, and they had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza. Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck Drakkenheim. The King, his wife, and their children were never seen again after that day, but their true fate remains a mystery.

However, many members of the royal household were not in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the King's younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.

### The Royal Family

Since the royal household were recognizable public figures in their lifetimes, any character proficient in [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) instantly recognizes them in artwork or portraits.

- **King Ulrich von Kessel IV.** was a portly man of average height with a wiry beard and rather unremarkable features, artwork often exaggerates his appearance with a heroic barrel chest, a lush curly beard, and a regal countenance. Stately artwork shows him clad in a royal mantle wearing the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md). Those who knew the King in life remember him as a capable if overindulgent ruler who left most matters of state to his administrators.  
- **Queen Lenore von Kessel.** was a woman in her late thirties; six feet tall with graceful limbs, hair dyed bright orange, and bleached white skin. Her face had chiseled and angular features, and with every gesture she struck a pose. She wore outrageously ornamented gowns and jewelry, including a famous golden necklace set with eleven emeralds.  
- **Leonard von Kessel.** was eighteen years old when the meteor struck, but would be thirty three years old now. Leonard took to military interests at a young age. Artwork often depicts him as an aristocratic young soldier with sandy brown hair wearing a dragon-decorated breastplate and wielding a longsword.  
- **Katarina von Kessel.** was an inquisitive and acrobatic eleven-year-old with wide eyes and auburn hair. She typically wore a frilled shirt, fitted trousers, and cape instead of dresses, and had a penchant for stealing hats. She would now be twenty six years old.  
- **Eliza von Kessel.** was only six years old at the time of the disaster. The button-nosed child was usually dressed in a bonnet and patterned dress. Assuming she survived, she would be twenty one years old today.  

### A Long Lost Heir

None have yet discovered that King Ulrich von Kessel IV and Queen-Consort Lenore von Kessel were both transformed into monsters. Ulrich is now part of the hideous [Amalgamation](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/amalgamation-dodk.md) in Castle Drakken, and [Lenore](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lenore-von-kessel-dodk.md) has become a mad creature hiding in Queen's Park. Their children haven't been seen in fifteen years. It's up to you to decide whether or not they survived, and where they might be found.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/002-01-002.family-portrait.webp#center)

Beyond the immediate offspring of Ulrich IV, however, many relatives and cadet branches exist. As such, the House von Kessel family tree has been left intentionally vague so you and your players may freely insert your own player and non-player characters as potential heirs. They need not be one of Ulrich's known children, but instead illegitimate offspring, a grandchild, niece, nephew, or other family relative. The most dramatically compelling possibilities include:

- One or more player characters (known or unbeknownst to them)  
- A close relative of a player character (offspring, half-sibling, cousin, or niece/nephew)  
- The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) or a faction lieutenant (see the NPCs entries for specific ideas)  

Furthermore, there is no need for there to be a single surviving heir, or even any at all. Anyone can say they have royal blood. It's another matter to prove it, and gain the support to actually take the crown. Finally, it's possible another noble household could gain sufficient political clout and military power to turn a tenuous claim into a credible one, and simply supplant House von Kessel entirely.

#### Complications

At the outset of the campaign there is no heir apparent to the throne, nor have any credible claimants to the throne stepped forward. There are many reasons why a potential claimant to the throne hasn't emerged yet. Decades of affairs, disaster, and war have ravaged the public records, and conclusively determining heredity via magical means requires the blood or remains of Ulrich IV. While an heir could possess a locket, signet ring, or some other document, this must be substantiated with something from the ruins to prove their identity and ancestry. Consider introducing one of the following additional complications:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/003-01-003.meteorite-delerium.webp#center)

- Kept as a long-forgotten prisoner in an iron helmet in the Queen of Thieves' dungeon.  
- Grew up adopted; no idea about their true parentage.  
- Working as a humble stablehand living in Emberwood Village.  
- Secretly hidden and protected by a distant noble house.  
- [Petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) into a statue in Castle Drakken.  
- Accidentally banished to another plane.  
- Succumbed to contamination; transformed into a monster.  
- Secretly an arcane spellcaster; disinherited under the Edicts of Lumen. (See Appendix E)  
- Target of an assassination attempt by faction agents; have been hiding since.  
- Born from an affair; their birth was kept secret to conceal a scandal.  

## Embracing the Unknown

What has happened to Drakkenheim is simply a cosmic accident. It is not the intentional work of an inscrutable extraplanar being, nor did any chortling demon lord or scheming evil deity set these events in motion. Instead, it is more akin to a natural disaster, albeit one caused by the magical forces that underscore the cosmos. Much like an earthquake, hurricane, or volcano, the calamitous forces that cause such magical catastrophes are entirely beyond mortal means to control or reverse. This fact may come as a surprise to players who expect they can simply defeat some tangible evil entity and save the world. However, the dark fantasy and cosmic horror literature that inspired this adventure rarely ends in such clear-cut ways. Instead, the heroic actions of the player characters may avert further disaster, but will never erase the damage that has already been done.

While outwardly presenting a tantalizing mystery, the meteor functions more as a catalyst for conflict in Drakkenheim. My players failed to fully uncover the origins of the meteor during their adventures, but our campaign still had an immensely satisfying conclusion. In fact, themes of cosmic horror and madness are greatly enhanced when the real answers are never fully understood.

### The Seals of Drakkenheim

These six wondrous items were entrusted to the royal council of Westemär. Each identifies the bearers as important administrative and political figureheads. In addition to their potent magical powers (described in Appendix D), the seals have an important purpose in a special coronation ritual that attunes a new monarch to the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) itself (described in chapter 9). As such, many factions seek these seals, which are thought lost in the ruins. A few are already in the hands of several faction agents however! Here's where you can find them though:

#### Chancellor's Crest

Balrin Barthes failed to escape Drakkenheim, and was transformed into a monster. This mutated wretch still wears the Chancellor's Crest, and serves the horrific Duchess deep in its lair below the cistern.

#### Inscrutable Staff

Adriana Modiera, the Archmage of Drakkenheim, died within the Inscrutable Tower. This mighty magical staff remains there today. Traditionally, the Amethyst Academy has the right to determine who holds this staff.

#### Lord Commander's Badge

[Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) survived the fall of Drakkenheim and spent years fighting in the Civil War before taking charge of the Hooded Lanterns. He still holds his original badge of office.

#### Saint Vitruvio's Phylactery

High Flamekeeper Gregora led the faithful in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio. Her true fate is unknown, but now a monstrous [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) priest carries the phylactery in the cathedral. It is traditionally entrusted to the highest ranking cleric of the Sacred Flame in Drakkenheim, as this item is also one of the Relics of Saint Vitruvio.

#### Spymaster's Signet

Spymaster Magdalena Vasari was a half-elf assassin. A loyal operative through-and-through, Vasari took advantage of her assumed death to secretly seek any surviving heirs of the royal family during the Civil War. She may have succeeded had she not been killed and her signet ring stolen by the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) several years ago.

#### Steward's Seal

Johann Eisner, the royal steward, became trapped in Castle Drakken after failing to rescue Ulrich IV. However, he entrusted his young daughter with hiding his seal as a precaution for this exact predicament. While her fate is now unknown, the seal is now amongst the treasures of the [Crimson Countess](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crimson-countess-dodk.md) in the Cosmological Clocktower.

## Running Personal Quests

These adventure hooks give the players their own personal objectives for venturing into the ruins. Players might choose one of the quests presented in chapter 1, or you may work with the player to invent one of your own design.

The personal quests have been kept open-ended so you can work with your players to deeply customize them. You should feel free to integrate unexpected twists or complications along the way, and establish strong connections to the city, events, and factions in the process. Here's a few suggestions for how these quests might proceed:

### Find a Cure

The character's relative may be found in an area of the Deep Haze: near the Inscrutable Tower, Queen's Park, the crater, or perhaps in thrall to the Duchess or the [Pale Man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md). Unfortunately, they are indeed mad, and once found resist capture and constantly try to escape. A monstrous transformation can be reversed in three ways: using a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell, by [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) performing a divine intervention, or by researching the [siphon contamination](Mechanics/spells/siphon-contamination-dodk.md) spell.

### Claim the Throne

This quest ties the character strongly to a central conflict in the campaign. A fun twist is introducing a rival adventurer with an equally valid claim. Consult that section for more details. This character could even be one of the children of Ulrich IV.

### An Apocalyptic Vision

This character will need to seek out the means to survive the most contaminated area in the city. Once they reach the heart of the crater, the character has another apocalyptic vision when they touch the Delerium Heart. The character must now decide what they will do to save the world.

### Faction Aspirant

Advancement in a faction requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction. Achieving this quest happens when a faction's leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant, and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between the characters!

### A Score to Settle

This is a very difficult personal quest, but a straightforward one. The faction leaders are all well-protected and formidable in their own right, though [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) and [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) are significantly easier to encounter in person. Characters targeting the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) or [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) are in for a vexing challenge!

### Arcane Secrets

These spells can be learned from [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md), the [Pale Man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md), Ryan Greymere and spellbooks contained within the Inscrutable Tower; the character must seek knowledge from each. Collecting these spells raises the ire of the Amethyst Academy, who wish to keep knowledge of this magic secret. Characters can complete this quest by researching the [contaminated power](Mechanics/spells/contaminated-power-dodk.md) spell.

### The Blighted Landscape

After visiting each location, the character can research the [aqua expurgo potion](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), [neutralizing field](Mechanics/spells/neutralizing-field-dodk.md), and [contamination immunity](Mechanics/spells/contamination-immunity-dodk.md) spells respectively, even if they haven't met the other prerequisites to research these spells.

### A Family Matter

Captive or convert, the relative is found at a faction stronghold. They could even be one of the faction lieutenants! It is difficult to convince them to leave; they have to see the faction do something horrible with their own eyes.

### Overwhelming Debt

Rival adventurers, a Queen's Men strike team, or an assassin might be pursuing a bounty on the character. You may want to have the Queen of Thieves or the Amethyst Academy "acquire" the character's debt and use that as leverage over them!

### A Lost Heirloom

Any rare magic item is an appropriate heirloom, and you can choose any location in the city where the item is lost, although Reed Manor, the Kleinberg Estate, and Slaughterstone Square are good possibilities. If you'd really like to create complications, this item could be stolen by the Queen of Thieves or a rival adventurer, or could even be one of the Seals of Drakkenheim.

### Personal Pilgrimage

The ritual the character wishes to perform at each location need not be simple. Instead, it might be a time-consuming process that requires a rare offering and takes several hours to complete, or perhaps can only be performed at a certain time of day (either dawn or dusk). As such, the character will need the protection and support of their allies to stay safe during the rite.

### Monster Slayer

Suitable foes might include the [Rat Prince](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/rat-prince-dodk.md), the [Crimson Countess](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crimson-countess-dodk.md), the Duchess, the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md), the Prince of Carnage, a [grotesque gargant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/grotesque-gargant-dodk.md), or a [crater wurm](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crater-wurm-dodk.md).

### Finishing a Personal Quest

Upon completing a personal quest, a player character gains rewards as described in chapter 1. In addition, you should reward each character in the party experience points based on the advancement method you are using.

At your option, once a character completes their personal quest, you might work with the player to create a follow-up personal quest for them to reflect the character's ongoing and evolving story. Furthermore, if conditions emerge where a character either can't complete or decides to abandon their personal quest, you should work with the player to develop a new one.

### Creating a Custom Personal Quest

When designing a custom personal quest, keep the following principles in mind:

- The quest should require characters to explore one or more locations within the Inner City ruins. A character shouldn't be able to complete their personal quest too early. Conversely, a personal quest involving Castle Drakken likely can't be completed until late in the campaign.  
- It should present some sort of complication with one of the factions, or perhaps require the characters to seek help from the faction to complete their quest.  
- The quest should be specific and achievable, and not related to character advancement (such as reaching 10th level or taking a specific feat).  
- Be careful about using a "ticking clock" for a personal quest. While this can introduce a compelling complication, focus on long-term goals rather than extremely urgent matters.  

Players often suggest personal quests involving missing persons, lost objects, or revenge. Many example personal quests provided already cover such motivations, such as "A Family Matter'', "A Lost Heirloom", and "A Score to Settle". Ask players to consider these options first. Perhaps their idea can be easily adapted to work with one of these quests (or vice versa).

## Running the Factions

Five factions are struggling to control the ruins of Drakkenheim: the Hooded Lanterns, the Queen's Men, the Knights of the Silver Order, the Followers of the Falling Fire, and the Amethyst Academy. Each is commanded by a prominent faction leader, but the faction as a whole behaves like a major recurring NPC, except they are composed of many individuals working together who share the same ideology, goals, methods, and resources. Chapter 3: Factions describes the background, objectives, roleplaying traits, major NPCs, and assets of each faction. Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.

Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character's choices, but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.

Exploring the most dangerous locations in Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or inciting the ire) of one or more factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.

Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to keep each faction in play as long as possible. Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them. Embrace their creativity by responding with new challenges, and rewarding players when they succeed by having their allies recognize their accomplishments. The factions are equipped with the tools to help you escalate tension and raise the stakes of the conflict in interesting ways.

Many adventure sites provide hooks and missions connected to the factions you may use to prompt the characters to visit each area. Each location also details how the factions could respond to possible events and outcomes that may occur.

## Cast of Characters

**Lord Commander Elias Drexel** (grim leader of the Hooded Lanterns)

**Captain Ansom Lang** (determined Hooded Lanterns Lieutenant)

**Lieutenant Petra Lang** (hopeful Hooded Lanterns Lieutenant)

**Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal** (valiant leader of the Silver Order)

**High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed** (devoted Silver Order Lieutenant)

**Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver** (calculating leader of the Amethyst Academy)

**River** (pragmatic Amethyst Academy Lieutenant)

**Lucretia Mathias** (mystical prophet of the Falling Fire)

**Nathaniel Flint** (enthusiastic Falling Fire Lieutenant)

**Queen of Thieves** (enigmatic criminal mastermind)

**Blackjack Mel** (sleazy Queen's Men Lieutenant)

**King Ulrich von Kessel IV** (monarch of Drakkenheim, assumed deceased)

**Queen-Consort Lenore von Kessel** (royal consort, assumed deceased)

**Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza von Kessel** (royal heirs, fate unknown)

### Negotiating an Alliance

Despite their conflicts, the faction leaders know they can't achieve their goals on their own. Not only do they seek the aid of the player characters, many factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.

The factions have been designed such that a long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a short-term truce involving three is difficult but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don't always act in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will inevitably collapse.

Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Queen's Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to manipulate the player characters and the other factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical moment. Especially cunning characters might help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal betrayal against an unsuspecting ally which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.

Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may compromise the trust they earn with an individual faction. They won't receive the greatest boons the faction can offer, and faction agents don't trust characters with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of double-agents, and would much rather see the player characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player characters should constantly be called upon to demonstrate their loyalty.

### Resolving the Conflict

Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor's origins will not unite the factions. Instead, these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups since they deeply disagree on the best way to address the problem. Given that The Haze threatens to overtake the entire world, it may at first appear the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed. Throughout the campaign however, the feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt. You should strive to contrast this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy which insists arcane means may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic prophecies of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival factions should present a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any "correct" answer: It's up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to act.

As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is inevitable, who exactly is present for that battle and the outcomes that may arise are unforeseeable. Chapter 10: The Fate of Drakkenheim describes a few possibilities.

## Rival Adventurers

Drakkenheim attracts all manner of would-be heroes and fortune-seekers. Characters may often encounter these rival adventurers during the campaign as recurring NPCs, both within the ruins and in Emberwood Village. At any given time, there might be as many as a dozen other groups exploring Drakkenheim, perhaps more.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/005-01-005.lock.webp#center)

Rivals may be competitive and quarrelsome, or friendly and sporting. Either way, good rivals spur the characters into action and create unique roleplaying opportunities. You might even invite a player to establish a pre-existing relationship between their character and a rival during character creation. Friendly rival adventurers might interact with characters in the following ways:

- Prompt the characters to recount their own stories and deeds  
- Share rumours and gossip with the characters  
- Suggest the characters visit a specific adventure site or take on a new mission  
- Challenge the characters to a contest (such as archery, wrestling, magical displays, drinking, slaying a monster, finding a treasure, or a duel)  
- Team up with the characters to take on a difficult objective  

Alternatively, some rival adventurers might be more hostile towards the characters:

- Trash-talk and humiliate the characters in Emberwood Village  
- Belittle the characters' accomplishments and insult their skills  
- Complete a quest or explore a location the characters have ignored  
- Act as reinforcements for an enemy faction  
- Take up a bounty on the characters  

The factions often hire adventuring parties to help achieve their goals. If the player characters don't take up a mission or offer, their leaders might turn to rival adventurers instead! It is also possible that rival adventurers could start as a friend or enemy, and end up the opposite!

### Rival Adventuring Parties

You can use the sample adventuring parties below, or create one of your own design.

When creating your own adventuring party, use pre-generated stat blocks from the Core Rules rather than spending time making character sheets for these NPCs like you would a player character. When it comes to making a good rival, interesting roleplaying traits are far more important than game statistics. A rival works well when they reflect the personalities and flaws of the player characters themselves, then exaggerate their best and worst qualities to the extreme while sharing some common ground. Diametrically opposing those traits tends to result in antagonists, not rivals. Flesh out such characters by pulling in one or two roleplaying traits from one of the backgrounds or personal quests presented in this book.

> My favourite game is to tell a group of adventurers where great treasure in the city is. Frankly, I have no idea where treasure is, but now they will stay out of my way.

#### Caspian Expedition

This expedition was dispatched by a Caspian noble house.

- Jupiter Jones is a barrel chested human [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) with a chiseled jaw and herculean features. Though he claims he's adventuring in Drakkenheim to bring glory to his name, he's actually on a personal quest to prove his family's connection to House von Kessel, as he is in fact Queen Lenore's nephew.  
- Lemminton Withalf, a greasy, misanthropic, and sniveling gnome bard (use the game statistics for a [scoundrel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) with bard spells instead of wizard spells) serves as herald.  
- A personal household guard of a dozen [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md).  

#### Heroic Veterans

This adventuring team has a small reputation in Drakkenheim. Its members include:

- Pluto Jackson, a human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md). This brash Caspian prince has come to Drakkenheim ostensibly to slay the greatest monsters in the city to make a name for himself. In truth, he's searching for proof his nephew is a legitimate heir to the throne.  
- Veo Sjena, a catfolk [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md). This mangy alleycat has survived in Drakkenheim for fifteen years and knows the city better than anyone. She's looking for any sign of her missing father.  
- Sebastian Crowe, a half-elf [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). This meddlesome and overconfident Academy dropout is haunted by nightmares of the meteor.  

#### Intrepid Explorers

These longtime friends have been adventuring together for years. They include a [berserker](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md), a [hedge mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md), a [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), and a [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md).

#### Foolhardy Rookies

These new arrivals might not last a day in Drakkenheim, but they've got spunk! The group consists of an [acolyte](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md), a [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), a [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md), and a [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md).

## Starting the Campaign

You can begin characters at 1st or 3rd level. We strongly recommend holding a Session Zero before starting the campaign. During this special session, make sure you achieve the following:

- Generate the player characters. Present players with the information included in the introduction to this book, especially the "Character Creation" section.  
- Share the appendices "The World of Drakkenheim" and "Character Backgrounds" with players who want to create characters with well-established connections to the setting.  
- Allow each player to choose a personal quest by sharing the table or cards with them. Remember, they need not disclose these to each other.  
- Ask the players to decide how their characters met and why they're working together. You can use the "Road to Drakkenheim" adventure below to bring the characters to the city itself.  
- Distribute one rumour to each player character using the tables or cards.  
- Share the Poster Map of Drakkenheim with the players.  

In addition, Session Zero is an important opportunity to establish a few expectations with your players about the campaign. We've created a video guide to Session Zero on our YouTube channel! Beyond scheduling and table etiquette, you should cover a few topics specific to this campaign:

- Discuss the themes of dark fantasy with your players by reviewing the content warning provided in the introduction of this book.  
- Highlight the warnings in the "Dangers of the Dark City" section in the introduction. You may wish to present the full rules for contamination to your players from Appendix C.  
- Players might react to the rules for contamination and the Haze by asking questions about whether or not their character abilities can protect them from these effects. Even if they propose something inventive, your answer should be a firm "no". Instead, explain they may discover new ways to overcome these problems during the adventure.  
- Remind your players the adventure occurs entirely within the bounds of Drakkenheim and its immediate environs. While the wider world gives context to the story, travelling outside Drakkenheim is beyond the scope of the campaign. Make a friendly agreement with your players that no matter what happens, their characters won't leave the area. If conditions emerge where it would make sense for a player character to depart the city, the player should play a new character until their previous one returns to Drakkenheim.  

After you've finished your Session Zero, begin your first game session with the introductory adventure, "The Road to Drakkenheim".

### Alternate Opening: Faction Contact

If you're beginning at 3rd level, you may instead begin the campaign with the player characters in direct contact with a faction lieutenant, who has hired them for a job in the Outer City described in chapter 6. We began the original *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* campaign with characters meeting River of the Amethyst Academy at Eckerman Mill, who hired them to recover a delerium crystal from the ruins of the Rat's Nest Tavern.

## The Road to Drakkenheim

> [!quote] A quote from Eren Marlowe, Provisioner  
> 
> You couldn't pay me any amount of money to go into that city, but there are people willing to risk it for the right price. Those people gotta eat, and honest folk can make good profit feeding them. Still, there's bastards who just wanna take it. That's where you come in.

If you wish to start with characters at 1st level and ease them into the campaign as a whole, begin with this short prelude. In this introduction, the characters are making their way towards Drakkenheim for the first time, accompanying a supply caravan bound for Emberwood Village. You can also use this opening to start characters at 3rd level, but you may wish to raise the difficulty of these encounters by adding additional creatures.

### Adventure Hook

#### Supplies for Emberwood Village

Though each has their own reasons for venturing into Drakkenheim, the characters have been hired by Eren Marlowe (a human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) to guard their caravan after the last group they hired stiffed them at the last minute. They'll pay each character 25 gold for the trip upon arrival in Emberwood Village. It's the perfect way to make some money as characters trek towards the city. The characters meet Eren Marlowe in the city of Altberg, which is the closest large city to Drakkenheim. It's a three week journey to the ruins.

### Eren Marlowe

Eren Marlowe is a lean person in their mid-forties with shoulder-length brown hair under a leather cap. They wear a slightly shabby woolen traveller's jacket and well-worn slacks. Chatty yet professional and with an opinion about everything, they enjoy having company on the road as much as they enjoy having the extra protection. As the characters travel along the road, Eren Marlowe asks each of them about their reasons for travelling to Drakkenheim, and how the characters met each other. This is a perfect opportunity to introduce the player characters, their relationships, and personal quests. In turn, Marlowe can share the following information with characters:

- They are bound for Emberwood Village, which is the only settlement within two weeks' travel of Drakkenheim that hasn't been abandoned. It is about five miles south of the dark city.  
- The increasing number of fortune-seekers, mercenaries, and prospectors exploring the ruins has turned the sleepy village into a boom town again.  
- Most farms and villages within one hundred miles of Drakkenheim have been abandoned. Crops and livestock don't grow anymore as the water and soil are contaminated by foul magic.  
- The folk of Emberwood Village rely on outside supplies entirely. Flamekeeper Hanna, a priest of the Sacred Flame, provides seed funds to attract the caravanners.  
- Once they arrive, Eren Marlowe will stay in Emberwood Village for a few weeks selling goods.  
- If characters are interested in heading into Drakkenheim, Marlowe offers to introduce them to their friend and frequent business partner, Armin Gainsbury, who runs a supply company in Emberwood Village. Armin sells useful adventuring equipment and can provide good advice about exploring the ruins.  

### Events on the Road

While most of the journey is uneventful, once characters are a few days from Drakkenheim, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> *After two weeks travelling on the road, the countryside turns dreary and desaturated. You pass many abandoned villages with dilapidated homes, crumbling farmsteads with sallow empty fields, and forests of dead trees. Thorny brambles and harsh scrubgrass are all that grow along the mud-slick road. Drizzling rain fills most days, and the wind howls at night. Aside from the creaking wagon wheels, you only hear the cawing of crows*.
^058

#### Marlowe's Caravan

Eren sits atop a large covered wagon pulled by two [draft horses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/draft-horse.md). It's packed with common provisions and trade goods: flour, salt, dried fruits, preserved meats, several jars of sauerkraut, a few casks of mead, a case of cheap wine, and a barrel of fresh water. The wagon also packs a few sets of common artisan's tools, [cook's utensils](Mechanics/items/cooks-utensils.md), empty waterskins, [climber's kits](Mechanics/items/climbers-kit.md), rope, and mining tools. Marlowe carries two [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) on their person for emergencies, and an extra [light crossbow](Mechanics/items/light-crossbow.md). Beneath a hidden plank in the wagon is a locked chest that contains 200 gold.

#### Bandit Shakedown

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> *"Oi, oi! Hold there, friends... you're travelling on a royal road, eh? In these troubled times it falls to loyal servants like ourselves to keep these highways free of reprobates and outlaws, eh? I'm afraid we'll need to collect a fee to ensure your safe passage to the capital, eh?"*
^05b

During one afternoon on the road, several cutthroats emerge from the ditches and rubble of a nearby farmhouse with crossbows at the ready.

Bogdan, a [thug](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) mounted on a [riding horse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md), leads four [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md): Hosh, Mildred, Sanna, and Mudface. They demand the horses, all the booze in the wagon, a pound of food each, and a payment of 25 gold per character (including Eren Marlowe).

##### Negotiation

The [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) can be talked down with three successful Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks (in any combination). It's DC 10 if the characters offer to pay the bandits something, but DC 15 if they try to convince the bandits to walk away empty-handed but alive. However, after three failed checks, the bandits are convinced the characters are full of hot air and won't entertain any further negotiations.

##### Combat

If it comes down to a fight, the [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) try to gang up on the most vulnerable target. Then, Bogdan threatens to finish off an [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) character unless his demands are met. Otherwise, the brigands disengage when wounded. They flee if one-third of their number are killed and none of the player characters are downed.

##### Developments

These [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) are only loosely associated with the Queen's Men and don't venture into Drakkenheim themselves. If captured or questioned, they don't know anything about the Queen's Men or Drakkenheim that isn't common knowledge. They have a hideout in an old barn a few miles off the road. If the characters follow up, the barn is guarded by six bandits. It contains their spoils: 75 gold in trade goods and coins and a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md).

> Sneaking and skulking is the preferred method, second best is having someone like me around.

#### A Night on the Road

A trio of harrowed adventurers approach the characters' campsite on the last night of their journey. They are tired, hungry, and hoping for a place to rest. They are leaving Drakkenheim after failing their quests and losing two of their other companions. They are bitter, defeated, cynical, and never plan to return, but share one or more rumours about the city as they sit and share stories by the fire. They are hesitant to talk about their fallen friends, but suggest watching out for the rats in Drakkenheim. They include:

- Ludwig von Graff, a penniless human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) who was trying to find the deed to his ancestral estate.  
- Endra Jansen, a human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) who was seeking fortune to pay off an old debt.  
- Rikard Vos, a human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) who survived the civil war and had returned to Drakkenheim searching for lost family members.  

Vos has accumulated five levels of **contamination** and is now [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). He follows his companions in a daze, and cannot speak as his tongue has rotted out from a **rasping mutation**. His friends have covered him in a heavy cloak to conceal his **wasting mutation** and the **tentacled limb** growing in place of his left arm.

If the characters detect Vos' mutations or pry the adventurers about his illnesses, they confess that he became sick after picking up one of the strange crystals in Drakkenheim. They insist the illness is not contagious, but rather caused by overexposure to the contaminated magic in Drakkenheim. They've heard expensive magical medicine might be able to help, but they can't afford it. Instead, they're hoping he'll get better once they bring him far away from the city.

Unfortunately, during the night, Rikard Vos succumbs to contamination and transforms into a [tentacled delerium dreg](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md). The monster flies into a rage and attacks one of its former companions. It's up to the characters to decide how to intervene. The creature is beyond reason and attacks unceasingly until killed. If von Graff and Jansen survive, they are deeply troubled by this incident. They solemnly warn the characters about the horrors of the city as they set off in the morning.

Marlowe has heard stories about contamination and delerium, but never witnessed it first hand. They note that handling delerium should be done with extreme care, and that far more terrible creatures are said to dwell in Drakkenheim, many the result of those who suffered a similar fate as Rikard Vos.

### Rumours

Rumours offer characters clues about Drakkenheim and prompts which encourage them to freely explore the ruins to see what they can find. A few rumours are true, some of them are somewhat misleading, and others are entirely false. Regardless, there is always value in looking into a rumour, as each will lead to great adventures! Here are a few suggestions for when characters might find a rumour:

- During downtime in Emberwood Village  
- Written on the walls of Eckerman Mill  
- Clues found in a random encounter  
- Interacting with rival adventurers  

You can choose one of the rumours or roll one randomly on the table below:

`dice: [](02-chapter-2-running-the-campaign.md#^rumour)`

| dice: d100 | Rumour |
|------------|--------|
| 1-4 | Don't go to Slaughterstone Square. |
| 5-8 | The Trolls of King's Gate will let you pass for a price, but it will cost you an arm and a leg. |
| 9-12 | Queen's Park Garden is filled with flowers unlike any you've ever seen, they glow with a strange colour to them and some people said they have immense healing properties. |
| 13-16 | Someone has been selling potions out of the old Reed Manor. |
| 17-20 | The Black Ivory Inn is up and running, and it sounds like business is booming too! |
| 21-24 | There is an invisible wall surrounding the old Rose Theatre. |
| 25-28 | The Queen's Men run vicious fighting pits beneath Buckledown Row, which lead to their secret stronghold in the sewers. The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) will grant any request within her power to whomever can survive a bout with her monstrous champion, but none so far have claimed the prize. |
| 29-32 | It's said the many [gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) perched atop the City Walls come to life and attack any who dare attempt to scale the walls. |
| 33-36 | The strange fishlike folk in the sewers are quite friendly, and have saved many desperate explorers. |
| 37-40 | The Followers of the Falling Fire have gathered at Saint Selina's Monastery. It's deep within the Haze, so how do they manage to survive there? |
| 41-44 | [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) was a mighty general during the civil war, leading the Hooded Lanterns isn't even the first time he's tried to retake Drakkenheim. |
| 45-48 | The Archmage of Drakkenheim died when the meteor fell, and the Amethyst Academy has yet to appoint a true successor. |
| 49-52 | The Knights of the Silver Order have camped outside the city, I hear they have weapons that can torch a village in moments. |
| 53-56 | The Noble Man, in his noble home. Withered, old, and all alone. His stare can chill you to the bone, a [pale man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md) on a pale throne. |
| 57-60 | I heard there are delerium crystals the size of a horse within the crater. Imagine how much they'd be worth! |
| 61-64 | Deep beneath Drakkenheim are the remains of an ancient dragon. An old legend claims they may be resurrected in a time of need. |
| 65-68 | The [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) has the power to grant the monarch's every wish. |
| 69-72 | A shrine to the Old Gods lies north of the castle, tended by an elfish druid with power over life and death. |
| 73-76 | A dwarven clan from the Glimmer Mountains has laid claim to a rich field of delerium south of the Crater. |
| 77-80 | Exploring the inner city is dangerous, and it's not just because of the monsters. Anywhere big chunks of the meteor landed are covered in the Deep Haze—the tower, the cathedral, the castle, or of course, the crater. It's a deathly fog that saps the body and clouds the mind... and that's only the beginning. What happens after—it's far worse. |
| 81-84 | [Queen Lenore](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lenore-von-kessel-dodk.md)'s favourite place to spend time was the grotto in the garden, where she housed many exotic flowers. |
| 85-88 | The inner city has become the hunting ground for a fearsome monstrosity known only as the [Lord of The Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md). All who dare enter become his prey. |
| 89-92 | A flock of [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) dwells in the Cosmological Clocktower. They viciously attack any who trespass on their territory, but they are deathly afraid of cats. |
| 93-96 | Whispers say the [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) serve a demonic god. |
| 97-00 | Many of the monsters lurking in Drakkenheim are in fact its former inhabitants, twisted by fell magic. They can be made docile by showing them a token of their former life. |
^rumour

## Conclusion

Marlowe has no intention of turning back, and insists the caravan press on towards Emberwood Village (described in chapter 4). In town, they will meet agents of the five factions, detailed in the next chapter.
