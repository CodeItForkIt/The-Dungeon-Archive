Beyond the incredible team who helped put this book together, the authors would like to express our deep gratitude for our viewers, subscribers, Patreon supporters, and Kickstarter backers. We would not be where we are today if it weren't for the encouragement and support you have shown for both us and *Dungeons of Drakkenheim*. Whether you joined us all the way back in 2018 when we streamed our first episode or are discovering Drakkenheim for the first time with this book - however you found us, we're so glad that you did and that we've been able to share this world with you. We truly thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

Furthermore, a huge thank you to Jill Danaitis & Joe O'Gorman - our very own Veo Sjena and Pluto Jackson! These two helped shape the world of Drakkenheim and the many many adventures within the ruins. *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* truly wouldn't be what it is without them. We'd also like to thank Kyle Drier: the unseen hand of Drakkenheim! Kyle has been instrumental in helping produce and edit our livestreams and podcasts. We are so grateful to have such positive, kind, giving and wonderful friends to collaborate with and see where the road to Drakkenheim leads.

Finally, we also want to thank our incredibly patient and loving partners - Kierston Drier and Shay Bytheway - who have put up with us through long hours spent writing and producing this project. They have been with us first hand through the thick and thin of our entire careers on YouTube, and we are so grateful for their love and support over the years.
