# Chapter 1: Introduction to Drakkenheim
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 4* 

**Drakkenheim is no more**. An eldritch storm of falling stars devastated the city on that woeful eve, leaving behind a meteorite that would have lasting effects. Fifteen years later, Drakkenheim is a dismal urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and haunted by hideous monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge, and powerful artifacts lie ready for the taking by adventurers brave or foolish enough to venture into the ruins. However, even those who survive the dangers of Drakkenheim may not return unmarked by its terrors!

## Campaign Overview

*Dungeons of Drakkenheim* is a fantastic adventure set in a gothic renaissance ruined city. The campaign is designed with four player characters in mind, so adjust accordingly for smaller or larger groups. You can play *Drakkenheim* as a series of loosely-connected exploration quests or an unpredictable narrative filled with faction conflict. The material herein will challenge characters from 1st to 13th level.

- **Exploration.** Characters embark on dangerous expeditions into monster-filled ruins, haunted streets, decrepit gardens, shattered mage towers, baroque cathedrals, and ancient castles to plunder treasure and solve mysteries.  
- **Interaction.** Five rival factions clash over the ruins of Drakkenheim. A tangled web of secrets, subterfuge, and sabotage awaits when the factions' opposing objectives and your characters' personal goals come into conflict!  
- **Combat.** Beyond fierce warriors dispatched by the factions, all manner of otherworldly horrors inhabit Drakkenheim. Characters battle undead husks, predatory beasts, mutated monstrosities, and terrifying abominations produced by the mysterious meteor.  

You'll need a copy of the core rules for Fifth Edition to properly run this adventure. When reading this book, text in **bold** usually references a creature or non-player character stat block, while text in *italics* often indicates spells or magic items. Many new monsters, items, and spells are described in the appendix sections of this book; otherwise, consult the Fifth Edition core rules.

### Delerium

Iridescent crystals of vast magical potential are found throughout Drakkenheim. Known as delerium, these lambent stones emanate unnatural energies that induce madness and monstrous transformations. Despite these dangers, delerium is ideally suited to crafting magic items and fuelling mighty new spells. Sorcerers, warlocks, wizards, and all manner of occult magicians crave its supernatural power, thus delerium commands a high price within arcane circles and underground markets alike. Many prospectors risk everything to collect a few fragments, but the true origins of the strange mineral remain unknown. The rival factions stand divided over whether the crystals should be destroyed, harnessed, or worshipped, and their simmering disagreements threaten outright war. Appendix D: Delerium, Magic & Spells covers the crystals in detail.

### Broken Realm

Drakkenheim was the cosmopolitan capital of Westemär, ruled by the imperious House von Kessel. A decade of bloody civil war erupted after the city's destruction. The realm was left shattered and the royal line broken. Now, the political order of the wider world lies in shambles, torn apart by religious schism and military conflict, and only a faint hope remains that the city can be rebuilt and the nation restored.

### Rival Factions

Five factions have arrived in Drakkenheim to advance their ambitious agendas. Though their ideologies and methods differ, each seeks valuable resources and lost secrets within the city. However, the ruins present many confounding obstacles for their agents. As such, all the factions hope to attract talented adventurers to their cause, drawing would-be heroes into a fierce political intrigue that may boil over into violent struggle. Those who wish to decide the fate of Drakkenheim must choose their allies well and their enemies carefully! Chapter 3: Factions contains complete details for running each faction, but they are summarized below:

#### Hooded Lanterns

Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the dour [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md), they wage a guerrilla war against the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in their nation's capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded Lanterns' efforts. These families believe once the city is restored, evidence will emerge revealing the true heir to the throne of Drakkenheim... or enable a cunning house to seize the crown.

#### Queen's Men

The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all of whom owe fealty to the enigmatic [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md). These reprobates prey upon the pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city. The Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, and conspires against the other factions at every turn.

#### Knights of the Silver Order

The Knights of the Silver Order are an organization of oath-bound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the dominant religion across the continent. They believe delerium is a contaminating blight borne of the darkest chaos, and have resolved to annihilate the corrupted crystals, slay every monster it has created, and hunt down diabolical mages who would wield its power to work evil magic. Now an entire regiment has been dispatched to Drakkenheim to carry out this righteous task, led by [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md).

#### Followers of the Falling Fire

The annihilation of Drakkenheim incited a serious religious schism within the Faith of the Sacred Flame. A new sect has emerged known as the Followers of the Falling Fire, who adhere to the prophecies of former Flamekeeper [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md). She attests that delerium is a divine gift, not a blight, and that these sacred stones will offer salvation against a greater darkness yet to come. The mainstream clergy have excommunicated Lucretia Mathias and branded her followers as an insane cult with heretical beliefs and blasphemous practices. Even still, masses of devout commonfolk now embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to Drakkenheim to take their place in a divine plan.

#### Amethyst Academy

The Amethyst Academy is a magical school for sorcerers and wizards, where students learn magic in remote castles and secluded universities. Directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful archmages, the Academy also operates an enterprising mage guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares, and orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides occult counsel to the nobility of the continent. However, the Academy was dealt a terrible blow following Drakkenheim's destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold: the Inscrutable Tower. [Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) leads the Academy's efforts to access the tower and safeguard the secret lore within. Meanwhile, their survey teams conduct ongoing research regarding delerium's supernatural qualities and unknown dangers. The mages plan to harness the crystals' vast energies to craft magical items and power new arcane spells.

### The Haze

There are more hazards in Drakkenheim than monsters and rival factions. A billowing mist filled with glinting multi-coloured motes has settled over the entire city, which adventurers call the **Haze**. It's like the dust never really settled after the meteor fell.

**Characters gain no benefit from taking a long rest within the Haze.** Adventurers should be well-rested before they head into the ruins, as they'll need to escape the city to regain their hit points and spell slots. This effect cannot be circumvented by any mundane equipment, nor bypassed with spells such as [rope trick](Mechanics/spells/rope-trick.md), [tiny hut](Mechanics/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md), or similar character abilities. These effects are described in detail in Chapter 5: Exploring Drakkenheim.

### Contamination

Characters will also encounter deadly **eldritch contamination** caused by creatures, delerium, and other magical phenomena in Drakkenheim. Abilities, equipment, and spells that protect against diseases, magic, or poisons do not work against contamination. It cannot be healed naturally, nor readily removed with low-level spells. Player characters will need to work with the factions and find creative solutions to manage these problems during their adventures. The full rules and debilitating effects of contamination are outlined in Appendix C: Contamination.

### Dangers of the Dark City

Finally, be warned that in Drakkenheim, characters will often stumble upon creatures and other perils far beyond what they can defeat on their own. Discretion and cunning may prevail when strength of arms fails. Adventurers must seek out like-minded allies, and be wary of making new enemies. They must have all the equipment they need before setting out on an expedition, use their resources carefully, and be prepared to retreat at a moment's notice!

## Content Warning

Drakkenheim portrays a dark fantasy world. We recommend players and Game Masters have an open conversation at the start of the campaign to discuss their lines and veils. In support of this conversation, please note references to the following are common in this adventure:

- Violence, murder, blood, gore, cannibalism, and body horror.  
- Degenerative mutations that cause physical disfigurement and madness/insanity.  
- Rats, spiders, insects, demons, undead, ghosts, and other monsters.  
- Natural disasters, large-scale loss of life, civil war, displaced persons, and refugees.  
- Moral ambiguity, social/political manipulation, religious zealotry and military nationalism.  

The campaign does not contain explicit sexuality, sexual assault, racial prejudice, systemic racism, homophobia, or transphobia. Any inferences to such are wholly unintentional.

## Character Creation

In a *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* campaign, the player characters are the heart of the story. Their choices, conflicts, and personal goals could decide the fate of Drakkenheim, if they survive! Below are guidelines for creating a player character ready to take on the dark city. We recommend players and Game Masters collaborate closely during character creation for the best possible results.

### Character Options and Backgrounds

Adventurers of any race or class in the Core Rules can be found in Drakkenheim.

- Appendix E: The World of Drakkenheim describes how many character ancestries, religions, martial arts, and magical traditions fit into the wider world.  
- Appendix F: Character Backgrounds includes new backgrounds players may use to closely connect their characters to the events, people, and mysteries in Drakkenheim.  

### Personal Quests

A character's core motivation for adventuring in Drakkenheim is represented by their personal quest. This is a specific individual objective for player characters to achieve during the campaign, but players need not reveal their personal quest to each other.

When a character completes their personal quest, they choose one of the following rewards:

- **Ability Score Improvement.** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.  
- **New Feat.** You gain a bonus feat of your choice, subject to the GM's approval.  

Player characters may select from the quests below, or work with the Game Master to design one:

#### Apocalyptic Vision

I have been haunted by visions of the meteor for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing down upon me. My personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there in order to stop these nightmares.

#### Arcane Secrets

Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim. Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these spells.

#### Blighted Landscape

A blight on the natural order envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen's Park Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater's Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.

#### Claim the Throne

Though my family has fallen on hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.

#### Faction Aspirant

I believe strongly in the ideals and goals of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knights of the Silver Order, or the Queen's Men. My personal quest is to join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their organization.

#### Family Matter

One of my family members or close friends has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they have foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively, they've been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring them back home.

#### Find a Cure

I have a friend, family member, or loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to reverse their horrific transformation.

#### Lost Heirloom

I used to live in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family. Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.

#### Monster Slayer

I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the decisive blow myself!

#### Overwhelming Debt

I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000 gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.

#### Personal Pilgrimage

As an acolyte of the faith, my personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina's Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine order.

#### Score to Settle

I have come to Drakkenheim to kill one of the faction leaders: either [Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md), [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md), [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md), [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md), or the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md). Perhaps I seek revenge for a past wrong. Alternatively, I may covet their position and wish to replace them. Either way, my personal quest is to slay them.

### Character Relationships

The campaign begins with the player characters setting out on their first foray into the ruins, but how did they meet? Consider establishing a personal connection between two or more player characters, such as one of the following:

**...siblings, cousins, or childhood friends**.

**...a shared origin, religion, or teacher**.

**...former rivals turned unlikely allies**.

**...one saved the life of the other**.

**...saw each other in a dream or vision**.

## Four Quick Facts about the World of Drakkenheim

Appendix E: The World of Drakkenheim explains these background details further, but the setting of Drakkenheim diverges from the default assumptions of Fifth Edition in four key ways:

- **The gods are silent and distant.** They don't manifest physically nor speak with worshippers, and do not interfere in earthly matters. Planar cosmology is mysterious and unknowable, but sages have still developed many conflicting (and wildly incorrect) theories.  
- **Divine spellcasting powers aren't granted by gods.** Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins tap into sacred energies through devotion, meditation, and resolve. Violating one's religious tenets won't result in a loss of this ability, but a crisis of faith might.  
- **Individuals can't become wizards through study alone.** The arcane magic of both sorcerers and wizards alike is borne in the blood, which may be harnessed via practice and study. The laws of the land bar arcane spellcasters from holding noble titles.  
- **High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally rare in the wider world.** Despite their few numbers, such people still have a profound impact on society. However, Drakkenheim has attracted an uncommonly high concentration of such individuals.  

## The Original Campaign

The adventure in this book is based on the *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* live stream campaign broadcast by the **Dungeon Dudes** which ran from October 2018 to December 2019. It featured Kelly McLaughlin as Sebastian Crowe, Jill Danaitis as Veo Sjena, Joe O'Gorman as Pluto Jackson, and Monty Martin as Game Master.

You can watch it on the Dungeon Dudes YouTube Channel (www.youtube.com/dungeondudes (https://www.youtube.com/dungeondudes)) and find it on most major podcast platforms. Check it out if you're looking for inspiration for how we ran the adventures in this book, but be warned: spoilers abound! We've also created a wealth of instruction videos for players and Game Masters covering everything about tabletop roleplaying games, from character building to designing campaigns.

Every major event, location, and non-player character is detailed in this book, and we've included many more completely new ones for you to explore in your own game. In many ways, the original campaign was a playtest for this book, and we've refined and updated several sections since. If you've watched the original series and notice an inconsistency between this book and the show (there are many), the version in this book takes precedence. On the flipside, you should feel empowered to alter, change, and expand the material here, especially if doing so builds stronger connections or better stories for you and your players.

The events of our original campaign are non-canonical with regards to this book, so several elements of Drakkenheim strongly connected to the original characters have been altered or removed. If you wish, the original "Drakkenforce" characters may appear in your campaign as rival adventurers, but their stories have been set aside herein so your players may take centre stage.
