# Appendix A: Monsters
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 196* 

Herein are described several new monsters that may be found in Drakkenheim. This appendix also includes many creatures based on monsters found in the "Core Rules" with additional traits and new descriptions to better suit this dark fantasy setting. However, any 5e-compatible monster could conceivably stalk the cursed streets of Drakkenheim as a twisted product of eldritch contamination, or magically conjured from distant netherworlds by the Haze. Use these modifications as inspiration to adapt your favourite monsters from other sources into twisted abominations in Drakkenheim.

## Mechanical Features

All non-humanoid creatures encountered in Drakkenheim possess the following traits. These do not change the monsters' challenge ratings.

- **Fully Contaminated.** This creature is immune to contamination, and has advantage on saving throws against contaminated spells.  
- **Haze Adaptation.** This creature may benefit from a long rest finished within the Haze. It can see twice as far through the Haze mists and Deep Haze fog.  
- **Haze Dependence.** This creature gains one level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) for every twenty four hours it spends outside the Haze. These exhaustion levels cannot be removed while the creature is outside the Haze.  
- **Delerium Healing.** As an action, a monster can touch a delerium shard to regain 10 (`3d6`) hit points. Once a monster has used a delerium shard in this way, the shard can't be used in this manner again for twenty four hours.  

These benefits do not apply to creatures originating outside the Haze or who are recruited or conjured by the characters, such as familiars and summoned monsters.

## Roleplaying Traits

All monsters inhabiting Drakkenheim are irrevocably gripped by otherworldly madness. Many become predatory and violent as a result, but a few are lucid. However, even these creatures possess an unstable consciousness that drifts between psychosis and psychopathy. They do not understand the origin of their malevolent predilections. All monsters have the following roleplaying traits:

- **Personality Trait.** I'm irritable or outright hostile around humanoid creatures. Logic and reason confuse and frustrate me.  
- **Ideals.** I feel a strange compulsion to contaminate or devour humanoid creatures.  
- **Bonds.** I'm obsessed with delerium crystals and wish to bask in their warm glow.  
- **Flaws.** I have one or more forms of indefinite madness, and often have trouble remembering what I was doing even a few moments ago.  

A creature's reaction to other monsters in the Haze depends on its own nature. It may be ambivalent, avoidant, hostile, or even servile.
