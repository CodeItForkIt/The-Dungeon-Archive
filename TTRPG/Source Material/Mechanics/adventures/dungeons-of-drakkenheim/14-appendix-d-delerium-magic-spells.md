## Delerium

Delerium is a magical mineral left behind by the meteor. It appears in geode clusters of translucent, sharp-edged crystals which reflect octarine light. The eldritch stones softly hum in dissonant tones, and glow brightly at night or when exposed to magic. Deposits are found throughout Drakkenheim, often fused into stone streets and buildings like crystalline moss.

A typical delerium fragment is about the size of a finger. Crystals may be fist-sized or slightly larger, and geodes may be as big as a pumpkin. Massive clusters might grow taller than a human.

| Size | Market Value | Weight | AC | HP | Extraction |
|------|--------------|--------|----|----|------------|
| Chip | 10 gold | 1/4 lbs | 15 | 5 | 1 action |
| Fragment | 100 gold | 1/2 lbs | 17 | 10 | 1 minute |
| Shard | 500 gold | 1 lbs | 19 | 15 | 5 minutes |
| Crystal | 1,000 gold | 2 lbs | 21 | 20 | 30 minutes |
| Geode | 5,000 gold | 20 lbs+ | 23 | 25 | 1 hour |
| Massive Cluster | Priceless | 8000 lbs+ | 25 | 50 | 7 days |

### Delerium Properties

All delerium samples have the following traits regardless of size:

- Immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.  
- Resistant to acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage; as well as slashing and piercing damage from magical weapons.  
- Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage from magical weapons.  
- Unless contained within an [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md), delerium shatters and crumbles into worthless ash when reduced to zero hit points. However, delerium geodes release a random **arcane anomaly** when destroyed (see below).  

#### Delerium Hazards

When a humanoid creature touches delerium without protective gear (such as gloves or tongs) for the first time on their turn, or ends their turn in bodily contact with delerium, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take `1d6` necrotic damage and gain one level of contamination (see Appendix C).

#### Delerium Harvesting

Delerium found in Drakkenheim is usually fused into the ground or stone buildings, and may be carefully extracted using handheld mining equipment such as shovels, picks, hammers, and chisels. Consult the table to determine how long it takes characters to harvest a shard. Lacking proper equipment, extraction takes ten times as long. Massive clusters are impossible to extract without heavy equipment or powerful magic.

### Uses for Delerium

Delerium has vast arcane potential. Beyond trade, crystals are used for several purposes:

#### Spell Component

Delerium may be used as an arcane focus or material component for any spell on the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. When casting a spell which requires a costly material component, a spellcaster may instead use delerium of equivalent value to the required cost.

#### Magic Items

Delerium is an exceptional material for creating magical items of all kinds. Several new magic items are described herein, but any existing magic item described in the Core Rules could be made with delerium. Fragments, shards, crystals, and geodes may be used to make uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary items respectively. At the GM's discretion, characters who can cast 5th level spells or higher may learn techniques to craft magic items of their own during their downtime.

#### Stable Delerium

The process for crafting magic items with delerium renders the crystals stable. Unless otherwise specified, characters do not take damage nor risk contamination when they touch or handle stable delerium. Stable delerium is damaged and destroyed in the same manner as a normal magic item of its kind.

#### Delerium Dust

Delerium dust is made by grinding the crystals against one another to create a fine powder. This milling process is extraordinarily hazardous unless performed within an [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md). Delerium dust can be used in alchemy, as a spell component, a reagent for brewing potions, or mixed into inks for [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md).

#### Improvised Weapons & Ammunition

Delerium fragments may be used as ammunition for a sling or fashioned into a makeshift club. Such weapons and ammunition deal an extra `1d6` necrotic damage, and non-contaminated creatures struck must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. Delerium used as ammunition in this way is destroyed.

**Arcane Anomalies**

`dice: [](14-appendix-d-delerium-magic-spells.md#^arcane-anomalies)`

| dice: 1d20 | Arcane Anomalies |
|------------|------------------|
| 1 | Gravity breaks within a 100-foot radius area for 1 hour. Creatures levitate in midair, and must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly. |
| 2 | The nearest creature is affected by a [hideous laughter](Mechanics/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md) spell (Save DC 15) but instead of laughing, the creature repeats unfathomable combinations of syllables and words. |
| 3 | Time skips a beat. Creatures within 60 feet experience a palpable feeling of vertigo followed by a powerful sensation of deja vu and are [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round (No save). |
| 4 | The nearest creature becomes unstuck in time. It is affected by the [blink](Mechanics/spells/blink.md) spell for 1 minute. Instead of vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, the creature vanishes into a sliver of time in its past or possible future. |
| 5 | A prismatic burst of energy erupts in a 20-foot radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `8d6` radiant damage and become [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round. The smell of ozone fills the area, and wood transforms into glass. |
| 6 | Echoes of possible realities are briefly visible for 1 minute. When a creature within 60 feet is hit by an attack, a faint vision of the creature being killed by that attack appears. |
| 7 | Discordant music fills the mind of all creatures within 30 feet, who are affected as if by [irresistible dance](Mechanics/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md) (Save DC 15). |
| 8 | A section of stone, water, air, or energy becomes an appropriate contaminated elemental. |
| 9 | An extraplanar creature is summoned and remains for 1 hour. The DM either chooses the creature or determines it randomly. It is friendly to the creature who triggered the anomaly. |
| 10 | All humanoid corpses within 120 feet animate as hostile [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md). The shrieking undead beg frantically for forgiveness as they rip apart the living. |
| 11 | The [shadows](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) of `1d6` random creatures in the area animate and try to kill them. Once destroyed, the creatures don't cast a shadow for 24 hours. |
| 12 | All creatures within 60 feet become [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 min or until they attack or cast a spell. |
| 13 | Tendrils of life flow from the nearest creature to others. It must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `8d8` necrotic damage, half on a success. The three nearest creatures within 60 feet each regain hit points equal to the damage taken. |
| 14 | A [hypnotic pattern](Mechanics/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md) (save DC 15) appears. It creates scintillating impossible colours in shapes which are simply wrong. Creatures [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) by the spell weep uncontrollably. |
| 15 | A [black tentacles](Mechanics/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md) spell appears in the area for 1 hour (Escape DC 15). |
| 16 | Objects within 60 feet come to life for the next hour, as if affected by the [animate objects](Mechanics/spells/animate-objects.md) spell. They mumble awful truths, but are not otherwise hostile. |
| 17 | The nearest creature is polymorphed into an [awakened shrub](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) for 1 hour or until reduced to 0 hp (No save). |
| 18 | Time slows down for up to six randomly determined creatures within 120 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the [slow](Mechanics/spells/slow.md) spell for 1 minute. (Save DC 15). |
| 19 | Time speeds up for one randomly determined creature within 60 feet of the anomaly. They are affected by the [haste](Mechanics/spells/haste.md) spell for 1 minute. |
| 20 | A bowl of flowers and a very surprised aquatic mammal appear 100 feet in the air. "Oh no, not again..." thinks the flowers. |

## Spells

This section contains new spells found in the Drakkenheim campaign. While many monsters and NPCs know these spells, **they are not available to player characters at the outset of the campaign**. Instead, characters must either study the spell from a found spellbook or scroll, locate a mentor to teach them the spell, or research the spells themselves!

### Learning the Spells

Once they've found a spellbook or teacher, a character must spend downtime and gold to master the spell before they may cast it. For each level of the spell, the character must spend two days of downtime and 100 gp practicing the spell. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.

### Researching New Spells

[Contamination immunity](Mechanics/spells/contamination-immunity-dodk.md), [contaminated power](Mechanics/spells/contaminated-power-dodk.md), [neutralizing field](Mechanics/spells/neutralizing-field-dodk.md), and [siphon contamination](Mechanics/spells/siphon-contamination-dodk.md) are totally undiscovered at the outset of the campaign, and must be researched by the player characters themselves. The spell descriptions outline the prerequisites needed to successfully research the spell. Once these requirements are met, a character must spend downtime and gold to complete the research: for each level of the spell, the character must spend 5 days of downtime and 250 gp. Once complete, the character may prepare the spell, add it to their spellbook, or replace a spell they already know with the new spell, as appropriate for the spellcasting features of their class.

### Secret Spells

In the world of Drakkenheim, several powerful spells found in the "Core Rules" are significantly rarer than normal: [astral projection](Mechanics/spells/astral-projection.md), [gate](Mechanics/spells/gate.md), [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md), [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md), [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md), and [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md). At the Game Master's option, player characters must obtain knowledge of these spells in the same manner as other spells presented in this book.

Non-player characters do not have access to these spells unless specifically indicated in their description or game statistics. Furthermore, the material components for these spells are exceptionally scarce and should be treated as consumable magic items of very rare (for 7th and 8th level spells) or legendary rarity (for 9th level spells).

### Contaminated Spells

Several spells include the "contaminated" descriptor beside their school of magic. Such spells always require delerium as a material component, and cause the caster to gain contamination when cast, as described in the spell description of each spell. The spellcaster can't prevent or ignore gaining this contamination level by any means, otherwise a contaminated spell simply fails.

## Seals of Drakkenheim

The Seals of Drakkenheim were jointly crafted by mages of the Amethyst Academy and the clergy of the Sacred Flame, and gifted to the royal family of Drakkenheim after the Edicts of Lumen. The six members of the royal council traditionally each carried one of these potent symbols of political authority, while the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) was worn by the monarch. While each faction seeks at least one of these magic items, the Hooded Lanterns and the Queen of Thieves wish to collect all of them so they can determine the political destiny of Drakkenheim.

### Crown Authority

A character cannot attune to more than one *Seal of Drakkenheim*. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as [wall gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) and [tower dragons](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.

As an action, you may present a *Seal of Drakkenheim* to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each [wall gargoyle](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) or [tower dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.

## Relics of Saint Vitruvio

These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.

A character attuned to three *Relics of Saint Vitruvio* may cast the [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md) spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both *Relics of Saint Vitruvio*.
