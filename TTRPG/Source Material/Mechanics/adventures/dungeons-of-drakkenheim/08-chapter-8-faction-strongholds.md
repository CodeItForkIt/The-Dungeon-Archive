# Chapter 8: Faction Strongholds
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 154* 

During their adventures in Drakkenheim, characters may explore these five mighty faction strongholds in a variety of ways. Early in the campaign, they may interact on friendly terms with faction members at these locations, but once characters reach 9th level or higher they might consider hostile missions into enemy faction strongholds.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/108-07-001.camp-dawn.webp#center)

## Interaction

Most commonly, player characters can visit a faction stronghold to meet with faction members and speak with the faction leader. Characters who are cooperatively working with a friendly faction may be invited to use the stronghold as a base of operations.

### Infiltration

Characters might also attempt sneaking into a faction stronghold for a specific purpose, such as rescuing a prisoner, sabotaging resources or defenses, spying on the faction, stealing an important item, or even assassinating the faction leader. Every faction expects this to happen and has taken reasonable and intelligent precautions that should provide exciting challenges for stealthy characters. Factions that acquire key items in the campaign, such as the *Relics of Saint Vitruvio* or the *Seals of Drakkenheim* store them in secure locations usually guarded personally by the faction leader, set up extra patrols, and may ask faction spellcasters to use protective spells such as [glyph of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) to keep the items safe.

### Assault

At some point in the campaign, the player characters may lead an invasion on an enemy stronghold in an all-out attack to drive an enemy faction out of Drakkenheim. The stakes should be appropriately high for such an exciting and decisive moment; a stronghold assault is a win-or-die play. You should give the players the opportunity to take the lead in coming up with a battle plan with their allies, and put the full resources (and tricks) of each faction front-and-centre.

However, given the troops involved, most factions simply cannot hide when they muster forces for an all-out attack on another faction stronghold unless specific and extensive action is taken to conceal it. This gives the besieged faction time to prepare its defenses and take adequate precautions, so you should increase the numbers of NPCs present, place faction strike teams in key locations, and secure the chamber of the faction leader and the main entrances to each stronghold.

During an all-out assault, it's best to have the player characters face down elite faction strike teams, spearhead an attack on the main gates, launch a commando raid to sabotage an important defense, or have a dramatic showdown with a faction lieutenant or the faction leader, while their faction allies engage the rank-and-file to hold off reinforcements. The focus of any faction stronghold assault should be on heroic action, not a cumbersome mass combat scenario (unless your players *really* enjoy such scenarios).

### Adventure

The Inscrutable Tower and the Court of Thieves are two notable exceptions: both behave more like a typical adventure site and are presented accordingly for exploration.

## Camp Dawn

A few miles southwest of Drakkenheim is a recently constructed fortified encampment. Just outside the furthest edge of the Haze, here the Knights of the Silver Order have established their base of operations for their sacred mission in Drakkenheim. [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) has set up his command post, and runs the camp with strong military discipline grounded in fiery faith.

### Interactions

Camp Dawn can accommodate five hundred soldiers, support staff, and stockpiled supplies, as well as stabling hundreds of draft animals, [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md), and flying mounts. Not everyone here is a warrior, however: many are labourers, cooks, and clergy that assist the fighting force and run the day-to-day tasks around camp. Nevertheless, dozens of Silver Order strike teams are resting, training, or resupplying here at any one time, in addition to the posted guards in the areas described below, representing two-thirds of the Silver Order's total forces in Drakkenheim.

The encampment operates under the same military standard one would expect from a front-line fortress on the eve of battle against a dangerous and duplicitous foe. The knights maintain a detailed roster of their personnel and equipment, with many checks and balances in place to follow up on missing patrols or misplaced gear.

#### Visiting the Camp

Any visitors approaching the gates are required to state their business. Those granted entry must disarm, and are escorted by a Silver Order [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) or several [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) wherever they go within the camp. The Silver Order is hospitable to those who are wounded or need help, but always treats any guests with caution. Allies of the Silver Order are recognized by the gate guards and may freely move about the camp, and may even be offered their own tent. Those who wish to speak with the Knight-Captain are escorted to the Command Post.

#### Defences

The encampment is in a perpetual state of readiness, and the rank-and-file respond to any attack, intrusion, or infiltration by quickly banding together and raising a general alarm. Every single guard on duty carries a horn, and specific calls are used to alert the camp upon the discovery of a fire, sabotage, slain guards, intruders, attackers, or all clear. These can be heard throughout the camp, and `1d4` [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) rush to the site in short order, with many more to follow.

### Area Details

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Camp Dawn has a tall wooden palisade wall surrounded with a ditch filled with water and sharpened stakes. At each corner is anchored a defended guard tower. Entry into the camp is by four gatesâ€”one at each cardinal direction. Each gate is flanked by towers, with a wooden bridge leading over the ditch to the wooden doors. Inside, the camp is an array of activities. Most of the enclosure is filled with neatly organized rows of large canvas tents, grouped around small cooking fires and supply carts.
^4c8

- The main walls of the camp are constructed by double-layered wooden logs. Each log is twelve to fourteen feet long and ends in a spike. Stone and gravel have been piled along the base of the wall for reinforcement.  
- A ditch fifteen feet deep and ten feet wide has been dug around the entire perimeter like a moat. The trench is filled with sharpened wooden spikes and knee deep water. There is a sturdy wooden bridge over the trench leading to the camp gates.  
- Along the interior of the walls is a rampart made of wooden scaffolding. `1d4` [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) patrol between each tower, each carrying heavy crossbows.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/110-map-7.01-camp-dawn-player.webp#gallery)

#### [1] Supply Wagons

There is a constant flow of wagons entering and leaving the camp. More arrive each day to keep the encampment freshly stocked with food, water, weapons, equipment, and other necessities. The ministry of the Sacred Flame funds the Knights of the Silver Order, so little gold or currency travels directly through the camp.

- Wagons are usually protected by a [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) or `2d4` [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), and driven by a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md).  

#### [2] Guard Towers

Two towers flank each entrance into the camp, and one reinforces each corner. The square structures are built from thick wooden logs with ladders ascending from the ground. The defended platform rises about thirty feet off the ground with wooden stanchions and a pointed wooden rooftop.

- Each tower has 2 [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and `2d4` [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) equipped with horns and crossbows.  

#### [3] Rookery Towers

A round wood and brick tower sits in the southwest of the camp. Large arched windows circle around its exterior, and a wooden platform perches out from each. Ropes and ladders provide access to the tower. This tower has several nests for the griffon mounts of the Silver Order.

- Two dozen adult [griffons](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) are found here at any given time.  
- A [cavalier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) and `1d4` [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) stand guard.  

#### [4] Stables

A long wooden building has been constructed along one of the walls of the fort. Two barn doors on each end open to a central aisle with rows of fenced stalls on each side, each filled with hay and a water trough.

- About 40 [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) are housed here at any given time.  
- A staff of a dozen stablehands (human [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) tends the horses, and 2 [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and `2d4` [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) patrol nearby.  

#### [5] Infirmary

A long short square wooden building in the northwest of the camp acts as a hospice for injured knights. The building has a warm fire inside and many cots and tables. `2d6` [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) and a [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) are taking care of the injured. At any given time, `1d6` [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) are resting here recovering from contamination and other injuries.

- A small stockpile of 10 (`3d6`) [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) are kept here, along with `1d4` scrolls of [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [prayer of healing](Mechanics/spells/prayer-of-healing.md), [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md), [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) each.  

#### [6] Pyre of the Sacred Flame

A large pyre burns ever brightly at the heart of Camp Dawn. This consecrated bonfire is lit by a [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) and emits a [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) spell effect. The flame is surrounded by several wooden benches and prayer mats. This is not a place for meals or cooking. It is a place of worship; a shrine constructed in the field so the faithful knights may contemplate their duty to the Sacred Flame.

- Each morning, [High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) leads prayers and hymns around the pyre, a ceremony that usually lasts about an hour. Everyone not on duty attends these gatherings. [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) is often in attendance.  
- During the rest of the day, another [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) and `2d4` [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) tend the pyre, and often others in the camp will stop here to make their own personal prayers.  

#### [7] Knight's Tents

The northern half of the camp comprises eighty tents in neatly organized rows. Each tent has four bunks for sleeping staff or soldiers. Each keeps their belongings in satchels or small footlockers within. Most are occupied during the night, but empty during the day. Each cluster of tents keeps their own stoves or cooking fires.

Amongst all the tents, there are all manner of martial weapons, ammunition, suits of medium armour, and shields. Each tent typically sleeps one [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and the [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) of their retinue.

#### [8] Flamekeeper's Tents

These larger tents are set up next to the infirmary. Each is decorated with silver trim and is equipped with one to four cots, a small stove, a desk with a chair, and a chest for belongings.

- These tents are used by the clergy of the Sacred Flame who reside in the camp: [chaplains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) and [priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md), and [High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md).  
- `1d4` [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) are posted as guards for the Flamekeepers at all times.  

#### [9] Command Post

The command post is a large open tent that sits just off the pyre. Inside is a large meeting table that can sit most officers in the regiment, with a map of Drakkenheim unrolled upon it. Several wooden figures are set on the map showing plans and tactics for military operations.

![Pyre Priest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/111-07-002.pyre-priest.webp#center)

- 4 [cavaliers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) stand guard at the command post at all times, but typically the tent is abuzz with activity. [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) is usually here during the day, conferring with several [chaplains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md), [priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md), [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md), Silver Order strike teams, or [Ophelia Reed](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md).  

##### Knight-Captain's Tent

This large tent in the southeast of the camp is decorated with lavish designs and silver filigree. The symbol of the Sacred Flame hangs on a banner next to the entrance. Inside are animal fur rugs, a large wardrobe, a locked chest, a simple bed, and a seldom-used writing desk.

- This is the private tent of [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md). 2 [cavaliers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) are assigned to guard the Knight-Captain at all times.  

#### Stockpile

About five hundred feet from the main camp is a wooden shed that has been constructed in a clear field. Inside the shed are several barrels and crates filled with [alchemist's fire](Mechanics/items/alchemists-fire-flask.md) and oil. The shed is reinforced and locked, and clearly visible from the guard towers.

- The shed is manned by `1d4` [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and `2d6` [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) patrol nearby at all times.

## Court of Thieves

Hidden deep under the city lies the stronghold of the Queen's Men, the Court of Thieves. Occasionally referred to as the Undertavern, it is the personal lair of the Queen of Thieves. While it could be near Buckledown Row, the placement of the Court of Thieves is up to you.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/112-07-003.court-of-thieves.webp#center)

### Interactions

Finding the Court of Thieves is a challenge all its own. Its location is a closely-kept secret only known to a small number of Queen's Men agents on a need-to-know basis: even Blackjack Mel himself doesn't *really* know where it's found.

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe  
> 
> I used to know my way around, but the streets have changed. Is that even possible?

#### Visiting the Court of Thieves

Named members of elite Queen's Men strike teams travel here occasionally. As such, following, interrogating, or tricking the Queen of Thieves' own strike teams is the best method for locating the court. Important prisoners and treasures seized by the Queen's Men agents eventually make their way back here. The player characters might be able to engineer an opportunity to lure out a strike team to track back to the court by using tantalizing bait.

Regardless, those who come to parley with the Queen of Thieves are presented with a fiendish puzzle before they are granted an audience (see the "Queen's Riddle" below).

##### Queen's Champions

A widely-circulating rumour claims that the Queen of Thieves grants a personal favour to any who defeat the arena champion, and so characters who made a name for themselves fighting in the rings of Buckledown Row might be invited to the Court of Thieves to test their mettle in the arena instead.

#### Defences

The Court of Thieves focuses on security through obscurity. A Queen's Men strike team is usually on guard here. Devilish traps protect the inner sanctum of the Queen of Thieves.

### Area Details

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 7.02: The Under Tavern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/113-map-7.02-theives-throne-room.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/114-map-7.02-theives-throne-room-player.webp#gallery)

#### Aquifer Junction

This circular aqueduct passage is inhabited by three [giant crocodiles](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md). They've been lured here deliberately to ward off snoops or intruders. They don't answer to any of the Queen's Men, but any of the faction members who regularly come here know to give them a wide berth.

The walkway along the sewer canal here is heavily damaged and has partially collapsed into the waterway. Huge blocks of stone and gravel are piled up, but the wall itself is completely intact.

- A DC 15 [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) check determines the walkway isn't collapsed: it's an intersection heading east blocked off with wreckage.  
- The wall here is an illusion created by a permanent [major image](Mechanics/spells/major-image.md) spell cast by the Queen of Thieves. Creatures and objects simply pass through to a wooden staircase in the Undertavern.  
- Excavation equipment or magic would be needed to remove the wreckage.  

#### Undertavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wide sewer passage has been transformed into a makeshift tavern. The main canal is drained, relatively dry, and blocked with debris in several places. Wooden planks hammered and lashed across the canal form bridges and decks above, accessible through ladder-like stairways. The broad upper sewer walkways have been cleared out to make room for about a dozen round tables with stools set around each. Hanging lanterns are strung up throughout to light the chamber, and a few coal stoves provide meager warmth. An impressive bar has been constructed, lined with barstools from which a curiously dapper mechanical barman serves ale and mead. At the far end of the tavern is a small band of ruffians performing lively music upon an improvised stage. Several rogues and thieves mingle about.
^4dc

- The canal continues east to another intersection, which heads north into a fog-shrouded tunnel and further east to a collapsed tunnel.  
- One or two Queen's Men strike teams are watchfully relaxing here most of the time. They aren't hostile to visitors, even enemies of the Queen of Thieves. Instead, they invite characters to share a drink with them and chat. Characters who inquire about seeing the Queen of Thieves are told to speak with the Barman.  
- The Barman is a mechanical creature with the game statistics of a medium-sized [shield guardian](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md). He can serve and mix drinks with aplomb. He doesn't speak, but any mention of the Queen of Thieves prompts him to deliver a programmed response via the [magic mouth](Mechanics/spells/magic-mouth.md) spell (see the "Queen's Riddle" below).  

##### Kitchen

Several wooden panels have been set up here to create a separate kitchen. Inside are several well-stocked pantries, and a pig roasts over a fire pit. Anyone is free to use the kitchen, there's no designated cook.

##### Secret Doors

Seams in the walls are noticeable by a creature within five feet who makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Knocking on the wall causes the door to slide open, revealing spiral staircases to the Arena Level or the Prison.

#### Poisoned Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The canal exits the tavern into a ten-foot-wide arched tunnel shrouded by a menacing green vapour.
^4e0

- The mist is magical, but whether or not it is harmless is impossible to determine (see below). If dispersed by wind, it reappears one round later.  
- NPCs in the bar explain that beyond lies the audience chamber of the Queen of Thieves. They claim the mist contains a powerful toxin that will render anyone who isn't inoculated against it completely [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and unresponsive.  
- Those who wish to see the Queen uninvited must solve the Queen's Riddle given by the Barman first. Any who solve the riddle will become inoculated against the toxic mist, and may pass through safely.  
- Queen's Men agents and strike teams in the bar have been "inoculated" already as they've proven their loyalty to the Queen of Thieves.  
- What the NPCs don't know is that the mist is actually harmless, and the potion they drank was merely a placebo. However, since this is what they *believe to be true*, they aren't lying. They do not know the answer to the riddle or how the riddle works.  

#### The Queen's Riddle

Recite the following carefully:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The barman gestures to the mist-filled passageway and speaks:
> 
> "The Queen of Thieves bids any who seek an audience drink to her true name."
^4e2

He then sets the following drinks upon the table before you:

- A bottle of red wine....  
- a cask of yellow mead...  
- a jug of white milk...  
- a pot of black coffee...  
- and several empty drinking cups.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Then the barman speaks again:
^4e3

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "It's a drink more pure than water, and more deadly than poison. When you finish your drink, it fills your cup, but you'll die if it's all you have to drink."
^4e4

#### Solution

The entire riddle is a misdirection:

- The liquids are non-magical, but each contains an undetectable reactive toxin.  
- A creature who drinks any of the liquids then walks into the mist activates the toxin.  
- The toxin causes the creature to fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 8 hours or until they take damage, with no saving throw.  
- [Unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) characters are stripped and locked in the prison cells below.  

The answer to the riddle is "nothing", but speaking the answer prompts no response from the Barman. If someone drinks, he gestures towards the mist. The correct solution is to simply ignore all the drinks, and walk through the mist. It's not even necessary to drink from the empty cups.

#### Thieves' Throne Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This sewer junction has been blocked off, drained, and cleaned to create a throne room. Most pillars are repurposed pipes and a large sewer grate rests in a depression in the centre of the room. The brick walls still bear the stains and discolourations of sewer water, though the scent of perfume fills the air. Fine tapestries and benches with well-worn but choice scavenged pillows are positioned along the walls, and hanging braziers illuminate the room. At the far side of the chamber is a large circular alcove illuminated by lanterns, upon which is an impressive stone throne. A throng of chattering and laughing guests lounge about the room, including all manner of ne'er do wells, dashing rogues, and sly charmers.
^4e7

##### Courtiers

Most people in this chamber aren't real, and are instead the result of many carefully designed [programmed illusion](Mechanics/spells/programmed-illusion.md) spells. This illusory model audience is perfectly programmed to play along with the Queen of Thieves' charades: cavorting like affable flunkies, gasping dramatically, uproariously laughing, sneering, barking cruel insults, clapping enthusiastically, and otherwise performing as needed.

- A Queen's Men strike team is positioned here whenever the Queen of Thieves holds an actual audience.  

##### Throne

The Queen of Thieves is seldom here in person, and instead appears here via the [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) power of her resplendent desk in the office (Area X).

##### Trap Grate

This iron grate is an obvious trap. A button on the armrest of the throne and a hidden lever on one of the pillar pipes cause it to snap open suddenly. Any creature standing on it is deposited into the Arena Floor, where they land in a pool of deep water and suffer `4d6` damage from the fall.

##### Secret Doors

A depression in the wall here is noticeable with a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. Knocking on the wall causes the door to slide open to the guest rooms.

##### Guest Rooms

Offered to "guests" of the Queen of Thieves, these well-appointed bedchambers are in fact sufficiently insulated from the Haze thanks to their underground position. Depending on the nature of her company, the Queen of Thieves may place poisoned drinks and food here, or seal the doors with [arcane locks](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and [glyphs of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md).

#### Rogue's Gallery

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This circular room may have once been a cistern. Upon the walls are now dozens of immaculate paintings and artworks. Several passages lead from this room to other exits. One has a metallic door covered in stunningly complex mechanisms and locks. Beside it is a wooden wine cabinet. The other is rather nondescript.
^4ee

- **Treasure.** There are forty three paintings in this room. Seven are recognizable as authentic masterpieces by some of the greatest artists who ever lived and are worth 2,500 gp each, the rest are worth 250 gp each. Garnering the full value for each painting would require hosting an auction to attract a host of wealthy collectors, however.  
- **Wine Cabinet.** One of the alcoves of this room contains a wooden cabinet that holds twelve wine glasses and twenty two bottles of fine wine. Half contain real wine; two bottles are actually [potions of gaseous form](Mechanics/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md) disguised using [arcanist's magic aura](Mechanics/spells/nystuls-magic-aura.md) to appear nonmagical. The rest are poisoned. A creature who drinks from one must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only the Queen of Thieves knows which is which.  
- **Shackled Door.** At the bottom of a short stair is an impressive door covered in a massive array of mechanical gears, locks, keyholes, buttons, latches, and handles. Each is frustratingly complex and may be disarmed or picked with a DC 20 Dexterity (thieves' tools) check, which either reveals yet another compartment with even more locks or resets a previously opened lock. There's no real logic to the system, it's a useless distraction as the door leads nowhere. However, one of the keyholes is actually a thin tube that leads to the office, but only a creature physically small enough to enter the keyhole could detect it.  

#### Queen's Gauntlet

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Before you is a perfectly clean, featureless stone passage.
^4f0

- This long hallway snakes around before ending in an [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) door (DC 30 to open).  
- This devilish trap was devised by the Queen of Thieves to defend her personal sanctum; the entire hall is lined with a dynamic mechanical and magical system. Roll initiative when characters move down this hallway. Each round on initiative count 20 and 10 (losing initiative ties) the Queen's Gauntlet activates one of the following defences, which spring out from anywhere along the walls, floor, or ceiling:  

##### Multiattack

The gauntlet makes two **whirling blade** or **poisoned darts** attacks, each against different targets within range.

- **Whirling Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 14 (`4d6`) slashing damage.  
- **Poisoned Darts.** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit*: 4 (`1d8`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.  

##### Battering Ram (Recharge 5-6)

A section of the wall springs open. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (`3d10 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be flung 20 feet away from the battering ram and knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone).

##### Snare (Recharge 5-6)

A spinning bolas launches from a panel on the wall to ensnare one creature within 10 feet of any wall. The target must succeed on a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by sticky barbed wire. A [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 17 Dexterity or Strength check.

##### Flame Jet (Recharge 5-6)

A bronze nozzle pops from the wall shooting gouts of flame in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Pit Trap (5/day)

A ten-foot by ten-foot trapdoor in the floor snaps open anywhere in the hallway more than five feet from another open trap door, leading to a fifty-foot-deep pit. Creatures standing on the floor in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit. On a successful save the creature leaps clear on the side of the pit (it can choose which). The bottom of the pit is different each time this ability activates:

- **Featureless.** There's nothing at the bottom of this pit.  
- **Acid Pool.** The bottom of the pit is filled with a five-foot-deep pool of acid. A creature who starts its turn in the acid takes 10 (`3d6`) acid damage.  
- **Spikes.** The pit is lined with sharp spikes. A creature falling into the pit takes an additional `5d6` piercing damage.  
- **Contaminated Water.** The bottom of the pit is filled with contaminated water ten feet deep. A creature that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of Contamination.  
- **Liquid Hot Magma.** Ten feet at the bottom of the pit is filled with lava. A creature who enters the pit or who starts its turn there takes `10d10` fire damage.  

##### Portcullis (5/day)

A heavy iron gate slams down from the ceiling above. Creatures below can make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to leap clear on either side. A creature who fails this saving throw lands [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). Those who fail the save by 5 or more are instead crushed under the portcullis. The creature suffers `5d6` bludgeoning and `5d6` piercing damage, and becomes [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) under the portcullis until freed. A creature can lift the portcullis by using an action to make a successful DC 17 Strength check. It may also be attacked and damaged; it has AC 20, 30 hit points, and is immune to psychic and poison damage.

##### Nerve Gas (2/day)

The hallway releases a deadly neurotoxin. Each creature in the hall must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magical gas. On a failed save, the target takes 14 (`4d6`) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. In addition, it can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for one minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Countermeasures

Characters can use whatever means at their disposal to defend themselves, or simply take the [Dash](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dash) or [Dodge](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) actions and hope for the best, or try the following:

##### Perception

On its turn, a creature can spend an action to examine the area around it for signs of traps with a successful DC 17 [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) check. On a successful check, either the next saving throw it makes against the trap automatically succeeds, or the next attack roll made against it by the trap automatically misses.

##### Disarm

A creature can attempt to disable one of the gauntlet's systems. It chooses which action it wants to disarm and makes a DC 22 Dexterity (thieves' tools) check. On a successful check, the mechanism is disabled for one minute. On a failed check, the creature accidentally triggers the mechanism.

#### The Office

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the door is a tidy and luxurious office paneled with wood and bookshelves. Three bronze candelabras illuminate the chamber with soft ember light. A mahogany desk sits in the middle of the room with a sumptuous upholstered chair behind and two fine wooden chairs before it. Atop are several neatly stacked papers and journals, a lamp, and a box of fine fountain pens. Several large framed mirrors hang on the wall opposite the desk and to the left and right side of the room. A model globe rests in one corner, and in the other is a petrified wingback chair fixed to the floor.
^4fc

A mental [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md) spell notifies the Queen of Thieves whenever someone enters this chamber.

##### Bookshelves

Gothic novels, play scripts, and other fiction involving dastardly criminals, tricksters, and other villains are found here. Written in the margins of each text are commentaries left by a genre-savvy reader about the many mistakes made by the villain in the story. Occasionally, particularly clever reversals made by the heroes are circled in red ink.

##### Mirrors

These magical mirrors are positioned such that anyone seated at the desk may see behind themselves and observe others in the room from every angle. In addition, the reflections of [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects are visible in the mirrors, which also reveal the true nature of any illusions or shapechangers. Hidden behind one of the mirrors is the end of a thin tube that connects to the Shackled Door in the Rogue's Gallery.

##### Resplendent Desk

Kept in the desk drawers are comprehensive dossiers on each of the player characters, faction leaders, and lieutenants. Not only do these notes detail virtually everything about their capabilities and exploits thus far, within may be secrets unknown even to the player characters themselves. The desk and chair are magical; a creature sitting at the desk on the chair can use an action to cast [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) to a range of 300 feet.

##### Petrified Wingback

A creature who sits on this stone chair is immediately teleported as if by [dimension door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) to an identical-looking chamber (see below). In that moment, the teleported creature sees an illusion of any other creatures in the room being disintegrated, while those creatures see an illusion of the teleported creature having its flesh painfully seared away, leaving behind nothing but a blackened skeleton that crumbles into ash if touched. Looking at the skeleton through the mirrors in the room reveals it to be an illusion.

##### Globe

This inaccurate but meticulously detailed globe opens at the equator, revealing a liquor cabinet with seventeen bottles of fine spirits and eight tumblers. Only four contain real alcohol; two bottles are actually [potions of gaseous form](Mechanics/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md) disguised using [arcanist's magic aura](Mechanics/spells/nystuls-magic-aura.md) to appear nonmagical. The rest are poisoned. A creature who drinks from one must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only the Queen of Thieves knows which is which.

#### Secret Sanctum

These chambers are deep under the earth, and almost entirely inaccessible except via teleportation. They are outside the Haze, and creatures can rest here normally.

This secret room is completely identical to the office in every way, and sitting on the wingback again returns a creature to the original office. However, the doorway exits to a short hall with two impressively secure iron doors. Each door is [arcane locked](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and warded with a [symbol](Mechanics/spells/symbol.md) spell. The rooms beyond are both protected by [private sanctum](Mechanics/spells/mordenkainens-private-sanctum.md):

##### Bedchamber

A [mirage arcane](Mechanics/spells/mirage-arcane.md) spell has decorated this room to appear like the penthouse apartment in Castle Drakken with a magnificent view of the city as it was twenty years ago. The only real objects in the room are a comfortable bed, a table upon which the Queen of Thieves keeps her spellbook, and a [decanter of endless water](Mechanics/items/decanter-of-endless-water.md). If you wish, a trinket that provides a revealing clue about her true identity is found here, and the [mirage arcane](Mechanics/spells/mirage-arcane.md) can be adjusted to better reflect the real person behind the Queen of Thieves. Hidden beneath a loose tile under the bed is a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md) she uses to escape if she ever becomes trapped here.

##### Queen's Vault

This vault contains 10,000 gp worth of bullion, coins, and gems, neatly stacked, a [helm of brilliance](Mechanics/items/helm-of-brilliance.md), and one other rare magic item of your choice. If the Queen of Thieves has acquired any Seals of Drakkenheim, Relics of Saint Vitruvio, or other important items, they are kept here (unless she is using them herself).

#### Arena

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This natural cavernous chamber is roughly fifty feet high and supported by stone pillars. Perhaps it was a water reservoir, drained by the blockages created by the Queen's Men. Only a small pool of water remains here now, sloshing against a narrow sewer pipe.
^506

When word gets out a fight is going down, the Queen's Men rush from the Undertavern down here using the secret staircase to watch the fight.

##### Drainpipe

Just above the waterline of the pool is a two-foot-wide drainpipe that used to siphon from the reservoir. The pipe travels one hundred feet and exits to the wider sewer system.

##### Bleachers

This narrow walkway forty feet above the arena floor sports a rickety wooden railing and dozens of benches.

##### Queen's Balcony

This overhanging section of the bleachers is reserved for the Queen of Thieves to watch the fights. A special throne is reserved for her, but she usually appears here using a [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) spell.

##### Fighter Chamber

Gladiators invited to fight in the arena get ready here. Weapon racks hold at least one of each martial weapon, several shields, and a few breastplates and helmets.

##### Big Linda's Den

This bone-strewn chamber is where [Big Linda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/big-linda-dodk.md) (see below) sleeps most of the time.

#### Gladiators

Should the characters find themselves volunteering to fight in the arena, a rival adventuring party or an evenly-matched Queen's Men strike team make for suitable foes. The no-holds barred contest merely stipulates that combatants who are knocked [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) or surrender are pulled from the field. If the characters defeat their opponents, the Queen of Thieves invites them to face her champion, [Big Linda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/big-linda-dodk.md).

#### Big Linda

> [!quote] A quote from The Queen Of Thieves  
> 
> Big Linda has proven well worth the lives I spent to capture her. She is the prize champion of my fighting pit, and a loyal friend. I am very much excited for you to meet her. Also, before you ask, yes she bites

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/115-07-004.big-linda.webp#center)

[Big Linda](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/big-linda-dodk.md) resembles a dragon without wings, and has knobbly flesh accented by shimmering scales that stretch along its back. The monstrous beast has a gaping maw of razor-sharp teeth and a tail of razor-sharp spines, but dishevelled and useless forearms. Big Linda uses the game statistics of a [tyrannosaurus rex](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/tyrannosaurus-rex.md) with the following additional traits that increase its challenge rating to 9. Big Linda has been permanently [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the Queen of Thieves and (usually) obeys her spoken commands. The creature emerges from its den in response to the Queen's whistle call.

- Immunity to acid damage and [blindsight](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Blindsight) 30 feet.  
- ***Acid Spew (Recharge 5â€“6*).** Big Linda spews acid in a 30 foot cone. Each creature in that line of fire must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (`11d8`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

#### The Queen's Request

Characters who do defeat Big Linda in an arena battle may ask a single favour of the Queen of Thieves. Much like a capricious genie, she will grant the request, but will twist it to her advantage.

#### Prison Block

![Thief](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/116-07-005.thief.webp#center)

If any player characters or faction agents are kidnapped by the Queen's Men, they are stripped to their skivvies and brought here. The Queen of Thieves takes any important or choice items belonging to captives and stores them in her vault, and the minions who made the capture get their pick of the rest. As such, there's no convenient place where captured characters can recover lost equipment, as it's quickly dispersed amongst the ranks of the Queen's Men. When they release prisoners, the Queen's Men don't return stolen equipment.

##### Guard Room

This dingy chamber has a rickety wooden card table and containers with manacles and chains. A bugbear [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) named Mulg is chief jailer and is stationed here with a detail of four [scoundrels](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md).

##### Interrogation Rooms

These dingy chambers have a swinging lamp overhead and a single chair. Ropes, chains, pliers, and torture implements are kept within each. Any screams resound from within and travel unsettlingly down the halls. A [doppelganger](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) named Thought-stealer carries out interrogations for the Queen of Thieves.

##### Cells

These wretched cells stink of sweat and waste. They are locked (DC 20 to open). Keys are kept by Mulg, Thought-stealer, and the Queen of Thieves. Rolf Wagner, a rank-and-file member of the Hooded Lanterns, is kept here. He was captured months ago and the Queen of Thieves has been using his identity to spy on the Hooded Lanterns.

## Drakkenheim Garrison

Not far from Shepherd's Gate lies the Drakkenheim Garrison. This building was the former stronghold of the city guard, and so made a perfect base of operations for the Hooded Lanterns. The Garrison takes up an entire city block; fortified stone walls extend from a squat round keep and enclose several barracks, stables, workshops, and storehouses. Deep beneath the garrison is a well-secured stockade prison.

The Hooded Lanterns secured a major victory just last year when they drove out the monsters occupying the garrison. When the greencloaks discovered that the prison cells were sufficiently shielded and insulated from the Haze, Lord Commander Elias Drexel ordered it repurposed into living quarters then began relocating his forces here. Since then, the regiment has expended considerable resources repairing the defences. It has been a gruelling, dangerous, and time-consuming operation, but now the renewed fortress is the perfect strongpoint for launching future incursions deep into the city.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/117-07-006.garrison.webp#center)

### Interactions

The Drakkenheim Garrison is a well-fortified base and meant to withstand infiltration, attacks, and sabotage. It is by far one of the most secure locations in the city besides Castle Drakken itself. Fully stocked, it could house and feed hundreds of defenders for weeks. However, since the Haze forces the occupants to rest in the underground prison and rapidly contaminates food and water stores, only about 300 soldiers occupy the base at any one time. Moreover, the force must still be constantly rotated to ensure troops stay fresh and well-rested, as field conditions are not unlike a castle under siege. Not everyone stationed here is a warrior, however, and a few especially brave cooks, smiths, and other personnel have come to aid the efforts of the Hooded Lanterns here.

#### Visiting the Garrison

While the Hooded Lanterns are open to new recruits, they regard those who approach their holdings within the city with suspicion, expecting either scavengers looking for help and handouts or worse, saboteurs looking to infiltrate their base. Nevertheless, they are willing to help injured and contaminated adventurers evacuate the city, and those seeking either permission to pass through Shepherd's Gate or an audience with [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) are invited to enter the garrison and escorted by a detail of `1d4` [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) to the Commander's Keep.

#### Defences

The Garrison is perpetually in a state of readiness, and able to respond to any alarm for attack, intrusions, or infiltration. The [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) and [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) on guard duty are each equipped with signal flares that may be loaded with various smoke colours to call for help or retreat, warn about monsters, flag intruders, and give the all clear. In addition, the Garrison Towers are each equipped with bellowing alarm bells that can be heard throughout the city. When rung, resting Hooded Lanterns spring into action and patrols are recalled from the streets to defend the garrison.

> A small fortress looms over the streets, its towers jutting out above the impenetrable walls and thick iron portcullis. Several circular bastion towers topped with ballistas reinforce the walls. One can make out from a distance several green-cloaked figures with crossbows manning the walls and towers.
^518

#### Walls

The masonry walls of the Garrison are thirty feet high and five feet thick. A wooden scaffold lines the inside of the walls with ladders and stairs ascending from the inner courtyard.

- Each segment of the wall is patrolled by `1d6` [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) at all times.  

#### Towers

These fifty-foot-tall towers are ten to twenty feet in diameter. Atop is a crenellated battlement accessible via a wooden hatch and fixed with a ballista. The towers are accessed from inside the garrison by a short wooden staircase, and within each tower are four wooden floors connected by sturdy ladders. Arrowslits, windows, and stockpiles of ammunition are on each level, but the topmost floor has an arched window facing the courtyard set with a large bell that sounds in case of an attack. An [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) and `2d4` [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are posted to each tower.

#### Gates

Two gates lead into the garrison; the south is flanked by bastion towers and the other is set into the north wall. Each is an archway fixed with ironbound and reinforced double doors that may be fastened closed with a bolted brace. Two [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) stand guard on the ground outside each gate.

#### Training Yard

This courtyard rests within the walls and has been fashioned with a fenced off area that comprises the majority of it. The ground here is muddy and worn. The far end of the courtyard is lined with sandbags and targets for archery, and a few scarecrow dummies set up for weapons training. Along the left side of the yard a small wooden platform has been erected where [Ansom](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) or [Petra](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) usually oversee training.

- During the day `4d6` [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), and `2d4` [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) are training here.  

##### Stables

Off to the side of the training yard is a small stable that is no longer in use for housing horses. Instead, this building has been repurposed into cells to keep prisoners short term if the need arises.

##### Well

This well draws from the city aqueducts, and so the water is contaminated. As a result, the Hooded Lanterns have blocked it off with rubble and boarded over the opening.

##### Storehouse

A small storehouse is constructed along the southern wall of the yard. This small wooden shed is primarily used to store raw materials such as iron, wood, and various tools that may be used for general purposes around the yard. Due to the impact of the Haze, this storehouse can no longer be used for storing cured meats, water, or any other items that could spoil due to the contamination.

> [!quote] A quote from Pluto Jackson  
> 
> Survivors fueled by hope. A familiar feeling of battle readiness hangs in the air.

#### Armoury Tower

This four storey tower rests at the southwest corner of the garrison. The ground floor houses a small table with four chairs and a deck of cards where guards often take breaks. The levels above are equipped with stockpiles of weapons, armour, shields, ammunition, and materials that are ready for use.

- 4 [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) and twelve [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) occupy this tower at any time.  
- **Smithy**. At the base of the armoury tower is a small open workstation and blacksmith forge where gear and ammunition is manufactured or maintained.  
- 2 [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) can be found here at any time working on repairs and maintenance on gear.  
- Modrin Engers, a human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) devoted to the old god of craftsmen works the smithy. He also helps out in the infirmary with healing, as he knows the [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) spell.  

#### Barracks

Three large buildings inside the garrison make up the barracks. The ground floor of each wooden building consists of a mess hall, kitchen, infirmary, and a storeroom. The second level of each is a long room for bunk beds and footlockers. However, the Haze renders the bunks unusable for rest and recuperation. One of the buildings has been entirely boarded up and the furniture moved into the stockade. The other has been similarly emptied of furniture, and repurposed to store construction materials, spare parts for siege equipment, and barricades in case repairsor extra fortifications are needed.

##### Mess Hall

The north barracks building still operates as a common hall for the troops, and is often filled with off-duty staff and rangers taking their meals.

During the day, the barracks area contains `5d6` [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), `2d6` [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md), and `3d6` [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) working in the kitchen, relaxing, or enjoying meals in the hall.

#### Lord Commander's Keep

The largest structure in the garrison is a squat four storey stone keep, sixty feet tall and forty feet wide. It features a broad battlement level upon which a catapult has been constructed. [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) keeps his personal quarters and coordinates the operations of the Hooded Lanterns here. A set of broad steps lead up to the fortified entrance doors, and each floor is connected by a square staircase on the southern edge of the tower.

- 6 [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) and 12 [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) form the security detail for the keep, with two posted outside the front entrance at all times, and about half manning the battlements.  

##### Reception Hall

This stern entrance hallway is supported by several stone pillars and features a large hearth. The walls bear tapestries depicting the coats-of-arms of previous Lord Commanders.

##### War room

Taking up the second level of the keep is a meeting room with a large round table at the centre. A high wooden chair is set before the coat of arms of Drakkenheim, and many smaller chairs are placed around the table. A highly detailed and complete map of Drakkenheim is spread out on the table before a panoply of scout's reports, mission briefs, dossiers, and supply lists.

- During the day, [Eliss Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) holds important discussions and devises plans and operations for his goals in Drakkenheim. The busy man is almost always meeting with a Hooded Lanterns strike team, or [Petra](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) and [Ansom Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md).  

##### Offices

There are a few small rooms on this floor with desks equipped with inks and papers, as well as a common area lined with bookshelves, documents, maps, and other miscellaneous works and writings. Much of the bureaucratic work of the city guard was carried out here, such as soldiers' pay and schedules, but now such formalities are largely dispensed with so the room is rather disused.

##### Commander's Quarters

The top level of the tower is a regal bed chamber with large windows, a writing desk, wardrobe, and a thick fur rug. The quarters appear untouched and have gone unused for some time. Elias Drexel hasn't bothered to use these quarters since he returned to Drakkenheim, and keeps a bunk in the stockade with his troops rather than use this Haze-filled chamber.

> [!quote] A quote from Veo Sjena  
> 
> The Hooded Lanterns saved my bacon when the city fell, I would have been toast living on the streets of Drakkenheim alone! These loyal survivors strive to keep unprepared adventurers from the dangers beyond the walls, if only to make sure they can survive to pay their due.

#### Stockade

The stairs down from the keep stop at a small office, then descend further into the dungeons.

Beneath the garrison is a small office and a large dungeon lined with cells. This entire area has been repurposed into the new barracks of the Hooded Lanterns, housing their entire force for rest and recuperation.

##### Jailer's Office

At the bottom of the stairs is a small office with an iron gated door on the far side leading to the cell blocks. A small desk and chair are set next to it. An [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) can be found on duty here at all times

##### Cell Blocks

Each cell block consists of long hallways with a dozen individual cells on each side accessed via a sturdy iron door with a barred window. Originally, the cells were used for one or two prisoners, but now bunks have been installed within each to sleep four soldiers. Footlockers under each bunk hold the soldiers' personal belongings. Only the Lord Commander has a private cell.

##### Infirmary

Instead of being used as bunks, several cells in this block were repurposed into a spartan infirmary equipped with [healers kits](Mechanics/items/healers-kit.md) and medical supplies. Furthermore, a few of the cells here are still used for this original purpose if the need arises to house prisoners for longer than a day.

- Cal Grice, a human [druid](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) serves the Hooded Lanterns as a medic. They know the [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) spell.  
- The Hooded Lanterns keep a stockpile of 10 (`3d6`) [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) and `1d4` jars of [restorative ointment](Mechanics/items/keoghtoms-ointment.md) here.  

## Inscrutable Tower

Alongside the distant Paradox Castle and the Enigma Ziggurat, the Inscrutable Tower is one of three widely known strongholds of the Amethyst Academy. Though there are five more hidden throughout the world, this is unquestionably the greatest of them all. The loss of the tower was a nearly crippling blow for the otherwise mighty and resourceful Academy, though the Directorate has taken great pains to conceal this uncomfortable fact.

This enigmatic structure was a mystery even before a meteor struck it. None can say exactly when it appeared in Drakkenheim, but most think that it must have been some time after the Edicts of Lumen. Yet there is no record of its construction, which seems incongruent given the massive tower would have taken decades to build.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/120-07-007.meteor-impact.webp#center)

In truth, the Inscrutable Tower is the ancient and legendary hidden fortress of the Sorcerer Kings. This extraplanar dungeon was built within the roiling realm of chaotic possibility known as the Space Between Worlds in far antiquity by powerful and insane sorcerers to hide away their magical knowledge, but was left forgotten and abandoned for a thousand years. When the mages of the Amethyst Academy located it several hundred years ago, they tapped into the immense power of its Arcane Nexus to shift the whole structure into the mortal world, where it now stands in Drakkenheim. Since then, the Amethyst Academy gradually expunged most records and memories of this accomplishment to rehabilitate the tower's evil and ominous history. Yet there are many secrets about this place unknown to even the Amethyst Academy, including whatever magical forces now hold the tower together even after a meteor smashed through it.

### Overview

Unlike the other faction strongholds described herein, the Inscrutable Tower is not occupied by its controlling faction. Instead, the Amethyst Academy aims to regain control of it. Though it will take them months, if not years, to refurbish and repair the tower once this is done, it could cement the Academy's controlling influence over Drakkenheim.

#### Adventure Hooks

##### Seize the Tower

Securing control of the Inscrutable Tower is a make-or-break mission for the Amethyst Academy, but also its enemies. If the Academy is able to regain control over the tower and begin repairs, it will allow them to enact more ambitious actions to seize control of Drakkenheim. On the other hand, the Amethyst Academy can be organizationally paralyzed if another faction occupies the tower and takes the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md).

### Interactions

#### Interloper

Several malfeasant mages are found throughout Drakkenheim: [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md), the [Pale Man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md), and [Ryan Greymere](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md). If any of them have survived to this point in the campaign, choose one of them to make their own incursion into the Inscrutable Tower to seize it for themselves (you might want to have Oscar Yoren "level up" to an [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)). They gather up some appropriate minions of their own: [wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wight.md), [haze hulks](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md), or summoned **elementals** (respectively) and are encountered at the breach in the library, plumbing the arcane knowledge within. The malfeasant has managed to claim the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) for themselves, and are searching for an alternate means to control the Nexus as they cannot do so alone.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/121-07-008.academy-tower.webp#center)

Alternatively, if the players have made an enemy of the Amethyst Academy, [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) sends his [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md) here instead under similar circumstances. If his simulacrum was already destroyed, he arrives in person with an [iron golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) and an Amethyst Academy strike team.

Finally, if neither seems like a viable option, an [efreeti](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) has managed to escape the Deep Cells and conjured several [fire elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md) and [azers](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) to serve it. The creature hasn't fully escaped the binding magic holding it to the Inscrutable Tower, and is looking through the books for another means of escape.

### Area Details

Three-quarters of the Inscrutable Tower is composed of a massive library (detailed below) that spans most levels. The remaining floors in this unfathomably large structure have a sprawling maze-like layout with roughly a dozen rooms connected by a twisting set of corridors. There is no consistency in the floorplan from floor to floor, and the configuration of the rooms is often illogical and may even defy the spatial geometry. Dormitories might be beside highly dangerous laboratories, or storage rooms for ingredients used by a workshop kept several floors apart. You can construct layouts as you see fit by using the various rooms described in the Residence Floors and Research Floors. The Lobby, Great Hall, Library, Director's Office, Nexus, and Deep Cells are singular specific locations in the tower, however.

#### Exotic Materials

The walls, halls, and furnishings found in the Inscrutable Tower are made from obsidian, dark steel, granite, black marble, and glass.

#### Magical Amenities

Magic provides lush comforts throughout the Inscrutable Tower. Fireplace hearths don't have chimneys, instead using special [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells that radiate pleasant but otherwise harmless heat. Most rooms are illuminated with persistent [dancing lights](Mechanics/spells/dancing-lights.md). Bound [unseen servants](Mechanics/spells/unseen-servant.md) tend the halls, keeping rooms tidy. Magical fonts produce water via the [create water](Mechanics/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md) spell. A creature can focus their attention (as an action) on a light source, heat source, or water source they can see to cause it to turn on or off, or adjust its brightness or intensity. The parameters are such that these can't become so hot or cold to harm a creature, or so bright as to blind them. However, each time these are manipulated, roll ``. On a 1, a random arcane anomaly is triggered due to the erratic magic that grips the tower.

#### Magical Wards

Powerful magic protects the Inscrutable Tower. The exterior walls and doors are magically reinforced and are immune to all damage (except meteors). The doors and walls extend into the ethereal plane, blocking ethereal travel through them, and magic can't alter their forms. Creatures outside the tower can't teleport inside, nor can they teleport within the tower rooms unless they have a direct line of sight to their destination.

#### Tower Exterior

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy is an immensely tall structure that reaches a dizzying height of twelve hundred feet. The shimmering obsidian walls are perfectly smooth; there is not a single window or embellishment along its outer face save a deep vertical groove cut into the pinnacle. Seen at a distance the tower appears relatively narrow, though it is roughly one hundred fifty feet wide and anchored by sharply arched buttresses at the base. The tower has been smashed apart roughly two-thirds up its height. Remarkably, the top of the tower hovers above in utter defiance of gravity. Between the upper and lower sections is a gaping breach with pieces of floating debris locked in the air; frozen in time at the moment a meteor soared through it. A keen-eyed observer can see fragments of delerium, broken bookshelves, and scattered tomes bobbing about the wreckage.
^53a

#### Academy Plaza

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cobblestone streets break here, a campus park surrounding the Inscrutable Tower. A forest of delerium crystals have grown up around the tower that surrounds a small artificial lake. Overlooking the pond is a large stone plinth surrounded by arcane arches.
^53c

The area around the Inscrutable Tower is covered by the Deep Haze.

- Etched into the stone is a great [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md).  
- The remains of a pair of [stone golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) who once guarded this site.  
- `1d4` [protean abominations](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md) and `2d4` [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) inhabit the plaza.  

#### Tower Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A broad staircase of seventeen steps bordered by a sloping ramp leads up to the singular entrance of the Inscrutable Tower. The dark steel doors are engraved with the sigil of the Amethyst Academy: a lidless arcane eye set within an octagram. There are no handles or hinges upon the door.
^53e

- A character attuned to a set of *academy rings* who places their hands upon the door causes a set of glowing arcane runes to appear. After a short set of arcane clicks and whirring noises, there is a flash of light and the doors slide open with a screech.  
- Since *academy rings* are made for a specific individual, if the player characters don't possess a set of their own, they will need either an ally or a living prisoner wearing them to gain entry into the Inscrutable Tower. Characters can also enter via the breach itself, assuming they can fly or climb there.  

#### Lobby

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The front doors lead into a massive lobby that fills the tower base. The ceiling is nearly fifty feet high and supported by obsidian pillars etched with intricate sigils, and the floor is reflective marble decorated with intricate arcane patterns. Rows of tall, thin vents along the outer walls form transparent openings allowing a view of Drakkenheim outside. On two opposite sides of the lobby are three sets of metallic double doors, and railingless spiral staircases of metal and glass wrap upward around the pillars on each corner.
> 
> Throughout the rest of the room are chest-high stone dividing walls that form semi-private meeting areas set with metallic chairs and glass-topped tables. Bobbling motes of spectral lights drift through the air, illuminating the chamber with soft arcane light.
^540

- Four erratic [shield guardians](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md) linger in this chamber and attack any who enter. Two hold spells: one [wall of fire](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-fire.md), the other [ice storm](Mechanics/spells/ice-storm.md), and both are as if cast by a [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md).  

#### Elevators

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four of the six sets of metal double doors are closed, one has slid partially ajar. The last is erratically slamming shut and jolting open at random. Looking beyond is a ten-foot-wide shaft that bristles and hums with arcane energy. Once in a while there is a thunderous crack of lightning that resounds up and down the shaft.
^542

- The shafts extend up the length of the tower, but are broken by the breach. Four of these elevators still function, however, and can provide access to the lower portion of the tower.  
- Once every `1d6` rounds a [lightning bolt](Mechanics/spells/lightning-bolt.md) (DC 16) shoots up the length of the two broken shafts.  
- The closed doors magically open when any creature approaches within ten feet of them, and a prismatic platform of magical energy forms within the shaft, above which float glimmering arcane runes arranged vertically: from bottom to top, the runes read "Lobby", "Great Hall", "Residences", "Research Levels", "Library", and "Director's Office".  
- A creature may step onto the platform and speak where it wishes to go, and the platform ascends with stomach-churning speed to that level.  
- There are multiple runes for the residences, research levels, and library indicating the dozens of levels for each, thus the speaker must specify individual floors. The levels past "63" don't function, so travel via the elevators to the upper portions of the library, the director's office, or the nexus isn't possible.  

#### Great Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This resplendent dining hall prominently features an elevated platform where a long marble-topped dinner table with high chairs faces the room. Before it are three long rows of polished granite-topped tables with dark steel chairs. Spectral chandeliers and candles of magical energy hover above, illuminating the room. Along the walls are tall portraits of archmages and professors of the Amethyst Academy.
^544

- The portraits are magical, and the figures within come to life and [counterspell](Mechanics/spells/counterspell.md) anyone who casts a spell in this room.  
- The sleek dinnerware are all magically animated, and trundle into their place at the dinner tables with food from the kitchen, then whisk away to the scullery to clean themselves.  
- The large kitchen is immaculately clean and organized, featuring well-made iron ovens, stoves, steel-topped food preparation tables, and organized glass cabinets for the dinnerware and utensils. The cookware is similarly animated, preparing food and tending the kitchen on its own.  
- The well-stocked larder opens into a vast featureless extradimensional space containing prodigious food stores upon neatly organized metal shelves, all magically preserved. The kitchen cookware daintily retrieves ingredients as needed.  

#### Residence Floors

Throughout the Inscrutable Tower are numerous apartments and quarters for the mages:

##### Apprentices' Dormitory

These rooms contain four single bunks set with personal chests and nightstands. There is a shelf over each bed for personal journals with an iron lantern hanging from it. Clusters of these rooms are often found around a small common room with a tiled hearth, glass-topped table, and shelved books on mundane topics.

##### Wizard's Apartments

These well-appointed apartments are sealed with [arcane lock](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) spells. Most often, entry is keyed to the original (long dead) occupant only. Each consists of several rooms:

- A common room to hold meetings and take meals.  
- A workroom, summoning chamber, mediation room, or scrying pool.  
- A small study and private library to conduct personal research.  
- A private bedroom and water closet.  

A permanent [unseen servant](Mechanics/spells/unseen-servant.md) tends each apartment, keeping it clean and tidy. Left behind in some apartments are [spellbooks](Mechanics/items/spellbook.md) containing 10 (`3d6`) wizard spells of 5th level or lower, plus `1d4` uncommon [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) or potions.

#### Research Floor

Other floors of the Inscrutable Tower are dedicated to the study of magic and the manufacture of magical items:

##### Alchemy Labs

These chambers reek of chemicals, and contain cauldrons for creating potions or brewing alchemical concoctions. Cupboards and shelves contain material components for transmutation spells.

##### Arcane Workshops

These rooms are used to craft magic items.

- **Golem Workshop.** Making golems. Partially complete golem.  
- **Scriptorium.** Scribing scrolls.  
- **Surgeon's Chamber.** Not common, but there is one such room in this tower to provide biological and necromantic research.  
- **Spellforge.** A pedestal before a "firing range." "Target dummies."  
- **Elemental Forge.** Fabrication Chamber.  

##### Chamber of Illusions

These square rooms have scalar lines in a one-foot grid along the ceilings and walls. The otherwise entirely featureless void is the perfect place to practice illusion magic.

##### Copy Room

These rooms each contain `1d6` bound [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) chained to writing desks. These miserable creatures are tasked with making copies of any book or writing given to them.

##### Materials Storage

Secure chambers sealed with [arcane lock](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md) spells. Spell components, inks, herbs, gemstones and other rare arcane ingredients, mundane materials such as stones, metals, leather, wood, cloth, parchment, and paper.

- **Morgue.** Bodies used for biological and necromantic research.  
- **Menagerie.** Contains animals.  

##### Seminar Rooms

Used for classes.

- A handful of larger lecture halls are twice the size, suitable for groups of forty to fifty. Larger gatherings are held in the Assembly Hall, however.  

##### Summoning Chamber

Specially prepared with materials needed for summoning and binding extraplanar creatures. Some have [magic circles](Mechanics/spells/magic-circle.md) and [dimensional shackles](Mechanics/items/dimensional-shackles.md).

- One of the summoning chambers contains a woman sitting in the middle of a magic circle. The circle is lined with salt. She begs players to break the salt barrier so she can leave. She argues that evil mages trapped her here and she has been stuck for years. She will plead with the players and offer them aid, information, wealth, or anything they want to hear. If the seal is broken she instantly transforms into a [bone devil](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/bone-devil.md), and attempts to kill the party and flee.  

##### Scrying Pools

These private and secure round meditation chambers contain a mirror, pool of water, or other font needed for divination spells.

#### Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Library of the Inscrutable Tower is a vast and dizzying place. Staircases zig-zag from wall to wall, weaving up the height of the tower between walkways of black marble with railings of dark steel and massive floating bookshelves of speckled granite and glass lined up like airborne dominoes. The stairs and shelves rumble lowly as they shift positions to converge at suspended balconies and galleries where obsidian-topped tables, plush couches, and amber spheres of glowing light are arranged into reading nooks and studying desks. Throughout, many stairs and platforms are nauseatingly oriented sideways, some even completely upside-down and backwards.
> 
> Every conceivable surface stores books. The balconies, furniture, walls, and even the steps of each stair all have cavities, niches, and shelves containing tomes of varying shapes, sizes, materials, and colours, some in neat and tightly organized rows, others in disheveled piles and scattered masses of pages.
^552

- The library comprises an ever-changing and dynamic layout. It is one hundred fifty feet wide on each side.  
- The elevators stop at the ground level of the library and rise no higher. Before the damage was done, secret doors behind bookshelves along the walls opened for easier access, but these are broken now.  

##### Stairs

Most staircases are thirty to fifty foot long sections, each five feet wide. The stairs connect and disconnect to each other and the platforms by some unfathomable pattern. For any given stair section, roll `` each round, and on a 1, it moves.

##### Platforms

The various platforms have a variety of equilateral shapes - square, triangular, hexagonal - and range from ten to thirty feet in diameter. The ground level of the library is arranged into reading nooks and study desks like the other platforms.

##### Gravity

Gravity is subjective here. Characters can walk normally on staircases and platforms, even sideways or upside-down. Creatures levitate in midair instead of falling, but those lacking a flying speed must move by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a railing or bookcase), which allows them to move as if they were climbing. Unattended objects float around randomly.

##### Soaring Intellect

A creature can fly and hover within the library with a speed equal to ten times its Intelligence modifier.

##### Tomes

Herein are books on every conceivable topic, from artworks, history, natural philosophy, magical matters, mathematics, and more. Among the books are introductory and advanced texts, exhaustive commentaries on those texts, poignant commentaries on those commentaries, scathing refutations of that commentary, a rebuttal to refutations of the commentaries, treatises that purportedly reinvent the topics altogether, and many works of complete fiction and utter fantasy.

##### Spellbooks

The library contains multiple tomes detailing every spell from the sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list in the "Core Rules" (and many more beyond) with the notable exceptions of [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md), [demiplane](Mechanics/spells/demiplane.md), [clone](Mechanics/spells/clone.md), [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md), [gate](Mechanics/spells/gate.md), [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md), and the new spells described in Appendix D.

#### Shattered Breach

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Looking above from the library, characters can see the breach in the tower. Visible are the remains of that section of the library, where the stairs, shelves, and platforms still shift and move, but in a field of wrecked debris. A crackingly storm of eldritch lightning erupts between the gently floating debris, cast adrift gently in space, defying gravity.
^55a

- The breach is a one-hundred-fifty-foot-wide gap in the library. Traversing the breach requires flight, but there are several stray shelves, platforms, and stairs creatures can rest upon.  
- Chunks of delerium and meteoric iron hover about the air, interacting with the magic within.  
- Gravity remains broken in the breach, and creatures may still fly via *soaring intellect*.  
- A creature who ends its turn in the breach rolls `1d6`. On a 1, it's struck by eldritch lightning. It must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `10d6` lighting damage, or half as much on a successful save.  
- Casting a spell in the breach automatically triggers an arcane anomaly.

> 
> I've been to a couple Academy strongholds, none of them felt welcoming, this one feels less so.

#### Director's Office

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Behind an impressive set of double doors is the director's audience chamber. Opposite the entrance to this circular room is a sumptuous obsidian throne flanked by iron candelabras. The sigil of the Amethyst Academy decorates the wall overhead, and the marble floor depicts a complex planar astrolabe. Overhead, a chandelier of steel and copper rings gently rotates, showing the movement of the celestial spheres. On either side of the throne is an arched iron door.
^55c

- This room is located on one of the topmost floors of the tower, just below the Nexus.  
- The archmages of the Amethyst Academy keep personal chambers within the Inscrutable Tower merely as a formality: all maintain private [demiplanes](Mechanics/spells/demiplane.md) as their primary abodes. Instead, this room serves as a meeting place to conduct business with others.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The left door opens outside the tower itself. As the door opens, a glimmering balcony of magical force takes shape that rings the entire tower with a narrow walkway five feet wide. There is a heaving lurch, as panels in the outer wall swing open below. A great telescope of glass and bronze emerges from within, supported by a metallic crane that moves it into position over the balcony. A chair is built into the side of the telescope, upon which are several intricate switches and levers.
^55d

- Controls on the telescope allow it to be moved and rotated around the tower.  
- Several runes on the telescope play back a record of past observations. The last rune indicates a record was made the day the meteor struck, indicating that the archmage only became aware of the meteor in the final moments before it struck.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The right door opens into a smaller circular chamber where a round granite slab hovers three feet off the ground. Splayed out over it are all manner of missives, magical implements, and occult instruments. Glass shelves holding arcane components and books line the walls.
^55e

- ***Treasure*.** This is a tuning fork keyed to the mortal plane, the material focus for a [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) spell. Scrolls of [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md) and [forcecage](Mechanics/spells/forcecage.md), and a very rare magic item can be found here.  
- A sealed chest in this chamber contains the components needed to repair the clocktower, including an ancient (pre-meteor) delerium crystal in a preserved glass sphere.  

#### Nexus

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gigantic and incomprehensible arcane apparatus whirs, clicks, and hums upon an obsidian plinth at the centre of this chamber. Revolving rings of brass, rotating golden plates embossed with diagrams of magical formula, whirling crystal lenses, spinning bronze rings etched with markings bearing out the movement of the planes, receptacles bearing lambent glass orbs of various colours and sizes, and delicate brass instruments orbit around a pulsing sphere of collecting energy. It glows with a strange prismatic light as it erratically convulses and emits spasmodic arcs of arcane plasma that send shudders and shakes through the room.
> 
> Surrounding the machine are eight massive cushioned chairs held aloft by articulated bronze arms. Levers, buttons, switches, and plates that glow with magical runes are built into the armrests, and an array of telescoping apertures and lenses are affixed to the headrests with jointed metal rods. Seated within each is a warped and barely recognizable lifeless body.
> 
> The ceiling is a massive dome made from interlocking glass panes in organic shapes, each which gazes upon a different alien sky. Booming lightning crackles above. The rest of the room is ringed with shelves holding jars of spell components and eldritch curiosities.
^560

- This is the topmost level of the Inscrutable Tower.  
- The nexus contains a dimensional rift that has become unstable due to the damage caused by the meteor. The nexus must be rebooted to stabilize the dimensional rift.  
- Rebooting the nexus requires each of the eight chairs be disengaged and shut down. A creature seated in the chair can use an action to manipulate the apparatus. Doing so takes an action and DC 20 [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana), [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation), or [Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) check. Checks can also be made with tinker's tools or thieves' tools.  
- On a failed check, the creature suffers `4d6` psychic damage from backlash. Failure by 5 or more causes the creature to become [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) for 1 round.  
- Each attempt immediately triggers an arcane anomaly.  
- After the first chair is reset, on the following round on initiative count 20, `1d6` random extraplanar creatures are conjured by the erratic interference of the machine being partially on and partially off.  
- Once all eight chairs are successfully disengaged and shut down, the nexus powers down and the dimensional rift becomes stable.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/124-07-011.academy-tower-cut-out.webp#center)

#### Deep Cells

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this forty-foot-wide obsidian chamber contains only a twenty-foot-wide cylindrical shaft lined with rows of hexagonal cells arrayed in a honeycomb.
^562

- This is the bottom chamber of the Inscrutable Tower, but space warps around itself, and it can only be accessed from a stairway opposite the Director's Office that seems to impossibly lead back down the entire tower.  
- The cylindrical shaft descends one thousand feet into the earth before ending in an immobile [sphere of annihilation](Mechanics/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md). All in all, there are over eighty thousand cells here.  
- Two [stone golems](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) stationed here as guards have gone berserk, and attack any who enter the chamber.  
- A [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) once covered the opening of the shaft, but the magic has failed. Fortunately, most of the other defensive features of the cells remain intact:  

##### Cells

Each cell is a hexagonal cavity about ten feet wide and ten feet deep. An [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md) fills each, and either a [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) or a [prismatic wall](Mechanics/spells/prismatic-wall.md) covers the opening. An arcane rune identifying the contents of the cell hovers in the air before the wall. A destroyed wall reforms one round later.

##### Keys

The magical wards upon each cell are individually keyed to a specific person, a password, and a token, and are manipulated by providing two of the keys and then speaking a command word within ten feet of the corresponding cell. The command words and their effects are as follows:

- **Secure.** Raises the [wall](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) and activates the [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md).  
- **Release.** Lowers the *wall*.  
- **Disengage.** Deactivates the *antimagic field*.  
- **Discharge.** Lowers the *wall* and deactivates the *antimagic field*, then causes a blast of force to violently expel the contents of the cell into the shaft, where they fall into the [sphere of annihilation](Mechanics/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md) below.  

Each token is a magical trinket and could be almost any kind of object, but each always bears an invisible arcane rune that identifies the corresponding cell. Thousands of such objects are scattered about the Inscrutable Tower.

The exact contents of the cells are best left to the imagination, but they could contain all manner of extraplanar entities, fiends, and magical artefacts. Given the variety of creatures and objects stored within, it isn't uncommon for unique specimens to have specific safeguards.

> [!note] Developments
> 
> **The Tower Reclaimed.** While it will be some time before the tower can be repaired and brought to a fully operational state again, accomplishing this major objective allows the Academy to move on to the next stage of their plans for Drakkenheim.
> 
> - The Amethyst Academy will permit a player character who is a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard that can cast spells of 6th level or higher and opts to formally join the Amethyst Academy to carry the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) on a mission to Castle Drakken that requires it.  
> - The Amethyst Academy offers three very rare magic items in exchange for the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) to groups who wish to keep it. If this offer is refused, they may attempt to steal it back.  
> 
> **Stolen Tower.** Simply holding the Inscrutable Tower and the staff hostage is enough to stay the hand of the Amethyst Academy in the short term, who are terrified of losing such a precious resource. A cunning foe could extort the Academy for all its worth by doing so. Although Eldrick Runeweaver might enact a last-ditch effort by launching a few schemes to reclaim the tower, if he's defeated, the distant Academy Directorate takes the long view and resorts to appeasement.

## Saint Selina's Monastery

This cloistered refuge lies on a small hill overlooking the Drann River in the South Ward of the city. Originally built when Drakkenheim only occupied the north bank, the city streets were built up around the monastery grounds over time. It served as the primary residence for the clergy of the Sacred Flame who tended the cathedrals and chapels throughout Drakkenheim. A few hundred acolytes and priests dwelt in humble comfort within its austere walls and living cells.

Lucretia Mathias and her close followers began gathering here shortly after they completed the first pilgrimages of the Falling Fire. The area is completely covered by the Deep Haze and the nearby waters are contaminated, but those who complete the sacrament are immune to such hazards and can rest in Drakkenheim normally. As such, the otherwise lightly defended abbey is an ideal sanctuary for the most devoted adherents of the Falling Fire. Roughly a hundred sanctified members of the Falling Fire dwell within the monastery proper now, but hundreds more occupy the squalid campsite that has sprung up immediately outside the monastery.

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe  
> 
> I swear I can point to this place on a map, but actually getting there is another story.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/125-07-012.saint-selina-monastery.webp#center)

### Interactions

Followers of the Falling Fire live in a tight community and know each other quite well. Everyone here has taken the sacrament.

#### Visiting the Monastery

The Followers of the Falling Fire do not permit anyone who has not completed the Sacrament of the Falling Fire to enter the monastery for any reason. Those who wish to meet with Lucretia Mathias may meet her outside the gates or in the surrounding campsite.

#### Defences

The Followers of the Falling Fire are largely disorganized and live casually within the monastery, safe with the knowledge that few dare approach their sanctuary within the Deep Haze. Nevertheless, a group of six [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) and [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) are stationed at each of the front gates and passages into the cloisters.

##### Blessings of Protection

Lucretia Mathias has permanently warded the monastery cloisters, tower, and chapel with [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) and [forbiddance](Mechanics/spells/forbiddance.md) spells. As such, when a creature who is not a Follower of the Falling Fire enters the area, it must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or become [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) while it remains within. On a success, the creature ignores this effect until it leaves the monastery. These effects cannot be dispelled while the Brazier of the Falling Fire remains lit in the chapel.

### Area Details

Saint Selina's Monastery is a broad building composed of two abutting square cloisters with a sixty-foot-tall fortified tower rising between them, and an adjoining chapel of the Sacred Flame. Most of the plastered sandstone building is only twenty feet high with a sloping terracotta roof.

#### Monastery Garden

##### Monastery Walls

Rings of tiered lawns and a ten-foot-high fieldstone wall surrounds the grounds. Two wrought-iron gates allow access up a gravel path towards the monastery entrances.

- 4 [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) and a [berserker](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) are posted at each gate.  

##### Gardens

These were once lush and peaceful gardens, but the plans have now withered and turned to dust. The trees are dead and plants petrified.

##### Follower's Tents

A makeshift encampment of dozens of simple canvas tents fills the garden surrounding Saint Selina's Monastery.

- During the day, `10d10` sanctified [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) gather around meager campfires set up amongst the dingy tents and stinking hovels here, but at night hundreds huddle close to sleep in truly squalid conditions.  

#### Cloisters

Each cloister consists of a ten-foot-wide pillared aisle surrounding a square courtyard. Stone benches and long-faded frescoes decorate the tiled path underneath the awning roof.

##### Entrance Passages

A ten-foot-wide covered passageway barred with heavy oaken doors allows entry into each cloister. They are kept open during the day, and barred at night.

- 4 [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) led by a converted [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) keep watch at each entrance at all times.  

##### Courtyard

The centre of each cloister is a broad lawn criss-crossed with gravel paths. Tall long-dead petrified trees stretch up above the monastery rooftops, and the grass is now merely dead scrub. At the centre of the north courtyard is a covered well that draws water from the city aqueducts, which is surprisingly still functional. The centre of the other is a circular fountain decorated with an angelic statue.

- `10d6` [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) are praying or meditating in each courtyard.  

##### Monk's Cells

Along three sides of each cloister is a row of a dozen cells. Accessed via small rickety wooden doors that are seldom locked, these practical stone chambers are tidy and unadorned. Each is no more than ten feet in width and fifteen feet long, and contains two straw mattresses with rough spun sheets, a writing table, a bucket, a satchel with an extra set of clothing for each occupant, and a few candlesticks. Two small square windows look out from each. One row of cells each have a backdoor that leads to individual small disused vegetable gardens ringed by a four-foot-high wall.

##### Scriptorium

The Followers of the Falling Fire have set up two printing presses salvaged from the wreckage of the South Ward in this chamber, which was once the monastery library and scriptorium. They have disposed of the ruined books which once filled the shelves to make space for print moulds, sheets of parchment, bottles of ink, and other printmaking and bookbinding supplies.

- 12 [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) work around the clock producing printed copies of the *Testament of the Falling Fire* or pamphlets describing the proclamations of Lucretia Mathias. The finished copies are neatly placed in nearby crates and wagons for transport into the wider world.  

##### Common Hall

Inside this large hall are three rows of long tables set with wooden benches. Disciples of the Falling Fire prepare simple meals of broth and gruel in the kitchen.

#### Abbess' Tower

This sixty-foot-tall tower has four creaking wooden floors. One is now used as accommodations for Lucretia Mathias herself, the others are used for meditation or meetings. Much like her followers, she keeps austere living conditions with a simple straw bed and a writing desk. The rest of the floors contain the scrolls and theological texts moved out of the scriptorium.

- When she is not personally leading a pilgrimage to the Crater's Edge or delivering sermons in the courtyards, [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) spends her time in the tower composing new writing. She rests here each night.  
- `1d4` very rare [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) from the cleric spell list are kept here.  
- 6 [cavaliers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md), paladins of the Sacred Flame who converted to the Falling Fire, keep watch over the tower as the personal protectors for Lucretia Mathias. At any given time two are sleeping whilst the others are on patrol, and the other two are posted here.  

#### Chapel of Saint Selina

This chapel abuts the main cloister and is accessed from the courtyard. It is a round building with a domed roof.

##### Chapel

The brass brazier at the heart is alight with [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md). So long as this brazier remains lit, the [hallow](Mechanics/spells/hallow.md) and [forbiddance](Mechanics/spells/forbiddance.md) effects warding the abbey cannot be dispelled.

##### Crypts

When a sanctified member of the Followers of the Falling Fire dies, the disciples collect their delerium soulstones and store them in this crypt with the remains of Saint Selina.

- Lucretia Mathias has summoned two [planetars](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) to act as crypt guardians here.  
- The Followers of the Falling Fire keep the [Helm of Patron Saints](Mechanics/items/helm-of-patron-saints-dodk.md) here.
