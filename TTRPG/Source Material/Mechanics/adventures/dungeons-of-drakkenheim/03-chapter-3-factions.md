# Chapter 3: Factions
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 20* 

This chapter describes the roleplaying traits, resources, and major NPCs for each of the five factions. Each dossier is broken down into the following sections:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/006-02-001.large-argument.webp#center)

## Background

This details a brief history of each faction and its recent activities in Drakkenheim.

### Objectives

These describe the faction's major goals in Drakkenheim. Most concern two core conflicts that define the campaign: *Who should control Drakkenheim? What should be done about delerium*? Conflict is inevitable because every faction desires very different outcomes with regard to these questions. All wish to control the ruins and decide how delerium will be used (or destroyed). In addition, some factions have additional objectives which may directly oppose those of a rival faction.

Each faction's **Roleplaying Traits** resonate strongly with their **Objectives**. However, a faction may tolerate setting aside or even adjusting its objectives if it perceives a chance for greater gain in the future; if acting on its objectives would incite overwhelming retribution from political forces beyond Drakkenheim; or if circumstances emerge where achieving its objectives would contradict the faction's own ideals. In such a situation, a faction might even modify its objectives. Player characters might create alliances or expose weaknesses in the factions by taking advantage of this fact.

### Key Figures

Each faction has two major NPCs: the faction leader and their lieutenant(s). The stat blocks for these characters are detailed in Appendix B, and their roleplay traits are provided here. Use these NPCs as the player characters' primary points-of-contact during faction interactions such as:

- Briefing or hiring the characters for a mission,  
- Meetings and diplomatic negotiations,  
- Sharing information, advice, and creating mutual plans,  
- Offering rewards or resources to the player characters on behalf of the faction.  

#### Faction Leader

A formidable legendary non-player character commands each faction. These faction leaders issue orders to faction agents, direct faction resources, and make the final decision on how the faction acts in all matters. Each has their own individual Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws, and perhaps a few dark secrets too! As conflict in Drakkenheim escalates, the player characters should interact with the faction leaders often, and might even bring several faction leaders together for negotiations.

The faction leaders spend most of their time coordinating strategy and logistics within their faction stronghold. They are the organizational lynchpin for their entire faction, and rarely take to the field. A faction leader should only personally venture into Drakkenheim for a major gathering or offensive involving the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or a faction stronghold. The risk to the faction is simply too great to risk their lives in the field otherwise.

If a faction leader is slain or permanently [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), the faction must withdraw from Drakkenheim shortly thereafter unless there is someone else to take up their mantle. Surviving faction agents may seek immediate retribution, but the death of a faction leader seals their defeat in Drakkenheim for the foreseeable future.

Under the right circumstances, a player character who demonstrates unwavering belief in the faction and great leadership could rise through the ranks and replace a faction leader.

#### Faction Lieutenant

The faction lieutenant is the right-hand of the faction leader. As such, the lieutenant is usually the first point of contact the player characters have with a faction, and most can be encountered in Emberwood Village. Once the lieutenant is confident the players are capable and trustworthy collaborators, they'll facilitate an introduction with the faction leader.

Many lieutenants also lead elite faction strike teams. If the lieutenant is slain, the faction leader will appoint another faction member as a replacement.

#### Supporting Characters

Each faction has numerous rank-and-file members, support staff, craftspeople, recruits, and other followers. Use these lists to generate quick NPCs who might be guarding a stronghold, relaying a message, maintaining the supply lines, or fighting alongside (or against!) the player characters. You can add additional NPCs to the factions if you wish, but be careful when adding high-level NPCs or spellcasters capable of casting spells above 3rd level. The factions have specific and limited access to high-level magic. Powerful NPCs are meant to be rare so the player characters may rise to a position of importance and prominence during the campaign.

### Roleplaying Characteristics

Much like a player character, every faction has Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws. Rather than qualities of any individual person, these describe ideological beliefs shared by all faction members. Use these characteristics to guide roleplaying interactions with faction agents, determine the way the faction behaves, and judge how their leaders might react to changing circumstances or unexpected events.

Faction NPCs often possess these characteristics, but may have their own personal interpretations. However, a faction that betrays its ideals or bonds has betrayed its own members. When a faction repeatedly fails to uphold its own ideals and bonds, its agents might start deserting Drakkenheim or refuse to comply when called to action.

### Strongholds

Most factions have several holdings in Drakkenheim, but one major location is the faction stronghold. Full details on each faction stronghold are described in chapter 8. This is where most faction members reside and where many faction resources are kept. If a faction loses its stronghold, the rank-and-file members are routed and the power of the faction is broken. If the faction leader survives, they may still be able to muster together a few remaining diehard agents to cause a few more complications for the player characters, but the faction teeters on the brink of defeat.

> As useful as magicians and wizards can be when organized, You should always have a bag of tricks...for sale of course.

### Missions

The faction leader or faction lieutenant may present these missions to the player characters, which further the faction's objectives. The missions are presented in a rough progression: those presented first may lead to later ones. Characters who complete these missions gain greater respect and trust from the faction, and are rewarded with faction boons (described below). In addition, when the player characters complete a faction mission they receive experience points based on the advancement method you are using (as described in Character Advancement in chapter 2).

Many missions are directly tied to the **City Locations** described in chapters 6 and 7. In such cases, further details for running that mission are found in the "Adventure Hooks" section of the location entry. Other missions are open-ended adventure seeds to spur interactions with other factions. Nevertheless, you should feel free to invent additional missions for the factions based on the player characters' choices. Especially when the factions clash against each other, the player characters themselves collaborate with their faction allies to devise their own missions and specific goals.

### Boons

Every faction possesses valuable resources and knowledge they use to advance their agenda, including equipment, information, magic items, mounts, spellcasting services, and more. These are represented by faction boons, which may be awarded to the player characters for completing faction missions, but also offered to player characters *before* a mission to help them complete it.

These boons are presented in a roughly escalating order: latter boons should only be offered later in the campaign to characters who have demonstrated their commitment to the faction. Unless otherwise indicated, a faction can only offer each boon once. Beyond this, how often you reward characters with a faction boon is up to you.

#### Other Resources

The factions' exact assets and wealth are intentionally abstract so you may exercise your judgement and decide what's appropriate given the circumstances. Regardless, the factions do not have infinite resources. Every faction is stretched thin, and must cope with severe limits and constraints on their finances, personnel, materials, equipment, and time. The nearest large city is several weeks' travel away and the surrounding villages have been abandoned. More troops require exponentially more supplies since there are so few uncontaminated food and water sources. For many of the factions, simply maintaining the ground they currently hold requires everything they've got. **This is why the factions need the player characters to help them.**

The characters may occasionally demand more from the factions; citing dire need or urgent circumstances. If the characters push hard for more resources and appeal to the factions' ideals, objectives, and bonds, you might grant them an additional boon for that mission. However, the next time the characters need help from the faction or would receive a boon, the faction can't offer them anything as they are recuperating their stockpile!

### Strike Teams

While the factions seek assistance from the player characters, they aren't without their own agents. When they must dispatch their own warriors directly into the ruins, they send a **Strike Team**.

![Queen's Men Thug](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/007-02-002.queens-men-thug.webp#center)

An allied faction might send strike teams as reinforcements to help the player characters on a critical mission. Consequently, an enemy faction can dispatch a strike team against the player characters to disrupt missions, capture them, or even assassinate them. Each faction keeps tabs on the player characters, and might even send a strike team to interfere during a mission that wouldn't otherwise involve them just to sabotage the characters' efforts. More ruthless factions might take the fight directly to the characters' doorsteps, hitting them while they are retreating, recuperating, or simply unprepared for battle. Especially devious GMs may opt to have faction strike teams operate behind-the-scenes by carrying out attacks while the player characters are occupied elsewhere!

#### Mustering Forces

Any faction can call up a strike team within a few hour's notice. However, mustering up larger forces for major offensives takes time. When a faction needs to assemble multiple teams at once to perform a specific task, it takes at least one day per strike team involved. This can give characters the chance to notice something big is being planned.

#### Reinforcements

The factions regularly bring in reinforcements and new recruits. However, increasing casualties amongst the rank-and-file devastate morale within all the factions, and it's a problem when its more elite strike teams are captured, defeated, or killed. When a faction strike team is destroyed, it takes roughly five days for the faction to assemble a replacement team. Under desperate circumstances, a faction can put together another group immediately. Should this group also be taken out, it takes ten days to draw up further replacements thereafter.

#### Retribution

Faction leaders often investigate when their agents go missing. Each faction possesses a web of informants, [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), and [spies](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md), and can possibly use magical means to find out what happened. Unless an active effort is made to conceal what occurred, most factions can discover the fate of their agents within seven days and possibly even determine who was responsible. Skirmishes between adventurers and low-level faction agents are relatively common in the ruins, so such events may not incite immediate retribution, but rather careful observation. If the situation continues to escalate, the faction responds.

#### Major Offensives

Every faction knows that sending large numbers of soldiers into Drakkenheim is a foolish risk: several attempts have been made by much larger forces and failed. The biggest issue is contamination: there simply aren't enough spellcasters and materials to remove it quickly enough. Generally speaking, the factions will only consider launching major offensives if it means taking the cathedral, Castle Drakken, or another faction stronghold.

### Schemes

Should your player characters become enemies with one of the factions, the factions enact these dastardly plots against them. These schemes are presented in escalating hostility; so latter schemes are only used in dire conflict. Set one of these schemes into motion the next time the player characters venture into the ruins. If the players manage to foil the faction's schemes, the defeated faction will need at least a week before they can muster up another. On the other hand, the factions don't do things "just to get revenge". They instead consider their long-term goals first. They retreat, regroup, and find a way to attack from a position of strength.

You can invent your own schemes. Try using a strike team in a creative or unexpected way, or consider the personal capabilities of each faction leader: especially the spells, magic items, and unique knowledge at their disposal. Don't be afraid to turn the player characters' own motivations, goals, and flaws against them either!

### Faction Reputation

#### Champions

The player characters have demonstrated themselves to be staunch supporters of the faction's cause. They've successfully completed multiple missions for the faction that prove their loyalty, including a mission where they acted directly against another faction. The faction offers the characters complete access to their resources, support, and information. The characters receive faction boons to help them complete missions.

#### Allies

The party and the faction are working together to advance their mutual goals, but they have some minor differences and disagreements. Characters might be working with multiple factions in this manner. The characters have helped the faction in several ways by completing a few missions, and proven themselves reliable and capable. The faction rewards characters with boons after they complete these missions.

#### Indifferent

They are neutral. Perhaps they aren't known to each other yet. The faction is willing to hire the party on a freelance basis to help fulfil their objectives—especially ones that require arms' length interaction (such as working against another faction), but the faction doesn't trust the players yet. They may have had some rough interactions with low-level faction members, so the faction won't offer the players resources, support, or information beyond what is required to fulfil any missions they hire them to do. The faction might offer to trade for services and pay the characters in gold rather than grant them boons.

#### Adversaries

There isn't any trust here. The players show disregard for the faction's objectives. Minor skirmishes may have broken out with low-level faction members. The faction won't let the players use their resources or help. If the players want to repair the relationship, the faction offers the players a chance to complete a mission to demonstrate their commitment, possibly by striking directly at a rival faction. The faction occasionally sends strike teams to impede the party, disrupt their goals, and dissuade them from entering the city. However, these teams don't try to kill the characters. If violence breaks out, these strike teams either knock the characters out to try to capture them, deescalate, or flee.

#### Enemies

The characters have betrayed the faction's trust, murdered its members, and are working against the faction's most important goals in a profound way. The faction actively tries to thwart the characters using its schemes, and sends its deadly strike teams against the the characters.

## The Amethyst Academy

> [!quote] A quote from Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver  
> 
> Suffice to say, the Amethyst Academy has developed the means to harness the incredible arcane energies contained within delerium. We shall use it to create unfathomable magical wonders on a scale hitherto undreamt of, for the betterment and protection of all people. Only the Amethyst Academy has the knowledge to accomplish such a feat, and the wisdom to temper the wild and destructive potential of this volatile resource.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/009-02-004.amethyst.academy.webp#center)

The Amethyst Academy is a research institute, educational organization, and mage guild pursuing the arcane mysteries of delerium. The faction is small and outwardly aloof, yet subtly influential and tremendously wealthy. They are led by a shadowy directorate of powerful archmages who dispatched Archwizard [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) to oversee their operations in Drakkenheim. Most of its members are potent arcane spellcasters with access to rare magical resources, but only a handful of agents are active in Drakkenheim.

### Background

The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for young sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame. The mages located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities with trained and refined control. The secret school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.

Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane and cosmological phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry. Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.

![Eldrick Runeweaver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/010-02-005.eldrick-runeweaver.webp#center)

When these schemes were discovered by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those that supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with the Edicts of Lumen (detailed in Appendix E). Enacted three hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent.

The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst Academy guardianship of any child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age and master their abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land, rank, or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest stronghold was cut off from them.

While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the terms that forbid dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving an arcane conspiracy to control commerce and influence politics while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Sacred Flame.

### Attire

Agents typically wear purple robes, cloaks, or hoods.

#### Academy Rings

Members of the Amethyst Academy each wear a set of rings made from exotic arcane metals. The number of rings worn corresponds to the highest level spell they can cast. Known as *academy rings*, these are magic items that identify them as an Academy graduate, and often permit access to Academy strongholds. A set of five or more functions as a [ring of spell storing](Mechanics/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md), and some allow control over a [shield guardian](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md). However, each set is made for a specific individual, and only that person may attune that set of academy rings.

### Strongholds

The Amethyst Academy does not currently have a dedicated base of operations in Drakkenheim. Indeed, one of their most important objectives is reclaiming the Inscrutable Tower, so it can be used for such purposes!

#### Emberwood Accommodations

For the time being, most Academy members simply make use of local accommodations: Eldrick and River have booked a permanent suite in the Red Lion Hotel. However, the Amethyst Academy has secretly created a permanent [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) in the cellar beneath the abandoned Eventide Manor in Emberwood Village. Academy agents come and go from the cellar using [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) spells.

#### Distant Fortresses

Far away from Drakkenheim, the Amethyst Academy has many great fortresses, libraries, and universities. Most notable are the Enigma Ziggurat in the Free City of Liberio, and Paradox Castle in the distant Eastern Vale. Both have well-guarded [teleportation circles](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md), and Academy agents working in Drakkenheim usually teleport back and forth between these strongholds and the secret circle in Emberwood Village. The sigil sequences of these teleportation circles is a closely guarded secret known only to Academy mages who can cast 5th level spells.

## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Symbol

A lidless arcane eye set within an octagram. Their colours are gold and purple.

### Personality Traits

- We act businesslike and professional when dealing with the wider world.  
- We put arcane theory into magical practice. Innovation, creativity, and invention must have purpose.  
- We do not trust outsiders, and don't volunteer information that is not requested or required. Non-magical folk rarely grasp arcane matters anyways.  

### Ideals

- We rigorously study and carefully teach arcane magic. We value eldritch knowledge, through which we may harness the power of the cosmos itself.  
- Mages can accomplish incredible wonders by working together effectively. We are protected and strengthened by our disciplined hierarchy.  
- There is no such thing as evil magic, but some mages misuse magic for evil purposes. Unfortunately, those who do not practice the arcane arts rarely grasp such nuance.  

### Bonds

- The Amethyst Academy safeguards occult secrets that would be abused and feared by the wider world. What others view as dangerous, we seek to understand.  
- We cannot allow the brutal suppression of arcane magic to ever occur again, so we respect the Edicts of Lumen. We must maintain the trust of the nobility and avoid arousing suspicion and hostility from the Faith of the Sacred Flame.  
- We use wealth accumulated by selling magical services to educate young mages and support further arcane research. Our students are our future, and they must be kept safe.  

### Flaws

- Since we are so often misunderstood, we act in unseen and secret ways.  
- We are researchers and scholars, not warriors. Risking our talented members is wasteful and reckless when their minds can be put to much better use. Other lives are disposable.  
- We believe only Academy mages possess the intelligence and wisdom to wield arcane magic in a responsible way. Magic users who aren't Academy members are undisciplined amateurs at best, and more often become unhinged villains.

> The Academy proves to be mysterious and secretive at every turn, but I know not to ask too many questions if I want to bring home the bacon. I'd be a fool to bite the hand that feeds me.

### Objectives

#### Collect and Study Delerium

Far away from Drakkenheim in secret laboratories, Amethyst Academy wizards relentlessly research delerium samples recovered from the ruins. Their brilliant minds have crafted potent arcane artefacts and invented mighty new spells powered by the vast energies contained within the crystals. Though the true origin of delerium remains unknown to them, many Academy assets are now dedicated to the study and refinement of delerium. They procure enormous quantities to fuel their esoteric experiments and eldritch industries. Rather than risk their own members' lives in the ruins of Drakkenheim, the Academy usually obtains delerium through various grey market sources, typically by hiring adventurers.

The mages do not disregard the dangers presented by delerium's contaminating properties. In fact, it is precisely because of these hazards that the mages believe only they can use the crystals responsibly. Thus, the Academy seeks complete control over this critical resource both to protect the wider world and to secure their magical hegemony for the foreseeable future. However, other factions are now moving to reclaim Drakkenheim and potentially install a new ruling dynasty. Such political upheavals could affect the Academy's ability to research and harvest delerium. The Academy does not want a ruler who will destroy delerium, force the Academy to pay exorbitant sums to obtain it, or impose conditions on how the Academy may use the crystals.

Ultimately, the Academy has zero interest in seeing Drakkenheim restored and rebuilt, and view this as a folly doomed to fail. Rather, they have an ambitious plan to transform the city ruins into a quarry for their research and industry. Once they fulfil their other goals, the Amethyst Academy wants the other factions to totally abandon Drakkenheim so they can have sole control over the ruins.

![Inscrutable Staff](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/011-02-006.inscrutable-staff.webp#center)

#### Reclaim the Inscrutable Tower

Drakkenheim was home to one of the Amethyst Academy's most important strongholds: the Inscrutable Tower. This immense structure houses vast repositories of magical lore, incomplete magical experiments, hidden vaults containing unspeakable extraplanar entities, and powerful magic items sheltered from the world at large—all rendered completely inaccessible to the Academy since the meteor fell. The Deep Haze has settled within the tower, scrambling the Academy's own arcane wards and foiling every attempt to enter or observe the Tower using teleportation or divination magic.

The mages have already expended considerable effort attempting to retake the Tower on their own. These attempts catastrophically failed. The pragmatic wizards cannot afford to exhaust the Academy's resources in such a fruitless manner any longer, so now they turn to research and patient methods to advance their goals in Drakkenheim. They seek a suitably talented, trustworthy, and expendable adventuring party to conduct survey and recovery missions into the Inscrutable Tower. If the Tower were to be secured and repaired, the Amethyst Academy would have the ideal staging ground to begin the mass industrial exploitation of delerium, and would be able to bring its full resources to bear in Drakkenheim.

#### Obtain the Inscrutable Staff

Many talented mages were lost or killed by the meteor strike—including the former Archmage of Drakkenheim, Adriana Modiera. Her position on the Archmage's Directorate has remained vacant ever since. The Academy desperately wishes to discover her ultimate fate, recover her research, and obtain the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md), the symbol of office for the Archmage of Drakkenheim, which is also one of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*. Traditionally, the Archmage of Drakkenheim acts as an advisor on the royal council, so possessing this *Inscrutable Staff* ensures the Amethyst Academy maintains their influence in the political destiny of Westemär.

### Key Characters

Archwizard [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) heads up the Amethyst Academy operations in Drakkenheim and serves as the faction leader. The tiefling mage [River](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) works alongside him as lieutenant.

Eldrick Runeweaver serves as the acting Archmage of Drakkenheim within the Academy Directorate, but this is a provisional position. He will not be confirmed to a lifetime appointment until he successfully secures the Inscrutable Tower. He is accountable to the Academy Directorate, but only reveals his true position to close collaborators. Although he does not lead the Amethyst Academy as a whole, his death or defeat would cause the Directorate to seriously reevaluate their position in Drakkenheim.

#### Eldrick Runeweaver

One of the finest professors in the Amethyst Academy, [Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) has personally instructed a generation of talented arcane spellcasters. He is the foremost living expert on abjuration magic, but is also highly regarded within the Academy as a dedicated administrator and calculating leader. If Eldrick Runeweaver successfully retakes the Inscrutable Tower, he will likely take up the vacant spot in the Academy Directorate and assume the mantle of Archmage of Drakkenheim.

Eldrick Runeweaver is a towering and broad-shouldered man in his mid-sixties. His amber eyes glow softly behind his circular glasses, and he has a square-cut, greying black beard. He wears nine rings of silver, gold, and electrum: one on each finger except his left thumb. He wears flowing purple garb with golden embroidery, and carries an obsidian staff tipped with a delerium crystal.

- **Personality Trait.** I carefully calculate my every action, and I speak using a few well-chosen words. I'm a teacher at heart, so I often phrase my responses in the form of a pointed question.  
- **Ideal.** I will seek out more information whenever I encounter an unknown situation or problem. Through reason and logic, the facts always bear out the truth of the matter.  
- **Bond.** I hold a position of responsibility and authority within the Amethyst Academy, and it is my duty to protect the Academy's interests, carry out its agenda, and keep its many secrets.  
- **Flaw.** I care deeply for my students, but tend to overlook their faults and failures. I've had several wayward apprentices over the years, and I've often had to cover up their mistakes.  

[Eldrick Runeweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/eldrick-runeweaver-dodk.md) has a [cat](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/cat.md) familiar, and travels with an [iron golem](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) bodyguard and a [homunculus](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/homunculus.md) servant. He most often communicates via [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md), [telepathic bond](Mechanics/spells/rarys-telepathic-bond.md), and [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) spells, or by sending his [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md) instead. Eldrick always has a [contingency](Mechanics/spells/contingency.md) spell in place, and has a [clone](Mechanics/spells/clone.md) kept in a distant stronghold with extra equipment should the unthinkable occur.

##### Eldrick's Simulacrum

This special [simulacrum](Mechanics/spells/simulacrum.md) uses the game statistics for an [Archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md).

##### Eldrick's Spellbooks

Eldrick keeps many spellbooks in secret places, which contain every spell on the Wizard spell list except [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) (knowledge of this spell is restricted to the Academy Directorate).

#### River

![River](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/012-02-007.river.webp#center)

River is a tiefling [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md). She is a short woman in her late twenties. Her attire is practical and professional, a hip-length purple jacket with a high collar, and belted at her waist are several pouches and pockets. She wears five rings on her right hand. Two oddly-shaped dark brown horns sprout backwards from her flowing blue hair, creating the impression of two boats at sea. River has spotted brown skin and impish features: her teeth are too sharp, her tongue too long, and it's slightly unsettling when she smiles.

- **Personality Trait.** I converse using precise academic terminology, but amongst those I trust as competent and capable, I inject a wry and sardonic sense of humor.  
- **Ideal.** I like people who are professional, deliver results, and don't ask questions. I cannot stand fools who waste my time with buffoonery, haggling, and excuses.  
- **Bond.** Eldrick Runeweaver is my mentor, teacher, and friend. I've worked alongside him for years, and any success he has will be mine as well.  
- **Flaw.** I grew up surrounded by the magical amenities of the Amethyst Academy, so I don't understand what life is like for those who had a more mundane upbringing.  

River always has [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) and [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spells prepared, and is accompanied by her [imp](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) familiar and a [shield guardian](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md) bodyguard. She wears a [ring of spell storing](Mechanics/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md) that also acts as her [shield guardian control amulet](Mechanics/items/shield-guardian-amulet-idrotf.md). Only River can attune to this ring. She also carries `2d6` uncommon [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) or potions.

#### Academy Mages

A handful of other [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) lead survey teams in the ruins. Here are several NPCs to fill out the various Academy agents the player characters may encounter in Drakkenheim:

- **Rufus Stonewall.** A grumpy old professor who is looking forward to retiring.  
- **Nimble Quill.** An eager new graduate hoping to prove themselves.  
- **Cogsworth B. Copperpot.** An addled old diviner confused about his own predictions.  
- **Murdok the Caller.** A know-it-all conjurer with a knack for having the perfect spell prepared.  
- **Corvus Greysky.** A grim necromancer with a morbid sense of humor.  
- **Elvira Evermore.** A stern abjurer who takes magic use very seriously.  
- **Luna Mumph.** A young gnome illusionist who seems lost in her own world.  
- **Harmon Munk.** An elf transmuter who is always misplacing his alchemical reagents.  
- **Neptune Lee.** A charismatic enchanter who likes to boast about his accomplishments.  
- **August "Gus" Elderfire.** An experienced evoker who never does things by the book.

If the Amethyst Academy learns about the formula for [aqua expurgo](Mechanics/items/aqua-expurgo-dodk.md), they'll dispatch characters to gather samples from Queen's Park. (See chapter 7)

#### Broker an Alliance

The Amethyst Academy asks characters to broker a truce with either the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md), the Hooded Lanterns, or possibly, the Followers of the Falling Fire so they can secure their supply of delerium and access to the ruins.

#### Plight of the Pale Man

Slay the [Pale Man](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/pale-man-dodk.md) and acquire his spellbooks. (See chapter 7)

#### End the Iron Banshee

Seek out and destroy Ryan Greymere, the Iron Banshee. (See chapter 7)

#### Reclaim the Inscrutable Tower

The Amethyst Academy asks characters of 9th level or higher to participate in a raid mission to reclaim the Inscrutable Tower. (See chapter 8)

#### Expedition to the Crater

The Amethyst Academy commissions the characters to mount an expedition to the Crater Basin and see what's there. (See chapter 7)

#### The Sequestered City

Once the Amethyst Academy completes its goals of obtaining the [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) and claiming the Tower, they ask the characters to help them subtly manipulate or sabotage the other factions into leaving Drakkenheim. (See chapter 10)

### Boons

#### Arcane Supplies

The Amethyst Academy gives each character one uncommon potion or [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) (of a spell from the Wizard spell list) of their choice when they begin a mission that directly advances the Academy's goals. Higher-level characters with proven reputations may be offered items of rare or very rare quality instead.

#### Arcane Spellcasting Services

River and Eldrick Runeweaver can offer their services as spellcasters to the characters as needed (they won't personally travel to the ruins, however).

![Living Deep Haze](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/013-02-008.living-deep-haze.webp#center)

#### Material Components

The Amethyst Academy can provide material components for spells of 5th level or lower, whose sum total value is no more than 500 gold pieces, prior to any mission.

#### Occult Lore

The Amethyst Academy is the foremost authority on magical lore and arcane phenomena. Their sages can answer questions about contemporary magic, magical creatures such as constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead, any spell or magic item in the Core Rules, and historical facts about the past five hundred years. If you feel the matter is something that might require some deeper research, it takes the Academy one week to unearth relevant information. The Academy uses its discretion when revealing details about sensitive topics—especially information about the meteor or delerium, and never reveals its own secrets or details about its internal politics to outsiders.

#### Elemental Summons

If the player characters have a reasonable need for reinforcements during a mission, the Amethyst Academy offers the characters an [elemental gem](Mechanics/items/elemental-gem-dmg.md).

#### Magical Artifice

As a reward for completing an Academy mission, the [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) offer the party one uncommon magic item of their choice, subject to GM approval. The Amethyst Academy grants this boon once per player character. Once each character has received an uncommon item, the Academy will begin granting them one rare item each, then one very rare item each, as appropriate for completing missions of commensurate importance.

#### Guild Membership

A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard who can cast spells of 5th level or higher is offered guild membership in the Amethyst Academy. If they accept, they are given a purple [robe of useful objects](Mechanics/items/robe-of-useful-items.md), a [wand of magic missiles](Mechanics/items/wand-of-magic-missiles.md), and a [ring of spell storing](Mechanics/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md). These items bear Academy iconography, and clearly identify the character as an Academy member when worn.

#### Library Gift

Characters instrumental to retaking the Inscrutable Tower who demonstrate a complete commitment to the Academy's ideals and goals are rewarded with their choice of a [manual of bodily health](Mechanics/items/manual-of-bodily-health.md), a [tome of clear thought](Mechanics/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md), or a [tome of understanding](Mechanics/items/tome-of-understanding.md).

### Strike Teams

#### Summoned Spies

The Amethyst Academy agents send summoned creatures and magical constructs into the ruins to gather information: either 7 (`2d6`) **mephits**, 2 (`1d4`) [imps](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/imp.md), or a single [homunculus](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/homunculus.md). As magical communications are disrupted in the Haze, these creatures must survive and escape the city to report their findings, so they rarely engage in combat. These creatures often do not survive these missions, and some get lost and never return. Nevertheless, they're an essential tool for the Academy to have eyes and ears inside Drakkenheim.

#### Academy Survey Team

Though rare, a handful of [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) lead survey teams into the ruins to carry out field research. They are typically encountered conducting experiments, observing magical phenomena, facilitating communications between other Academy agents, and providing magical support as needed. However, if the situation in Drakkenheim escalates, these agents help by casting spells, orchestrating traps, and summoning creatures.

A survey team is led by a [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) with a [pseudodragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md) familiar and a [shield guardian](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md) bodyguard. The [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) wears a [ring of spell storing](Mechanics/items/ring-of-spell-storing.md) that also acts as a [shield guardian control amulet](Mechanics/items/shield-guardian-amulet-idrotf.md), but only the mage can attune to this ring. They also possess `1d6` uncommon [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) or *potions*. They always have the [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) and [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) spells prepared.

Most travel with `1d4` research assistants: either [hedge mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md) or academy apprentices. An Academy Apprentice uses the game statistics of a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) with Intelligence 13 and the ability to cast two cantrips and one 1st level-spell from the Wizard spell list. (Spell Attack +3, Spell Save DC 11)

#### Bound Elementals

When the Amethyst Academy requires extra muscle, they conjure elemental creatures and press them into their service using [planar binding](Mechanics/spells/planar-binding.md) spells. [Air](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md), [earth](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md), [fire](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), and [water elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) are popular additional bodyguards for Academy Surveyors, and the Amethyst Academy will conjure [invisible stalkers](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) if they need to dispatch a dangerous enemy.

### Schemes

The Amethyst Academy is a surreptitious foe. When the Amethyst Academy acts, it does not appear to be doing anything at all. They conduct their affairs like a business, and orchestrate events behind the scenes to turn out in their favour.

#### Magical Surveillance

If the player characters pose a threat to Amethyst Academy's goals, the [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) begin using [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spells to observe the characters when they are outside the Haze, and send summoned spies to tail them within the city. At first, their aim is to simply learn as much about the characters and their plans as possible, then use this knowledge to dispatch their own strike teams to disrupt the players. Eventually, they may begin using [dream](Mechanics/spells/dream.md) spells to interrupt their rests!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/014-02-009.amethyst-academy-wax-seal.webp#center)

#### Well-equipped Rivals

If the player characters do not work with them, the Amethyst Academy invests its resources in rival adventuring teams instead. In tandem with their magical surveillance, the Amethyst Academy sends these rival adventurers to sabotage the characters missions. In many cases these rival adventurers are given a false premise and don't actually know disrupting the player characters is their primary purpose. The Amethyst Academy might even charge rival adventurers to accomplish one of the player characters' goals before they can do it (such as taking the Clocktower, recovering a Relic of Saint Vitruvio, finding a Seal of Drakkenheim, or something important to a personal quest). They keep the item as a bargaining chip.

#### Shadow Assassins

Should the Amethyst Academy need to dispose of the characters entirely, they dispatch one [invisible stalker](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) per character to carry out the deed while the characters are sleeping. They use a [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spell to confirm the characters are resting, and a [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md) spell to move their agents into position nearby. If the characters are using magical means to protect themselves, such as a [tiny hut](Mechanics/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md) spell, they send one [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) who casts [greater invisibility](Mechanics/spells/greater-invisibility.md) upon themselves and then casts [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) to destroy the barrier. The [invisible stalkers](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) are instructed to coordinate their attacks on one character at a time, starting with healers and spellcasters, and will attack downed characters to confirm a kill.

#### Stark Demonstration

Under the flag of truce, the Amethyst Academy invites the player characters and faction leaders to attend a demonstration of their latest creation with delerium. Known as the Disjunction Bomb, this devastating weapon can annihilate an entire city district. They matter-of-factly detonate a test weapon in a cleared wilderness area, and then offer to discuss terms with the characters and the factions about how to best proceed.

## The Followers of the Falling Fire

> [!quote] A quote from Lucretia Mathias  
> 
> One day soon, we will near the end of our world—an age where great heroes will be needed. These holy stones were heaven-sent so we might prepare our spirits to meet the all-consuming shadows. In our darkest moment, the Sacred Flame will set alight our blazing hearts as one.

The Followers of the Falling Fire are a religious sect who believe the meteor signalled a celestial prophecy, and consider delerium a holy sacrament. Called to pilgrimage by the prescient testament of their leader, [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md), zealous masses of devout common-folk now journey to the crater's edge to take their place in a divine plan.

### Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/015-02-010.falling-fire.webp#center)

The Faith of the Sacred Flame has long looked to the stars for guidance. The flickering stars cast within the Astral Void symbolize how the faithful see their place in the cosmos: points of light holding darkness at bay. Scripture tells how a shooting star inspired Saint Tarna to seek redemption before a pair of angels. The story of a blackguard turned paladin who founded the Faith itself established an important message within the religion: that from the deepest darkness may arise the brightest light.

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) was one such Flamekeeper who read omens in the night sky, and was regarded as one of the most learned and wise amongst the clergy. She channeled immense divine power, and invoked miracles that have not been witnessed in a generation. A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star that would arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful. Despite her reputation, her visions were dismissed as an apocalyptic fantasy and largely suppressed at the time.

Her visions proved true; right down to the hour. However, even Lucretia Mathias did not expect the actual destruction the meteor would cause, nor did she anticipate it would annihilate her birthplace, Drakkenheim. She spent several years afterwards contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, Lucretia Mathias prophesied a New Age of Heroes that could meet the coming night. She spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.

![Lucretia Mathias](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/016-02-011.lucretia-mathias.webp#center)

Meanwhile, the mainstream clergy reacted to delerium with disgust and horror. When Lucretia Mathias returned from her pilgrimage bearing a delerium crystal embedded in her own body, she was declared a heretic and excommunicated. However, she refused to be silenced. Escaping Elyria, she expanded her original writings and published them as the *Testament of the Falling Fire*. This religious essay proclaimed a radical new doctrine for the faith, and called upon all devout believers to make pilgrimage to the crater in Drakkenheim. Those who finish this arduous journey partake in a controversial rite known as the [Sacrament of the Falling Fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md).

#### Attire

The Followers of the Falling Fire give up most of their worldly possessions. Many are clad only in sackcloth jerkins or monastic robes, and often carry salvaged weapons adapted from everyday equipment and tools.

#### Strongholds

While the Falling Fire is now sending missionaries out all over the world, they have four important holdings in Drakkenheim.

##### Hendrix Farm

Pilgrims camp out here in Emberwood Village before embarking on the last stage of their journey to the crater.

##### Champion's Gate

Not a stronghold in any true sense, the pilgrims use Champion's Gate as a waypoint on their way to the crater's edge or Saint Selina's Monastery.

##### Chapel of Saint Gresha

Located on the edge of the crater, this is the place where Lucretia Mathias performs the [Sacrament of the Falling Fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md) each day at dawn.

##### Saint Selina's Monastery

Located in the Deep Haze, this is the sanctuary for members of the Falling Fire who have completed their pilgrimage and taken the Sacrament.

## Roleplaying Characteristics

- **Symbol.** A soaring comet. Their colours are black and white.  

### Personality Traits

- We often speak prayers and quote the writings of Lucretia Mathias. We enthusiastically share the message of our new faith with everyone.  
- We are fascinated by the stars, and see omens and prophecy in everything.  
- We see hope for the downtrodden and absolution for the lost. We offer deliverance and mercy for any who seek the truth and the light, but we condemn those who do not.  

### Ideals

- A New Age of Heroes shall meet the Creeping Darkness that threatens the world. Through our devotion, we shall light the Sacred Flame.  
- Every soul is worthy of redemption, you need only see the good within. From the darkest shadow comes the brightest light.  
- Material possessions and monetary wealth hold no value anymore. All that matters is our faith.  

### Bonds

- Delerium shards have a sacred purpose as the key to our salvation. They must only be used in our religious ceremonies. It is utter profanity to turn the stones into arcane trinkets, and total sacrilege to destroy the holy crystals.  
- The ruins are a holy site now. We must make a pilgrimage to the crater to take part in the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire*. This test of faith will demonstrate our devotion, and we will know our place in the divine plan.  
- We are disillusioned by the hypocrisy of the mainstream religious ministry of the Sacred Flame. The Flamekeepers have tarnished our faith with political ambitions and affluent vices.  

### Flaws

- Lucretia Mathias and her disciples who have completed the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire* have become living vessels for the Sacred Flame. We follow them faithfully and heed their every word unquestioningly.  
- The divine prophecy of Lucretia Mathias is irrefutably true. Any evidence to the contrary is merely a deception meant to dissuade us from our righteous path.  
- The old world shall inevitably end in darkness, petty political squabbles and earthly concerns are meaningless compared to our holy mission.  

> [!quote] A quote from Pluto Jackson  
> 
> What strange manners to travel into the dangers of this city with nothing but faith as a shield. The border between brave and foolish is thin among them.

### Objectives

#### Transform Drakkenheim into a Holy Site

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) has proselytized that hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of devoted followers will need to complete the pilgrimage to fulfil her prophecy. Once they do, the Sacred Flame will set alight every righteous mortal heart, and a glorious new age of heroes shall begin. Until then, they must ensure many more can make the journey, and preserve the delerium, the sacred charcoal needed to enact their rituals. Thus, they wish to make Drakkenheim itself a holy site.

![Nathaniel Flint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/017-02-012.nathaniel-flint.webp#center)

Those who complete their pilgrimage to the crater's edge participate in a ritual called the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire*. This controversial rite requires supplicants to impale a delerium fragment into their hearts. Those who survive the pilgrimage are spiritually transformed and physically empowered, rendered immune to contamination and able to survive in the Haze. Many who complete the pilgrimage suddenly discover they are able to tap into powerful spiritual energies, which they claim are the Sacred Flame. Thus many followers channel divine magic who had not before exhibited the necessary willpower to master such abilities.

#### Spread and defend their new faith

The Followers of the Falling Fire seek to convert others to take up their cause and their beliefs, no matter their former lives. They believe members of the Hooded Lanterns and the Silver Order could be convinced to abandon their organizations to join the Followers of the Falling Fire.

Should a new ruler of Westemär emerge, the Followers of the Falling Fire wish to convert this individual to their faith. Doing so will legitimize the Falling Fire politically, and make sure that they can continue their pilgrimages.

At the same time, they must defend their faith. The Followers of the Falling Fire have been declared heretics and excommunicated by the clergy of the Sacred Flame, and must protect themselves from attacks (both physical and political) by the Knights of the Silver Order.

#### Claim the lost relics of Saint Vitruvio

Drakkenheim was home to many saints of the Sacred Flame: most notably, the heroic Saint Vitruvio, who fought astride the mighty gold dragon Argonath centuries ago. Both were buried beneath the cathedral that bears his name. Many relics of this mighty paladin are lost in Drakkenheim, such as [Ignacious, the Sword of Burning Truth](Mechanics/items/ignacious-the-sword-of-burning-truth-dodk.md). If the Followers of the Falling Fire were to obtain these relics and resurrect the dragon it would significantly legitimize their beliefs to many laypeople.

They wish to reclaim these artefacts and reconsecrate the altar of the Sacred Flame in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio. The [Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md) is also one of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*. Traditionally held by a Flamekeeper of the Sacred Flame, possessing it ensures the Followers of the Falling Fire gain influence over the political destiny of Drakkenheim and Westemär.

### Key Characters

The vast majority of the Followers of the Falling Fire are commoners, mere pilgrims seeking salvation in the ruined city. Many bring children, infirm, or sick family members seeking miracle healing. Hundreds have arrived already, and thousands more are coming.

#### Lucretia Mathias

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) is a willowy and wizened woman with piercing eyes and pursed lips. She is in her early nineties, and keeps her greying black hair in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. She wears simple grey robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. Her garb lightly conceals the delerium shard embedded in her heart.

- **Personality Trait.** I speak in proverbs and quote scripture when I speak, inspiring others to interpret my cryptic words and come to their own revelations.  
- **Ideal.** The brightest lights shine in the darkest of places. None are beyond redemption, and all may find their inner truth and purpose by following the Falling Fire.  
- **Bond.** I have foreseen the inevitable end of our world, but through our sacred self-sacrifice we shall set alight the Sacred Flame to bring enlightenment and salvation to the universe.  
- **Flaw.** I only reveal the greatest truths I have seen to those I am certain can grasp them fully, and will understand them as I do.  

#### Nathaniel Flint

Nathaniel Flint is a human [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) who completed the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire*. He is an animated and jovial man in his early thirties, with medium length curly brown hair, mutton chops, a bushy mustache, and a flushed face. He does not wear armour, and instead wears pilgrims' robes with a roped belt and a tabard emblazoned with the sign of the Falling Fire. A scarfed hood conceals the delerium shard embedded in his chest.

- **Personality Trait.** I approach every situation with a carefree eagerness.  
- **Ideal.** I see the prophecies of Lucretia Mathias as completely reasonable and true, and don't understand why anyone wouldn't embrace them.  
- **Bond.** There is no greater purpose to my being than to help others find their divine light and true purpose in the crater.  
- **Flaw.** Everything that happens is part of a divine plan, no matter how horrible or unfortunate, it was always meant to be.  

##### Secret Identity

At your option, Nathaniel Flint may in fact be Leonard von Kessel, but he has no memory of this fact. Alternatively, he could be connected to the royal family in some other way.

#### Pilgrims of the Falling Fire

Here's a few readymade NPCs who are travelling to Drakkenheim to complete their pilgrimage:

- **Brother Abraham Schaefer.** A faithful old preacher naïve to the horrors of Drakkenheim.  
- **George Hopper.** A courageous fighter who dutifully protects other pilgrims.  
- **Anita Winters.** A strong and sturdy warrior who had visions of the meteor.  
- **Dekota Jones.** A young explorer who questions everything.  
- **Cosmos.** An optimistic tiefling who is obsessed with planar travel.  
- **Rufus Apollo.** An old dwarven cleric who studies astrological signs and patterns.  
- **Ingrid and Mara Stumer.** Sisters who followed dreams and visions to the city.  
- **Silvie Roseshot.** A former Flamekeeper inspired by the Testament of the Falling Fire.  
- **Lucy Wainwright.** A creative and intelligent woman with a child who came to the city for salvation.  
- **Jared Walsh.** A young paladin who believes he will fulfil his oath by taking the Sacrament.  

### Missions

#### Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio

Retrieve the holy relic from the Chapel of Saint Brenna. (See chapter 6)

#### The Lost Disciple

A prominent disciple went missing near the Black Ivory Inn. (See chapter 6)

**Dwarven Defilers** Drive out the Ironhelm Dwarves who are mining delerium in the Scar. (See chapter 6)

#### Pilgrims' Plight

The vast majority of the Followers of the Falling Fire are common folk. There are few warriors amongst them. Protect a pilgrimage from Emberwood Village to Champion's Gate.

#### Pilgrimage of Falling Fire

Characters of 6th level or higher who faithfully serve the Falling Fire are invited to take the pilgrimage to the crater. (See chapter 7)

#### Lighted Lanterns

The characters are tasked with convincing the Hooded Lanterns to convert to the Falling Fire and serve their cause.

#### Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral

Destroy the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) and retake the cathedral. Afterwards, help us consecrate the Brazier for the Falling Fire and retrieve [Ignacious, Sword of Burning Truth](Mechanics/items/ignacious-the-sword-of-burning-truth-dodk.md).

#### A Messenger of Faith

Entreat members of the Silver Order to back down and join our cause - otherwise, destroy them!

#### Drive out the Faithless

We shall put an end to the Amethyst Academy's experiments with the holy delerium by invading the Inscrutable Tower. (See chapter 8)

#### Shield of the Sacred Flame

An expedition to Castle Drakken is needed to recover the fabled shield of Saint Vitruvio.

#### Awaken Argonath

We will need a pristine delerium geode from the Delerium Heart at the centre of the crater to complete the resurrection of Argonath.

#### A Worthy Disciple

Lucretia Mathias is wizened, and though her divine powers imbue her with vigour, she is not long for this world. She has not yet found a true disciple who could take up her mantle after she passes, and she knows that her followers will need to rally behind a new leader when she is gone.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/018-02-013.worshiper-andreiaugrai.webp#center)

### Boons

#### Divine Spellcasting Services

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) can offer her services as a spellcaster to the characters. She can help them recover via spells such as [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [prayer of healing](Mechanics/spells/prayer-of-healing.md), [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md), [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md), [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md), and [heroes' feast](Mechanics/spells/heroes-feast.md). While characters must still provide any costly material components, she does not charge them to cast the spells.

#### Celestial Lore

Lucretia Mathias is an unparalleled expert on celestial phenomena, cosmology, religion, and divine magic. In addition, she possesses unique insight about delerium and the meteor, and has prescient divine visions. While she could conceivably answer questions about anything, she speaks in prophecy and mystery, and often encourages others to "seek the truth for themselves." She's more likely to guide characters towards an answer than outright reveal it. For example, while Lucretia Mathias has personally ventured to the centre of the crater and knows what lies there, she believes others must witness it firsthand. Furthermore, she has her own subjective point of view about events coloured by her faith, though she sincerely believes them to be true.

#### Prophecy

Lucretia Mathias can cast a wide range of divination spells, including [commune](Mechanics/spells/commune.md), [divination](Mechanics/spells/divination.md), [legend lore](Mechanics/spells/legend-lore.md), and [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md). She will cast these spells to gain knowledge and insight about future events.

#### Revive the Fallen

Lucretia Mathias is willing to cast [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md), [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md), or even [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) upon a faithful champion. She will use delerium as a material component for these spells, and so any character raised by her gains a form of [indefinite madness](Mechanics/tables/indefinite-madness.md).

#### Sanctified by the Falling Fire

Characters who demonstrate full faith and devotion to the Falling Fire are invited to make a pilgrimage to the crater's edge and partake in the Sacrament of the Falling Fire. This ritual imbues characters with powerful protection against the Haze, but has a serious cost.

#### Relics of the Faithful

As a reward for completing an important mission, the Followers of the Falling Fire will grant the party one magical rod, staff, or wondrous item from their reliquary. This will be an uncommon item for an Outer City mission, a rare item for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a very rare magic item for a successful mission to Castle Drakken or the cathedral. This boon can be granted multiple times, once for each character in the party. The Game Master can either choose the item, or allow the player to choose it.

#### Testament of the Falling Fire

Lucretia Mathias allows characters to read one of her original manuscripts. These take the form of a [Tome of Clear Thought](Mechanics/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md), a [Tome of Understanding](Mechanics/items/tome-of-understanding.md), and a [Tome of Leadership and Influence](Mechanics/items/tome-of-leadership-and-influence.md).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/019-02-014.incense-brazier.webp#center)

#### Sanctified by the Falling Fire

The [Sacrament of the Falling Fire](Mechanics/spells/sacrament-of-the-falling-fire-dodk.md) is known only to [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) and [Saint Gresha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/saint-gresha-dodk.md), who cast the spells each day at dawn and dusk respectively at the Chapel of Saint Gresha on the crater's edge. A character who participates in the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire* gains the following traits, so long as they adhere to the tenets and faith of the Falling Fire:

- You gain advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and resistance to "necrotic" and "radiant damage". You are immune to contamination.  
- If you die, your soul enters the delerium fragment embedded into your chest. You can't be raised from the dead while your soul is in the fragment.  

The embedded delerium fragment does not contaminate or otherwise harm a character who keeps their conviction.

#### Loss of Faith

A character who violates or loses their faith in the Falling Fire loses the protections of sanctification and the beneficial traits above. Instead, their body is directly exposed to the delerium in their chest and they immediately gain one level of contamination. Until the fragment is removed or they atone for their sins, their hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (`3d6`) and they gain a level of delerium contamination each time they finish a long rest.

#### Sanctified Delerium

A delerium fragment filled with a sanctified soul glows with golden light. It becomes inert and immune to all damage except bludgeoning damage from magical weapons. Sanctified delerium possesses no other magical properties and is worthless for all arcane applications. A creature holding the fragment can telepathically communicate with the soul held within. If a sanctified fragment is destroyed, the soul inside is utterly annihilated, but the fragment can be used in a spell to return the dead soul within to life.

#### Removing the Fragment

The sacrament ritual fuses delerium to the body. The fragment can only be physically removed through great effort, requiring one hour of work and a DC 25 [Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine) check. On a successful check, the fragment is removed but the sanctified character suffers 55 (`10d10`) damage. The fragment can be harmlessly removed from a willing creature using a [heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md) or [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell.

## What has Lucretia Mathias foreseen?

Within the quotation at the start of this section, the entire truth of Lucretia Mathias' visions are laid bare. While it might *seem* like she is speaking in metaphor, she is actually being quite literal. Lucretia Mathias has seen how the Haze will consume the world, but also knows that the spread of delerium through comets has continued for untold eons. She intends to break this cycle.

"From the deepest darkness comes the brightest light." is a core doctrine for the Sacred Flame, and Lucretia Mathias. believes the chaotic and destructive energies of the Haze and delerium can be re-made into a vessel for light and order.

One must only plant the seed of righteousness within. Thus the purpose of the *Sacrament of the Falling Fire* is only realized when participants die and their souls are drawn into the delerium crystals in their chests. Lucretia Mathias believes that if enough of these sanctified stones are gathered by the time the world ends, a divine apotheosis will result in a new generation of harbingers of light and salvation, rather than chaos and doom. Whether or not this will actually happen is impossible to say. Since Drakkenheim is a world of distant and unknowable gods, there is no way to prove or disprove her claims. It is entirely a matter of faith.

### Strike Teams

The Followers of the Falling Fire lack military training and possess few resources. What they do have, however, is great faith and determination. In battle, the Followers of the Falling Fire surge forward in a mob to engage in zealous combat. However, they staunchly defend one another and look out for their fellow believers. They have little regard for tactics or strategy, believing instead that their actions are guided by divine providence instead. They rarely retreat.

#### Pilgrimage

A mob of 21 (`6d6`) [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) led by a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md). Such groups may also include several noncombatants, as well as wagons pulled by draft animals such as oxen or mules.

#### Militant Faithful

10 (`3d6`) [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) led by 2 (`1d4`) [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md).

#### Sanctified Zealots

An assorted group of 7 (`2d6`) [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md), [cult fanatics](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md), and [priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md). These individuals have completed the Sacrament, and have the Sanctified by the Falling Fire traits.

#### Converted Clergy

Any other strike team might be joined by a [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md), [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md), or [cavalier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) originally a member of the mainstream clergy who has shifted their faith to the Falling Fire. Many might even be former members of the Silver Order.

#### Angelic Avenger

[Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) can summon `1d4` [devas](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) or a [planetar](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) to lead another strike team.

### Schemes

#### Celestial Visions

If the player characters pose a threat to Followers of the Falling Fire, Lucretia Mathias begins using [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spells to observe the characters when they are outside the Haze, and using [divination](Mechanics/spells/divination.md) and [commune](Mechanics/spells/commune.md) spells to learn about their personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Her aim is to simply learn about the characters, their motivations, and actions.

#### Compelling Plea

Lucretia Mathias uses her knowledge of the player characters to implore them to join the Followers of the Falling Fire. She uses information gleaned about the characters' ideals, bonds, and flaws to impress the importance of her own visions. She makes prophecies and delivers omens that the characters will not succeed without faith, and perhaps even exposes their vices, flaws, and past sins. However, in bringing up the characters' failures, secrets, and flaws, she offers them hope for atonement and absolution by joining her.

#### Salvation and Penitence

If the characters are in dire circumstances, Lucretia Mathias receives a vision of their plight and dispatches a Falling Fire strike team to rescue them.

The strike team brings the characters back to Saint Selina's and offers them healing and help, but also takes their possessions and tries to forcefully convert them. They may even imprison the characters until they repent.

#### Conversion

If the player characters have any family members or loved ones, the Followers of the Falling Fire seek them out and attempt to convert them. Alternatively, they convert members of the Queen's Men, Silver Order, or Sacred Flame to join them.

#### Truth of the Crater

Lucretia Mathias invites the player characters to accompany her to the centre of the crater so they can see for themselves the truth of what is to come. If they do not agree to join her, she incites the monsters therein to attack, relying on her own divine power to protect herself.

## The Hooded Lanterns

> [!quote] A quote from Lord Commander Elias Drexel  
> 
> There cannot be a Westemär without Drakkenheim.

The Hooded Lanterns are an **irregular military force** drawn up from remnants of the old Drakkenheim City Watch and veterans of the Westemär Civil War. Led by the grim [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md), they wish to drive out the monsters and outlaws who infest their nation's capital and restore the realm of Westemär.

### Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/020-02-015.hooded-lanterns.webp#center)

Multiple military operations have attempted to retake Drakkenheim over the past fifteen years. Each has ended in miserable failure, and the contaminated ruins have swallowed thousands of soldiers' lives. What remains of these assaults are merely twisted monsters and undead monstrosities formed from the risen corpses of these regiments. After these disastrous attempts, Drakkenheim was left abandoned while civil war ripped Westemär apart instead. These conflicts also ended in vain, with the royal line of House von Kessel undone by fratricide.

Westemär is slowly disintegrating into a realm of squabbling fiefdoms, yet some amongst the fractured nobility hold a glimmer of hope in restoring the nation and rebuilding the capital. Three years ago, they marshaled up the remnants of the royal guard, the city watch, and patriotic veterans of the civil war to make one last-ditch attempt to retake the city. Although officially dubbed the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, this guerilla regiment was nicknamed after oil lamps carried by the old city watch: the Hooded Lanterns.

The core members of the Hooded Lanterns are warriors fighting for their homeland. Few honest soldiers survived the civil war, so many veterans have a life of bloody deeds behind them already. On the other hand, new recruits are seldom old enough to have any strong memories of Drakkenheim before it was destroyed. As such, many possess naïve and idealistic notions honed into simmering rage and fury at a golden age stolen from them.

Under the leadership of [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md), the Hooded Lanterns have finally broken the losing streak of previous military operations. Rather than making an all-out assault on the ruins, they have taken a methodical approach. After spending nearly a year carefully scouting out the ruins, they began clearing out important fortifications in the city to use as staging grounds for future operations. This strategy has paid off: the Hooded Lanterns have managed to establish countless safehouses and supply caches within the city. They captured Shepherd's Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison last year. However, in recent months their efforts have been stymied by sabotage enacted by the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md), and the emergence of a horrific [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) warlord in the Inner City known as the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md). While the Hooded Lanterns have imposed the mantle of law-and-order in the city, these setbacks have revealed their actual authority is limited to their strength of arms. The regiment maintains only a fragile foothold in Drakkenheim, and their supply lines are now exceptionally difficult to maintain. It's taking almost everything the Hooded Lanterns have to hold their current position.

![Elias Drexel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/021-02-016.elias-drexel.webp#center)

The Hooded Lanterns are supported by surviving loyal vassals of the royal family who wish to see the old monarchy of Westemär restored. Many of these wealthy nobles lost estates, treasure vaults, family heirlooms, and personal documents when the city was destroyed, and expect the Hooded Lanterns to retrieve them. In return, these noble houses provide soldiers, material, and other supplies to the Hooded Lanterns on a periodic basis, but their financial resources are not inexhaustible. Indeed, the Hooded Lanterns have often resorted to selling delerium themselves to make ends meet.

#### Attire

The Hooded Lanterns are a professional military unit. Every member uses standardized equipment: their uniform consists of a forest green cloak with yellow trim, the traditional colours associated with the Drakkenheim coat-of-arms. They bear the Hooded Lanterns' symbol on their chest pieces, and shoulder stitches denote their rank and company. Scout units wear light armour, and often wield [longswords](Mechanics/items/longsword.md), [shortswords](Mechanics/items/shortsword.md), and [longbows](Mechanics/items/longbow.md). Guard units are equipped with [chainmail](Mechanics/items/chain-mail.md), [shields](Mechanics/items/shield.md), [spears](Mechanics/items/spear.md), and crossbows. Each member also wears a metal chain with an inscribed plate bearing their name, hometown, and next of kin. Most Hooded Lanterns cut their hair when they sign up, but since many spend weeks at a time fighting, they end up a disheveled mess by the end of their assignments.

#### Strongholds

The Hooded Lanterns hold three key positions in Drakkenheim and its environs: the Emberwood Watchtower, Shepherd's Gate, and the Drakkenheim Garrison. They have converted the stockade beneath the garrison into a bunker insulated from the Haze. Beyond these key locations, the Hooded Lanterns have several minor bases in old cottages and watchtowers a few days outside the city where their soldiers rest and recuperate after being posted to the ruins.

## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Symbol

A hooded lantern held by a dragon's claw.

### Personality Traits

- We're not looking for glory or wealth, we're fighting for our home. We expect others to respect the seriousness and importance of our goals.  
- We are resolute in facing dangerous monsters and terrible horrors head on. These mutated creatures aren't human anymore.  
- If you're willing to join our cause, we'll embrace you as a loyal comrade-in-arms.  

### Ideals

- We all must do our duty to restore our nation. When your commander gives you an order, you follow it without question. You must be prepared to give your life for the cause.  
- In battle, you have to seize every advantage. A plan is worth more than any weapon.  
- We will uphold the old ways of Westemär. This must be a city of laws and order. They mean no less today than they did twenty years ago.  

### Bonds

- This city was our home, and it will be again. It's the heart of the realm. There cannot be a Westemär without Drakkenheim.  
- We trust our comrades-in-arms with our lives and are deeply loyal to one another. We staunchly believe that together we can accomplish what none of us could do alone.  
- The old nobility of Westemär provide us with material and supplies. We have a responsibility to ensure their investments and interests are protected, otherwise we won't have the resources to continue our fight.  

### Flaws

- After a decade of civil war and years fighting for survival in the ruins, most of us know nothing but war. Our young recruits don't even have any memory of the old Drakkenheim.  
- We all knew the risks when we signed up. If we are to win the battles ahead, we must be willing to sacrifice the lives of our comrades.  
- Drakkenheim must be rebuilt the way it used to be. The crown, the castle, the city must all be retaken and rebuilt. It wouldn't be home otherwise.

> Adapative and cunning, they are true survivalists. Some of the bravest warriors I've met in Westeimär.

### Objectives

#### Restore Drakkenheim

The patriotic warriors of the Hooded Lanterns desperately want to rebuild their former home. The rank-and-file soldiers fight a guerilla war to reclaim Drakkenheim street-by-street, slaying monsters, driving out outlaws, and arresting scavengers. [Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) plans on establishing strongholds at key sites of strategic importance: the City Gates, Saint Selina's Monastery, Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral, the Clocktower, and eventually, Castle Drakken. Thus far, the Hooded Lanterns have only succeeded in taking Shepherd's Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison.

![the master of the forge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/022-02-017.the-master-of-the-forge.webp#center)

#### Obtain the Seals of Drakkenheim

The ruling council of Westemär wore enchanted badges of office attuned to the magical defences and arcane wards that once protected Drakkenheim, and also served as the keys to Castle Drakken itself. Known as the *Seals of Drakkenheim*, all are lost within the ruins save the [Lord Commander's Badge](Mechanics/items/lord-commanders-badge-dodk.md), carried by Elias Drexel himself. Until all the seals are assembled, the city's magical defences are subject to the chaotic whims of the Haze. The Hooded Lanterns are constantly searching the ruins for any sign or clue of the whereabouts of these items. Unfortunately, several are already in the hands of rival factions. See Appendix D for their game statistics.

#### Re-establish a rightful monarchy

Many Hooded Lanterns hope a legitimate heir to the throne still survives somehow. Others believe that even if House von Kessel is truly extinct, a new monarchy could be formed by a prominent noble house with some connection to the royal line. Both Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral and Castle Drakken are believed to contain archives detailing the line of succession, and magically preserved vials of royal blood that can be used in a special ritual to confirm legitimate royal ancestry. A potential claimant with access to these documents could galvanize the support needed to ascend to the throne. However, proof of royal ancestry alone is not enough - any claim is spurious at best without the *Seals of Drakkenheim*, the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md), and Castle Drakken. Even a true heir to House von Kessel will have immense difficulty holding the Realm of Westemär together without these keys to power.

### Key Characters

[Lord Commander Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) leads the Expeditionary Force as the Faction leader. He has two close confidants who interchangeably act as the faction lieutenant: Captain [Ansom Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) and his sister, Lieutenant [Petra Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md).

#### NOTE

The Hooded Lanterns use a formal military rank structure. Although Ansom and Petra are ranked as "captain" and "lieutenant", this doesn't change their role as faction lieutenantsfor the purposes of their interactions with the player characters.

#### Lord Commander Elias Drexel

[Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) is a man in his early fifties. He is stocky and imposing with a furrowed brow and a grim frown on his wide and angular face. His harsh features are framed with a thick moustache, side chops, and a mane of long braided brown hair. He is garbed in chainmail armour with heavy leather gloves and boots, worn under a fur-lined dark green cloak and iron pauldrons. He wears a pinned brooch - the [Lord Commander's Badge](Mechanics/items/lord-commanders-badge-dodk.md), the symbol of his office. A quiver, a longbow, and two longswords are strung on his back.

- **Personality Trait.** I am blunt and direct, and expect my soldiers to obey my commands and deliver results promptly. I find no humor in anything.  
- **Ideal.** Loyalty and trust are priceless. They must be carefully given, but staunchly held. There is nothing worse than betrayal and treason.  
- **Bond.** During the Civil War, I switched sides and killed several scions of House von Kessel who could have claimed the throne. I once believed it was for the right cause, but now I feel personally responsible for breaking the royal line. My mission in Drakkenheim is penance and redemption.  
- **Flaw.** I'm filled with rage and conflict because of my contradictory actions and beliefs, and I don't take defeat, setbacks, or even missteps lightly.  

Elias Drexel was appointed to the office of Lord Commander before the fall of Drakkenheim, and was outside the city leading training drills when the meteor fell. Afterwards, he took part in three military expeditions to reclaim Drakkenheim, and saw firsthand their horrors. He then went on to fight in the Westemär Civil War alongside Mannfred von Kessel. However, the idea that his soldiers died for nothing in Drakkenheim festered in his mind, and made him doubt Mannfred's ability to be a good ruler. He secretly participated in a successful conspiracy to assassinate Mannfred von Kessel. Little did he know that shortly thereafter, tragedy would soon befall Cecilia von Kessel. He isn't exactly proud of his choice to betray Mannfred, and that causes him considerable guilt, regret, and internal self-loathing.

#### Command Staff

The Lord Commander has several important aides who assist with the day-to-day operations of the Hooded Lantern's forces:

- **The Warden.** a [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) who oversees the defences and dungeons of the City Watch Barracks.  
- **The Quartermaster.** a [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) who attends to the supply cache.  
- **The Apothecary.** a human [druid](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) who tends the wounded and manages their hospice.  
- **The Master of the Forge.** a dwarf [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md).  
- **Paige.** a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and personal attendant to the Lord Commander.  

#### Petra Lang

Lieutenant Petra Lang is a human [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md). She is a fit and nimble teenager with long black hair, a narrow pointed chin, and bold features. She wears a hooded green cloak and light chain armour of the Hooded Lanterns with a lieutenant's insignia on her shoulder pauldron.

- **Personality Trait.** I see the value in those willing to risk their lives in the ruins. I have great insight and trust in my own judgement of character.  
- **Ideal.** The right path is often the harder path, but it is always one worth walking.  
- **Bond.** I was adopted by Elias Drexel, who raised and trained me. I don't want to let him down.  
- **Flaw.** I am too open and trusting of people who claim to be on the same side as me, and I put a lot of weight in counting on people who I assume are able to handle themselves.  

#### Ansom Lang

Captain Ansom Lang is a human [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md). He is an athletic teenager with long black hair and a short neat beard, angular jaw, and rugged features. He is garbed in a hooded green cloak and light chain armour of the Hooded Lanterns that prominently displays a captain's insignia on his shoulder.

- **Personality Trait.** I have been in Drakkenheim long enough to know not to trust anyone. I am extremely wary of adventurers, and anyone who might cause problems for the Lanterns.  
- **Ideal.** I believe that if my sister and I work hard enough, with the right people, that maybe we can change things.  
- **Bond.** Myself and Petra have had each other's backs since we were children. That will never change.  
- **Flaw.** I find reasons to not like people, and find reasons to doubt the commitment of the people around me.  

##### Royal Bastards

Ansom and Petra Lang were adopted by Elias Drexel during the Civil War. At your option, you may determine they are secretly the illegitimate offspring of King Ulrich von Kessel IV and an unknown mother. This fact was concealed to prevent a scandal, and even Elias Drexel doesn't know it. A letter revealing this could be found in the Steward's Archive in Castle Drakken.

#### Company Roster

The Hooded Lanterns are organized into a regiment of five companies, making up a total force of approximately one thousand soldiers plus their support staff, orderlies, and crew. Each company is led by a captain and two lieutenants, and each has a distinct role:

##### Scout Company

Intrepid infiltrators who undertake dangerous reconnaissance operations into the city centre. Led by Captain Raine Highlash.

##### Garrison Company

Protects the established holdings of the Hooded Lanterns such as the Watchtower, Shepherd's Gate, and the Drakkenheim Garrison. Led by Captain Jakob Slovak, the Garrison company operates at double strength, since these soldiers must be constantly rotated to prevent them from becoming contaminated while on duty.

##### Vanguard Company

These experienced shock troops carry out offensive operations against priority targets, led by Captain Ansom Lang.

##### Reserve Company

A reserve force maintained outside the city composed of new recruits and aging veterans charged with maintaining supply routes.

##### Royal Guard

A special unit activated only if the Hooded Lanterns discover a royal heir. This small unit is composed of veterans hand-picked by the Lord Commander for trustworthiness and skill.

#### Hooded Lanterns Soldiers

Below are several NPCs to fill out the various Hooded Lanterns guards and scouts the player characters may encounter in Drakkenheim:

- **Chud Hopkins.** A halfling [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) who occasionally helps with patrols or watches, or works as a chef in the barracks kitchen.  
- **Sten Livingston.** A human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) often positioned out in front of the City Watch Barracks as one of the head watchmen.  
- **Raine Highlash.** A human [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) who runs patrols around the Outer City.  
- **Jakob Slovak.** A human [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) of Shepherd's Gate.  
- **Luther Hess.** A rotund [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), lazy and unwilling to do above the bare minimum.  
- **Alena Kruger.** A calm human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) who prides herself in her observational skills.  
- **Tresa Metterling.** An optimistic [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) with a hopeful outlook for Drakkenheim.  
- **"Old" Symon Vasilisk.** An aging human [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) who rarely leaves the barracks and is on his way to retirement.  
- **Rolf Wagner.** A young man of [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) birth, sent to the city on his father's behalf to fight for the Lanterns.  
- **Greta Braun.** A young [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) with aspirations of climbing the ranks of the Lanterns.  
- **Alycia Martell.** Afraid of almost everything in Drakkenheim but determined to fight for her beliefs.  

### Missions

#### Missing Lantern

Petra Lang went missing on a recent supply run. Her brother, Ansom, has resolved to rescue her from the Rat's Nest Tavern. (See chapter 6)

#### Potions Inspectors

The recent shipment of health potions from [Oscar Yoren](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/oscar-yoren-dodk.md) never showed up. The Hooded Lanterns need someone to look into this matter and make sure Oscar is still upholding his end of their deal. (See chapter 6)

#### Dwarven Prospects

A group of intrepid dwarves has a delerium mining operation in the Smithy on the Scar, and have brought incredible equipment with them. The Hooded Lanterns want to make a deal with the dwarves to secure their equipment and a share of the delerium. (See chapter 6)

#### Resupply Mission

The Hooded Lanterns dispatch the characters into the Inner City to set up and resupply several hidden caches and safehouses.

#### Time for a new outpost

The Cosmological Clocktower has long been an important objective. Clear it out so the Hooded Lanterns can establish it as a forward base at the centre of the city. (See chapter 7)

#### Sizing Up the Silver Order

[Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) commissions the characters to approach the Silver Order as a neutral third party. He wants information: why they're here and what their plans are, and if they are open to an alliance or truce.

#### Hazy Solutions

The Hooded Lanterns don't possess a reliable defence against the Haze or a remedy to contamination. The Hooded Lanterns will need to secure the assistance of another faction to develop a means of dealing with the Haze: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, Knights of the Silver Order, or perhaps even the malfeasant wizards rumoured to dwell in the city. (See chapter 7)

#### Noble Backer

A wealthy [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) who supports the Hooded Lanterns, used to own the Kleinberg Estate. They demand the Hooded Lanterns obtain a family heirloom and personal documents left behind in the estate vault. Otherwise, they'll pull their crucially needed funding.

#### Audience with the Queen of Thieves

The Hooded Lanterns believe the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) has information and spies within the regiment, which have made it difficult for them to plant their own agent inside the Queen's Men. They commission the adventurers to try to infiltrate the Queen's Men, get close to the Queen of Thieves, figure out her plans, and find a way to bring her down.

#### Capture the Cathedral

The Hooded Lanterns ask characters to coordinate an assault on the cathedral to slay the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) and open the cathedral vaults. This will hopefully have crucial evidence for locating a royal heir. (See chapter 7)

#### Expedition to Castle Drakken

Once the Hooded Lanterns have assembled the Seals of Drakkenheim and found a new heir, they plan an attack on Castle Drakken to claim the castle, crown the new monarch, and use Minazorond to defend the city!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/023-02-018.shipment-box.webp#center)

### Boons

#### Supply Caches

The Hooded Lanterns have hidden stockpiles of supplies in the city for emergencies. They'll teach characters how to find them quickly. Each contains `1d6` [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) or a [restorative ointment](Mechanics/items/keoghtoms-ointment.md), [healer's kits](Mechanics/items/healers-kit.md), ammunition, specially preserved rations, and the location is usually a safe place to take a short rest.

#### Greencloaks

The Hooded Lanterns offer each character either a [cloak of elvenkind](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-elvenkind.md) or a [cloak of protection](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-protection.md) bearing the insignia of the Hooded Lanterns.

#### Armoury

As a reward for completing an important mission, the Hooded Lanterns grant the party one magical weapon from their armoury. This will be an uncommon magic weapon for an Outer City mission, a rare magic weapon for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a very rare magic weapon for a successful mission to Castle Drakken or the cathedral. The Hooded Lanterns will grant this boon once per player character.

#### Call for Aid

The Hooded Lanterns give the characters a flare gun and a horn that can be used as an action to summon emergency help. When used, help arrives 10 (`3d6`) minutes later in the form of a randomly determined Hooded Lanterns strike team. Player characters who call for help recklessly or without appropriate need lose this boon.

#### Intelligence Reports

No one knows the layout and the defences of Drakkenheim better than the Hooded Lanterns.

If asked, the Hooded Lanterns can provide detailed descriptions, directions, and information on the prominent structures in the city, maps of the city streets and public buildings, as well as information about the movements of known monster groups and other factions in Drakkenheim.

#### Urban Survival Training

Characters can spend one month training with veteran Hooded Lanterns soldiers to gain one of the following:

- **Ability Score Improvement.** The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.  
- **New Feat.** The character gains a new feat of their choice (subject to GM approval).  

### Strike Teams

The Hooded Lanterns are urban guerilla fighters honed by training, discipline, and experience. Their combat doctrine emphasizes organized teamwork, scouting ahead, stealth ambushes, hit-and-run tactics, seizing elevated ground, and heavy use of ranged attacks and traps. Once engaged, squads communicate using whistles, code-signs, signal flares, and horn calls to execute complex and practiced maneuvers. While the Hooded Lanterns don't have access to much magic, they're prepared to fight spellcasters in battle. They know much about the monsters they fight on a regular basis, and they always confirm their kills. The Hooded Lanterns know the layout of the city streets well, and stash caches of healing potions and emergency supplies throughout the city.

#### Supply Convoys

These supply convoys are often encountered in Emberwood Village and the northwestern side of the outer city, usually bound for one of the Hooded Lanterns' strongholds. Each consists of 10 (`3d6`) [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), 7 (`2d6`) [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), 2 (`1d4`) [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), and 5 (`2d4`) [mules](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/mule.md).

#### Scout Squad

A typical Hooded Lanterns unit consists of 10 (`3d6`) [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) led by an [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md). Smaller teams act as dispatch riders on [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md).

#### Garrison Squad

10 [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) led by a [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md). Occasionally, the garrisons have a [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md), either a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) or a [druid](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md). Such units may also have brought traps, field defences, or even crew siege equipment.

#### Vanguard Commando Squad

A Hooded Lanterns commando squad consists of 5 (`2d4`) [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) led by an [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md). These units employ the full playbook of Hooded Lanterns combat tactics.

#### Royal Guard

A group of 10 (`2d6`) [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) led by a [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md).

### Schemes

![The Apothecary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/024-02-019.apothecary.webp#center)

#### Search and Seizure

A squad of Hooded Lanterns confront the characters and demand the characters turn over their equipment and vacate the city immediately. If they are seen again, they will be brought to justice.

#### Blockade

The Hooded Lanterns forbid characters from entering the city via Shepherd's Gate. They step up patrols around the other gates to block characters from using them.

#### Stalkers

A Hooded Lanterns strike team tails the characters as they move through the streets. They assault the characters after they are weakened by a difficult encounter and attempt to arrest them.

#### Wanted

A series of wanted posters are put up around Emberwood Village with a reward for bringing the characters to justice. This draws the attention of Queen's Men bounty hunters as well as rival adventurers, and anyone else keen to make money to bring the characters to justice.

#### Deadly Ambush

The Hooded Lanterns set up extensive traps down a city street and lure the characters into a deadly ambush where two strike teams await on rooftops and in covered windows to surprise the characters. They attempt to encircle the characters in a pincer maneuver.

#### Crown Authority

The Hooded Lanterns banish the characters from Emberwood Village: local merchants refuse to do business with the characters as a result, and the characters won't be allowed to stay at any of the inns or taverns. The Hooded Lanterns place additional patrols in Emberwood Village at the watch tower and Caravan Court to drive out the characters when they come into town.

#### Strange Bedfellows

In desperate situations, the Hooded Lanterns ally themselves with another faction who also has made an enemy of the player characters.

#### Execution Sentence

The Hooded Lanterns orchestrate a deadly plan to draw the characters into battle against the Executioner of Slaughterstone Square. They blockade the roads and take positions on the roofs, preventing the characters from escaping the square while the Executioner kills them.

## Knights of the Silver Order

> [!quote] A quote from Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal  
> 
> These evil crystals are the stuff of dark magic; anathema to order and life itself. No goodness can come from their corrupt power, and those foolish enough to believe delerium can be turned to useful purposes are truly lost.

The Silver Order is an **elite church-sanctioned regiment** of paladins and ordained knights oath-sworn to combat supernatural evils, otherworldly incursions, and dark magic. As faithful devotees of the Sacred Flame, they believe delerium is a dangerous and contaminating blight. Led by the valiant [Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md), the knights have been dispatched to eradicate the corruption at its very source.

### Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/025-02-020.silver-order-symbol.webp#center)

The Silver Order was founded several centuries ago as a militant arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and paladins act by the decree of the Divine Matriarch to defend the faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witch-hunters when wayward mages dabble in forbidden arcana. Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order is headquartered in the Holy City of Lumen in Elyria.

Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame, as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin. Though not every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, each strives to emulate Saint Tarna's valiant example. Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies, occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and all levels of society. [Nobles](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) and [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) are found within the Order, and one's station in life does not reflect one's position in the Order.

In their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the order's honour, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith that calls out for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, staunch supporters of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were indeed justified. Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy. The chronicle of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions that have prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.

![Theodore Marshal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/026-02-021.theodore-marshal.webp#center)

The Silver Order answers to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, not to the command of any sovereign nation. However, the Order remains strongly connected to its roots, and most of its members hail from Elyria. Ever since the realm of Elyriacame under the de facto rule of the religious ministry, the order has become increasingly entangled in state affairs. Their knights have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics, heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. The distinction between an "enemy of the Sacred Flame" and an "enemy of Elyria" is not entirely clear anymore. As such, some worry the Order's presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a righteous expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.

#### Attire

As befits their name, the knights are clad in silver plate with gold filigree. They wear flowing tabards of white, prominently decorated with symbols of the Sacred Flame, rather than any individual heraldry. The Flamekeepers who accompany the knights wear religious vestments of white and gold.

#### Strongholds

The Knights of the Silver Order have built a military encampment known as Camp Dawn about two miles outside Drakkenheim, just on the outside edge of the Haze. Outside Drakkenheim, the Silver Order can often find shelter in any chapel or cathedral of the Sacred Flame, though not every Flamekeeper in Westemär now supports their mission. Their headquarters is the impregnable Vigilant Keep in the far city of Lumen in Elyria, where the Grandmaster oversees the entire order at the behest of the Divine Matriarch.

## Roleplaying Traits

### Symbol

A burning chalice upon a shield. Their colours are silver and gold.

### Personality Traits

- We conduct ourselves with honour and respect. We do not speak falsehoods, and we show compassion and courteousness for all, even our enemies.  
- We bravely stand up for what is right, and expect others to do the same.  
- We profess our faith openly, so all may bask in the warmth of the Sacred Flame.  

### Ideals

- We are united by faith in the Sacred Flame. All are called to uphold its tenets, and all must heed its wisdom. We cannot be divided by ancestry, nobility, or national creed.  
- We will never abandon the righteous to torment and death. Not while we have strength left to act.  
- Elyria has become a mighty realm through its faith in the Sacred Flame. It is a shining example that all other monarchs and rulers should emulate.  

### Bonds

- We are oath-bound to protect those who cannot protect themselves from supernatural evil, cosmic terrors, and malevolent sorcerers. We are the shield of the faithful and the torch against the darkness that comes from beyond. Evil must be uprooted before it can spread.  
- We are called to act by the Divine Matriarch of the Sacred Flame, and will always follow her decree.  
- It is our duty to protect the relics and holy places of our faith, and ensure they do not fall into wicked hands who would use them for vile purposes.  

### Flaws

- We never back down from a fight. If you challenge us, we will never surrender.  
- Those who do not follow the Faith of the Sacred Flame are misguided, especially those who worship other gods or twist the message of our faith. They have been turned away from the light through deception and falsehoods spread by charlatans.  
- Power corrupts, and nothing corrupts like arcane power. We don't trust arcane spellcasters, and we are prepared to strike against them should they work evil magic or traffic with fiends.

### Objectives

#### Destroy delerium at its source

The Divine Matriarch of the Sacred Flame has decreed delerium an unholy abomination. These chaotic seeds of evil magic must be wholly destroyed before they can take root. By her command, the Silver Order has come to cleanse Drakkenheim of this foul taint: even if it means burning the city to the ground. Furthermore, the knights have resolved to stop others from harvesting and using delerium, especially the Amethyst Academy.

The Silver Order insists that Drakkenheim - and by extension, the nation of Westemär - cannot be rebuilt until the threat of delerium is entirely eliminated. While the Silver Order does not intend to establish Elyrian rule over Westemär, they want to ensure any new ruler honours the Sacred Flame, commits to destroying delerium, and helps them dissolve the Followers of the Falling Fire.

#### Stamp out the heresy of the Falling Fire

The demagogue [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) has fractured the Faith of the Sacred Flame, and twisted its noble and pure religious teachings into the debased worship of a blasphemous and evil rock from the darkest depths of the outer void. Lucretia Mathias must be captured and brought back to Elyria to stand trial for her grave sins, where she may find repentance in a burning pyre. Her misguided followers must be driven from the city.

#### Preserve the holy relics in Drakkenheim

Drakkenheim was home to many saints of the Sacred Flame: most notably, the heroic Saint Vitruvio, who fought astride the mighty gold dragon Argonath centuries ago. Both were buried beneath the cathedral that bears his name. Many relics of this mighty paladin are lost in Drakkenheim, such as [Ignacious, the Sword of Burning Truth](Mechanics/items/ignacious-the-sword-of-burning-truth-dodk.md). The Silver Order wishes to reclaim these artefacts and reconsecrate the altar of the Sacred Flame in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, so it may serve as a beacon of light from which the rest of the city may be purged.

It is of vital importance to the Silver Order that these relics and places do not fall into the hands of the Followers of the Falling Fire, who they fear may use them for heretical purposes.

One of the relics of Saint Vitruvio is also one of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*: the [Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md). Traditionally, this item is entrusted to the High Flamekeeper of Drakkenheim. If the Silver Order obtains it, they can ensure the Faith of the Sacred Flame has some influence over the political destiny of Drakkenheim and Westemär by demanding who is appointed the new High Flamekeeper.

### Key Figures

[Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) is faction leader of the Silver Order in Drakkenheim. He keeps close counsel with High Flamekeeper [Ophelia Reed](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md), the faction lieutenant.

#### Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal

[Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) is a man in his prime. He is athletic and tall with boldly sculpted features, bronzed skin, and unkempt sandy brown hair. Unshaven stubble has grown into a beard over the criss-cross of scars on his face. A leather patch covers his right eye. He wears gleaming silver plate armour etched with golden trim, and carries a shimmering sword and a broad shield engraved with the symbol of the Sacred Flame.

- **Personality Trait.** I act with determined calm and respect. Little rouses my anger, instead I respond with disappointment when others incite my ire.  
- **Ideal.** I believe that good-hearted people can set aside their differences to work together.  
- **Bond.** I am willing to lay down my life for a just and righteous cause.  
- **Flaw.** I will never give up on my comrades. I do not trade lives.  

#### Ophelia Reed

High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed is a human [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md). She is a stout black woman in her late forties with a warm smile, rounded features, and braided hair. She wears the flowing yellow and white robes of a cleric of the Sacred Flame. She carries a silvered staff and a censer with a [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spell cast upon it.

- **Personality Trait.** I attentively listen to others, and respond from a place of warmth and kindness.  
- **Ideal.** I will always seek the right remedy for any ailment or problem, and offer my patient guidance to those who ask for it.  
- **Bond.** I have taken a vow of poverty and devoted my life to the service of the Sacred Flame.  
- **Flaw.** Darkness is all-consuming. Once it has taken root. For some, death is the only salvation.  

#### Silver Order Crusaders

The Knights of the Silver Order have marched the long road from distant Elyria. They have mustered a great strength of the Order, consisting of a hundred [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) and their retinues, men-at-arms, and retainers. Dozens of clerics of the Sacred Flame have joined their forces as well.

Below are several concepts for quick NPCs to fill out the ranks of the Silver Order knights, paladins, and clerics.

- **Knight-Lieutenant Cassandra Wyatt.** a human [cavalier](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) who leads the aerial units.  
- **Ser Virgil Underwood.** a human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md).  
- **Austin Edwards.** A young [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md), eager to leap into battle for his cause.  
- **Adam.** A stoic and thoughtful paladin with a cautious attitude towards Drakkenheim.  
- **Claudia.** A determined [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) with the qualities of great leadership.  
- **Delilah.** An aspiring Flamekeeper with a fiery attitude and strong will.  
- **Quinn.** A new recruit, optimistic and eager to impress her team.  
- **Elijah.** A paladin who takes great pleasure in defeating monsters in combat.  
- **Buddy Knox.** A guitar strumming bard who sings the deeds of the Knights of the Silver Order.  
- **Noah.** An aging man with a big white beard who takes things in stride.  
- **Ruth.** a Flamekeeper who takes her job as a healer very seriously.  
- **Zacharias.** An arrogant [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) who fears no monster or abomination in Drakkenheim.  

### Missions

#### Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio

Reclaim the lost relic in the chapel of Saint Brenna. (See chapter 6)

#### Dwarven Heathens

Drive out or destroy the dwarven smithy. (See chapter 6)

#### Witch Hunt

#### Make an Alliance

The Silver Order wishes to broker an alliance with the Hooded Lanterns if possible. However, we'll need to convince the Hooded Lanterns that it's in their best interests to burn down the city entirely, then rebuild.

#### Battle of Temple Gate

We need our own means to access the Inner City. We shall assault Temple Gate and wrest control of it from the [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md).

#### Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral

Destroy the [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) and retake the cathedral. Afterwards, help us relight the Brazier of the Sacred Flame.

#### Root out the Heretic

Capture [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md)!

#### Shattered Tower

If the Amethyst Academy will not be dissuaded to give up their pursuit of delerium, then we will cut them off from it entirely. Invade the Inscrutable Tower and destroy it from within!

#### The Resurrection of Argonath

Assembling the relics of Saint Vitruvio, the Silver Order attempts to resurrect the gold dragon Argonath, but they'll need the Diamond of Mount Kadath from the vaults of Castle Drakken to complete the spell.

#### Ashes to Ashes

Burn Drakkenheim to the ground and destroy the Delerium Heart.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/027-02-022.cassandra-wyatt.webp#center)

### Boons

#### Supplies

The Silver Order gives the party `1d4` [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) or [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) (of a spell from the cleric spell list) of their choice whenever they begin a mission that directly advances the Silver Order's goals. These will be uncommon items for missions to the Outer City, rare items for the Inner City or faction strongholds, and very rare items for missions involving the crater, Castle Drakken, or the cathedral.

#### Stables

The Silver Order offers each player character a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md). If the horse is killed, the Silver Order offers the characters another one.

#### Armoury

As a reward for completing an important mission, the Silver Order will grant the party one magical melee weapon, a magical suit of heavy armour, or a magical shield from their armoury. This will be an uncommon item for an Outer City mission, a rare item for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a very rare magic item for a successful mission to Castle Drakken or the cathedral. This boon can be granted multiple times, once for each character in the party. The Dungeon Master can either choose the item, or allow the player to choose it.

#### Divine Spellcasting Services

High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed can offer her services as a spellcaster to the characters. She can help them recover via spells such as [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [prayer of healing](Mechanics/spells/prayer-of-healing.md), [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md), [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md), and [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md). While characters must still provide any costly material components, she does not charge them to cast the spells.

#### Religious Lore

The Faith of the Sacred Flame believes knowledge is a form of illumination, and keeps historical texts and religious lore. Flamekeepers can answer questions about religious practices, magical creatures such as celestials, fiends, and undead, historical facts about the past five hundred years, and mythological stories about events that happened up to one thousand years ago. If you feel the matter is something that might require some deeper research, it takes the Flamekeepers one week (or `2d6` days) to unearth relevant information.

#### Take to the Sky

The Silver Order grants the player characters access to their griffons and training on how to fly them. Each character gains a griffon mount. If this mount is killed it cannot be replaced.

#### Revive the Fallen

Ophelia Reed will cast [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md) on a fallen player character of 9th level or higher who falls in battle fulfiling objectives of the Silver Order. They can provide the material components for the spell. The Silver Order will offer this boon once per player character. However, player characters of any level who are trusted by the Silver Order, provide the material component for [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md), and make an offering of 1,000 gold pieces to the Sacred Flame may also receive this boon.

#### Teachings of the Faith

The Silver Order allows characters to read from relic holy books of the Sacred Flame. They present them with a [Manual of Gainful Exercise](Mechanics/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md), a [Tome of Understanding](Mechanics/items/tome-of-understanding.md), or a [Tome of Leadership and Influence](Mechanics/items/tome-of-leadership-and-influence.md).

### Strike Teams

The Silver Order favours aggressive charges and defensive bastions, employing a "hammer and anvil" approach whether on the battlefield or in skirmishes. Their inspiring commanders drive their rank-and-file soldiers to greater acts of boldness and heroism, while the magical support of their clergy means they can tend the wounded and unravel evil magic levied against them. The Silver Order have superlative training in combating spellcasters and fiends, and know how to recognize the magic and tactics of such foes. They target spellcasters aggressively, and seek to break their concentration or end their spells using [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md).

Before a battle, the Silver Order draws up a straightforward battle plan, which they execute with discipline and focus. In all matters, they operate with honor. They will often reach out in parley before engaging, and even in battle they will often implore their foes to retreat or surrender once they seize the upper hand. On the contrary, members of the Silver Order expect no quarter themselves, and offer none to the wicked and unrepentant.

#### Questing Knight

![Ophelia Reed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/028-02-023.ophelia-reed.webp#center)

A lone Knight of the Silver Order often carries out missions accompanied by a personal retinue of 10 (`3d6`) [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md). This [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) is often mounted on a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md). Knights are occasionally accompanied by a smaller number of retainers who are also on horseback.

#### Silver Order Cavalry

This company of heroic knights consists of a group of 5 (`2d4`) [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) all mounted on or [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md). Such units are mustered for offensive operations on when force is certainly expected.

#### Silver Order Infantry

The knightly retainers sometimes form large infantry units equipped with spears and shields, pikes, or halberds: such units may include 35 (`10d6`) [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), perhaps more. They may be commanded by a single [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md). The Silver Order deploys such units to hold ground while their cavalry are charged with seizing it.

#### Clergy

Any Silver Order strike team may include support from a cleric of the Sacred Flame: either a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) or [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md). They may be accompanied by 3 (`1d6`) [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md). Sometimes several Flamekeepers gather together on their own for special circumstances when a great deal of divine magic is needed, or to perform religious rites.

#### Sky-Cavaliers

The elite air force of the Silver Order are units of 3 (`1d6`) [cavaliers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md) mounted on [griffons](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md). These riders strike like heavenly thunderbolts against ferocious monsters, flying demons, and other airborne threats, or descend from the sky upon wretched spellcasters and enemy leaders.

### Schemes

As an honorable military regiment, the Silver Order does not engage in subtle or stealthy schemes. Instead, they enact traditional military strategies with commensurate discipline and effectiveness.

#### Loyal to the Flame

The Silver Order petitions Flamekeeper Hanna in Emberwood Village to withhold her spellcasting services from the player characters.

#### Military Blockade

The Silver Order creates fortified outposts on the main roads leading into Drakkenheim. Each consists of a fortified watchtower and a palisade wall, and is garrisoned by 2 (`1d4`) [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md), 10 (`3d6`) [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md), and a [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md). They have [warhorses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) and ballistas. These blockades prevent outside supplies from reaching Emberwood Village or other strongholds within the city - most crucially, food.

#### Occupy Emberwood Village

The Silver Order mobilizes in force to take Emberwood Village. Unless the Silver Order is stopped, they drive out the other factions entirely and install a strict curfew on the villagers, effectively ending all trade and services within the town. The knights fortify the town and relocate their base of operations here, retaining a small garrison at Camp Dawn.

#### An Honourable Challenge

[Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md) challenges the most martially skilled player character to a one-on-one duel to the death. This honorable combat must be conducted without any external interference. If he wins, he immediately challenges another character to a duel under the same conditions. He repeats this process until either himself or the entire party is killed.

## Queen's Men

> [!quote] A quote from The Queen of Thieves  
> 
> Drakkenheim is mine. Nothing moves in Drakkenheim without me allowing it to happen. I have eyes on every street, a fix on every prize, and tabs on every would-be band of fortune-seekers. Only one can rule this city—me.

The Queen's Men are a loose affiliation between a hundred gangs of brigands, outlaws, and scoundrels, all who swear fealty to the enigmatic [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md). These reprobates prey upon pilgrims, prospectors, and explorers drawn to the city, extort and rob adventurers, smuggle delerium to disreputable clients in distant lands, and plunder the fantastic treasures and incredible wealth left behind in the city.

### Background

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/030-02-025.queen-of-thieves.webp#center)

Drakkenheim is a haven for criminals, deserters, and fugitives. The ever-present dangers of the dark city make it the perfect place to hide for someone on the wrong side of the law with nothing left to lose. Opportunities for plunder abound within this new frontier for banditry. Many more ply their trade raiding the supply caravans making their way to Emberwood Village. Sly cutthroats know that simply taking the spoils from a weakened but successful adventuring party at swordpoint makes for a highly profitable enterprise, and a far less risky one to boot!

When the Hooded Lanterns arrived in Drakkenheim a few years ago, they resolved to restore order. Presenting a united front against the fractious outlaws, the Hooded Lanterns met with early success in driving out the more violent and bloodthirsty among them. Then, an enigmatic figure emerged. This self-proclaimed "Queen of Thieves" used assassination, trickery, intimidation, and guile to reshape the disparate gangs into a budding criminal empire. Her plots have sabotaged many important Hooded Lanterns operations, and the Lord Commander believes the Queen of Thieves blackmailed several of his important backers into withdrawing their support.

![The Queen of Thieves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/031-02-026.queen-of-thieves.webp#center)

More importantly, the Queen of Thieves has established a general truce between the various bandit leaders occupying the city to share territory, resources, and contacts. In exchange, every gang must pay a regular tribute in gold and plunder to the Queen of Thieves. Those who don't become a target for all the others, while loyal and successful scoundrels enjoy extra benefits and kickbacks. Though the Queen of Thieves is now infamous for her schemes and skill, her web of black market smugglers secures her rule over the underworld. Her agents funnel treasures and delerium purloined from Drakkenheim to skilled fences and unscrupulous merchants in the world beyond. This ensures ample gold and booze flow back into Drakkenheim to keep her army of scoundrels happy and well-supplied.

#### Strongholds

##### The Skull & Sword Taphouse

The Skull & Sword Taphouse in Emberwood Village is a favoured haunt for many outlaws, and the best place to find [Blackjack Mel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md). This location is detailed in Chapter 4: Emberwood Village

##### Buckledown Row

In Drakkenheim itself, the gangs often meet in several run-down pubs along this dingy street. The sewers beneath connect to a series of smugglers' tunnels that lead to the underground stronghold where the Queen of Thieves holds court. Though the way is littered with deadly traps, it leads nowhere—a cruel joke the Queen of Thieves plays upon would-be hunters.

##### The Court of Thieves

Only the Queen of Thieves' most trusted agents know the true location of her personal lair. See the Faction Strongholds chapter for details.

## Roleplaying Characteristics

### Symbol

The Queen of Thieves has taken the Queen of Diamonds as her personal calling card. Her colour is red. The individual gangs wear their own colours and symbols.

### Personality Traits

- We're willing to lie, cheat, steal, threaten, and even kill to get what we want.  
- You can't trust anyone, but you can trust their greed Everyone's got a price.  
- We get even whenever someone crosses us.  

### Ideals

- We're outcasts and outlaws. The laws written by nobles and priests turned us into criminals. We're glad the old world is falling apart. It never did right by us anyways.  
- Anything can be yours if you're strong enough or smart enough to take it.  
- Always stay one step ahead of the game. There's no heroes here. If you won't do what it takes to survive, you're as good as dead.  

### Bonds

- You came to the wrong neighbourhood, friend. We rule this city now!  
- We must pay tribute to the Queen of Thieves and respect the general truce between all the outlaws in Drakkenheim. Everyone else is fair game!  
- A favour, a secret, or a good contact can be just as valuable as money to the right person.  

### Flaws

- Take any chance you get to indulge your vices. After all, it might be the last time you get to enjoy it!  
- Always look out for yourself. There's no loyalty amongst thieves. When the chips are down, it's everyone for themselves.  
- Whatever it is, wherever it came from, however we get it, whoever wants it - we don't care. If someone wants to pay for it, that means money for us!  

> [!quote] A quote from Pluto Jackson  
> 
> You won't know she is there unless she wants you to. She is not to be trusted and never underestimated. The most dangerous royalty I've ever met.

### Objectives

The Queen of Thieves dreams of building an influential and powerful criminal empire forged in the anarchy and lawlessness of the ruins, while conspiring to sabotage the other factions' operations at every turn. However, she does have her eyes on one special prize.

#### Transform Drakkenheim into an Outlaw's Haven

The Queen's Men see no reason for Drakkenheim to change. As it is, the city is a bandit's paradise. They scour the ruins for treasure, delerium, and lost magic items to sell to the highest bidder on the black market. Most outlaws don't have any loftier goals, but the Queen of Thieves wants to expand her criminal empire.

However, other factions are trying to gain ground in Drakkenheim. Driving them off isn't a simple matter, either. Several of these new rivals are also potential customers: the Amethyst Academy pays top dollar for delerium. The pilgrims flooding into the city to join the Followers of the Falling Fire are easy pickings for shakedown and robbery as well.

Others pose a more existential risk to the Queen of Thieves. If she pushes too hard against the Hooded Lanterns or the Silver Order, a much more aggressive military crackdown could ensue. To preserve the delicate balance, the Queen of Thieves has resolved to deceive, blackmail, exploit, and outwit the other factions, but not to destroy them—that would be bad for business! Therefore, she aims to disrupt and sabotage the other factions' goals. Perhaps she might even install a puppet on the throne of Westemär!

#### Obtain the Crown of Westemär

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe

> Stealing it would be the crowning achievement for a Queen of Thieves, don't you think?

This objective is only known to the most trusted associates of the Queen of Thieves. Most Queen's Men don't know they are working towards this goal. The [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) is more than just a symbol of royal authority: it is a powerful artefact in its own right that may grant several [wishes](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) to whomever wears it. There is no greater prize to the Queen of Thieves, and she wants to steal the crown so she may use its power for herself. While the Queen of Thieves has personal desires for this power, the Crown is also an effective trump card in securing control of Drakkenheim. Having the ability to make wishes is a massive deterrent for anyone who would move against her, cementing her power over the ruined city. All reliable signs indicate the crown is lost in Castle Drakken, but that's not the only complication. In order to attune to the Crown of Westemär to use its powers, one must also possess all six *Seals of Drakkenheim*.

### Key Figures

The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) is the criminal overlord of Drakkenheim. She doesn't trust any of her underlings as far as she could throw them, but [Blackjack Mel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) has proven a capable toadie and serves as faction lieutenant.

#### The Queen of Thieves

> [!quote] A quote from The Queen of Thieves.  
> 
> Who I am is not as important as what I am. I am quicker than thought, more silent than contemplation, more slippery than a fading memory, and more unshakable than a guilty conscience. I deal in secrets and mendacity as lesser thieves deal in coins and larceny. I can fulfil your wildest dreams, or I can be your worst nightmare.

The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) is a scheming mastermind who controls the Drakkenheim underworld. She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.

- **Personality Trait.** I am never caught unprepared, and have contingencies for my contingencies. I speak with rakish confidence while casually exposing everything I know about others, and flaunt my ability to be anybody or anywhere.  
- **Ideal.** I indulge in playing mind games and manipulating people with the promise of profit. Instead of spilling blood, I spill secrets. My enemies are worthless as corpses. When I have to steal lives, I spend them dearly first.  
- **Bond.** Law is powerless in the chaos of the ruins. As long as anarchy reigns, so shall I.  
- **Flaw.** Anyone who trusts me is a terrible fool. Double-crossing is my nature. I expect everyone to betray me, and I'll relish the opportunity to defeat them when they try.  

Few amongst the Queen's Men have met the Queen of Thieves in person, and even fewer have attended the Court of Thieves. Most only know if they get a note attached to a Queen of Diamonds playing card, you better do what it says.

#### Who is the Queen of Thieves?

The true power of the Queen of Thieves is her apparent anonymity. Once her true identity is revealed, she is effectively defeated. In this regard, it's important to separate the "persona" that is the Queen of Thieves from the actual *person* behind her. While this book includes one possible suggestion, you may decide the true identity of the Queen of Thieves in your campaign, and decide her true motivations for yourself. You might choose one of the missing heirs to the monarchy, or a long-lost friend or relative connected to one of your player characters. The Queen of Thieves does not disclose her identity readily, but foreshadowing various possibilities with uncanny remarks and subtle hints makes the final reveal that much more dramatic!

In the original *Dungeons of Drakkenheim* campaign, the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) was none other than **Katarina von Kessel**, one of the lost scions of House von Kessel. Unfortunately for her, she is an arcane spellcaster. Under the Edicts of Lumen, she cannot inherit the throne.

An "incident" involving an upstart wizard resulted in her sister, Eliza, being banished to the Abyss. Unwilling to accept her sister's death, Katarina von Kessel fled the Amethyst Academy and travelled the world to find a way to bring her sister back. In the process, she learned to weave her proclivities for enchantment and illusion magic with her noble-born fascination for swordplay and scheming. Eventually, she hatched a plan to return to Drakkenheim under a false identity and claim her birthright. She does not want to be used as a pawn of the Amethyst Academy or the nobility. She wants to do things *her way*, and does not believe such organizations have *her* best interests in mind—nor the interests of the common folk, for that matter. Katarina von Kessel wants to obtain the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) and use its power to restore her lost sister's life, then erase all public knowledge of her magical abilities so she may rule Westemär legitimately. She hasn't yet decided on her last wish, however.

#### Blackjack Mel

Blackjack Mel is a human [scoundrel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md). He is a short and scrawny man in his late thirties with a funny looking but clean-shaven mug and greasy slicked-back hair. He wears a black padded jacket and buckled slacks that appear distinguished at first glance, but are actually quite shabby and worn.

- **Personality Trait.** I can always make a deal with the right angle, I just gotta pitch it the right way. I don't give up when the mark doesn't take the bait, just try something new!  
- **Ideal.** We're all in this for ourselves. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.  
- **Bond.** Listen, I got some close connections with some powerful people. You wanna meet the Queen of Thieves? Stick with me. We'll go places together. Just uh, watch out you don't piss anyone off, okay?  
- **Flaw.** I'm a compulsive liar, so what? Yeah, sometimes even I get confused by my own lies, but the truth can always do with a little exaggeration, it makes life more interesting!  

#### Outlaws and Scoundrels

The Queen of Thieves upholds a general truce between a hundred individual gangs of brigands. Each outfit holds a claim to its own territory within the ruins that is their exclusive right to plunder. In return, each must pay a share to the Queen of Thieves. They must also heed her summons, which takes the form of a playing card showing the Queen of Diamonds.

She arbitrates disputes and enforces dissent in a ruthlessly efficient manner. Ultimately, the gangs are disposable pawns to the Queen of Thieves, and she *doesn't care* if the player characters get into fights with them.

Below are a few of the most prominent gangs that work under the Queen of Thieves. Feel free to expand or use these as you see fit to help flesh out the myriad outlaws encountered in the city:

#### Pins & Clubs

The Pins & Clubs are general ruffians. They often have iconic colourful mohawks or other wild coloured hairstyles. They wear a lot of spikes and chains and notoriously break the legs of people who cross them.

##### Leader

Leon The Swine, a scrawny middle aged [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) with a scar over his left eye and a mohawk. He carries a saber and a dagger, and chains hang from his leather vest and black trousers.

##### Symbol

A club logo from a card deck with several pins sticking out of it.

##### Quote

"If ya don't like the way they looked at ya, if they seem too pompous, too arrogant, too wise, or too righteous, you club them down and let them know where they really stand."

#### Rose & Thorns

This group is known for their confidence. They often are known for using daggers, spears, and shortswords and always have high quality leather armour and steel-toed spiked boots. A lot of the most well known members of this gang are a group of women renowned amongst the thieves as the Bouquet, led by the unwavering Rose Carver.

##### Leader

Rose Carver, a striking red-haired [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) with piercing eyes and studded leather armour. She has a belt filled with daggers, and steel-tipped boots with several spikes on the toes.

##### Symbol

A thorn covered rose.

##### Quote

"All beautiful things have their sharp edges. Let's show them ours!"

#### The Wounded Hearts

The Wounded Hearts use cunning, deceit, and charm to get what they want. They are masters of swindling, scheming, and double crossing. Nowhere else will you find better liars. They often wear elegant noble's garb and act stuck up, as if they deem themselves superior to the other gangs.

##### Leader

Christain Lament, a tall blonde elven [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md). He has blue eyes and wears a flowing cape and black noble's clothing with gold filigree. He carries a rapier and daggers.

##### Symbol

A heart with a blade through it.

##### Quote

"Chivalry and cordiality will get you far in this world. Kindness is the great mask of all evils."

#### The Howlin' Dogs

These bandits are all about intimidation. They have size - usually only the strongest get into this gang. They often wear vests and very little else, letting their muscles speak for themselves. They often carry axes or greatswords. Many of them dual wield. They are rude, mean, and ferocious. If you see one looking at you, it's best to look away.

##### Leader

Baskerville, a large grey-skinned half-orc [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) with muscles bulging out of his vest. He has several piercings and carries two axes. His body is covered in various scars and wounds.

##### Symbol

A growling dog skull.

##### Quote

"Most people think they can handle a dog cornered and rabid, but they can't, they don't know how sharp those teeth can be."

#### The Catacomb Cobras

Dressed all in black, and often adorned with capes or masks, these bandits are the stealthiest of the lot. They use a lot of poisons and sleight of hand. It's more often that those who double-cross the Cobras never see them coming. A lot of mysterious deaths are assumed to be linked back to this gang.

##### Leader

Veronica Venom, a human [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) who wears a black hood and dark leather armour. She has a bandolier of poison vials and 4 daggers fastened in her belt.

##### Symbol

A snake coiled around a skull.

##### Quote

"Sometimes, if you don't pay attention, you wind up in a snake pit by simply taking a wrong turn, and those snakes don't care if you're lost, they still bite."

### Missions

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/033-02-028.dice-throw.webp#center)

#### Such a Tragic Loss

Arrange the death of [Elias Drexel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lord-commander-elias-drexel-dodk.md) and [Theodore Marshal](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight-captain-theodore-marshal-dodk.md), but make it look like it was their own mistaken folly, rather than an assassination.

#### The Queen's Gambit

Once the Queen of Thieves has assembled all six Seals of Drakkenheim, she asks the player characters to gather their best assault team. It's time to take the ultimate prize: the Queen of Thieves will seize the crown for herself!

### Boons

The Queen of Thieves provides many favours to those who serve her well.

#### Who Says Crime Doesn't Pay

The Queen of Thieves makes sure her agents are well-paid. She rewards characters with 100 gold pieces each for successful missions to the Outer City, 250 gold each for missions to the Inner City, and 1,000 gold each for missions to Castle Drakken or faction strongholds.

#### Poisons

Trusted associates of the Queen of Thieves can procure any "poisons" described in the "Core Rules" from her quartermasters. The Queen of Thieves will give characters an allowance of up to 500 gold pieces to procure these poisons before any mission.

#### Purloined Equipment

If the player characters need a mundane item for a mission, the Queen of Thieves can use her web of connections to obtain it for them. This may be any mundane item in the Core Rules. How valuable the item can be depends on how long the characters are willing to wait to get it: 100 gold pieces per day spent seeking it out, up to a maximum of three weeks (or 2,100 gold)

#### Potions and Scrolls

The Queen of Thieves can provide the party with `1d4` [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) from the enchantment and illusion school of magic, and potions that aid stealth or trickery, such as a [potion of invisibility](Mechanics/items/potion-of-invisibility.md) or a [potion of gaseous form](Mechanics/items/potion-of-gaseous-form.md). Determine these randomly from items up to very rare quality, or choose items appropriate for the mission at hand.

#### Fences

Access to smugglers and dealers of ill-gotten goods. There's many items stolen from noble houses, guild vaults, or churches that normal dealers simply won't purchase. These merchants have few scruples, and can find a buyer for almost anything.

#### Smuggler's Passages

The Queen's Men have maps of the smuggler's passages and sewers. Characters can use these maps to move through the city sewers at twice the normal speed, and make checks for random encounters while doing so with advantage.

#### Stolen Magic Items

As a reward for completing an important mission, the Queen of Thieves bestows the party with a magic item she has stolen. The Game Masters can choose this item or determine it randomly. The item can be consumable or permanent. This will be a common item for an Outer City mission, an uncommon item for the Inner City or a faction stronghold, or a rare item for a successful mission to Castle Drakken, the cathedral, or the Inscrutable Tower. As long as the items are randomly determined, there's no limit to how many times she might grant this boon.

#### Cloak and Dagger Training

The Queen of Thieves allows the characters access to her training rooms. Her trusted associates Lies & Deceit can spend time showing the players new skills and combat techniques. Each character can gain one of the following of their choice:

- **Ability Score Improvement.** The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.  
- **New Feat.** The character gains a new feat of their choice (subject to GM approval).  

#### Bandit Backup

If the player characters have a reasonable need for reinforcements during a mission, the Queen of Thieves can dispatch one of her gangs to help them out. The gang sends `1d6` [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) and a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) to help out. They demand an equal share of any loot the characters find on the mission, and a share of any payment. If all bandits are killed on the mission, the player characters will not receive this boon again. If circumstances with other factions escalate into open conflict, the Queen of Thieves might dispatch `1d4` of her [assassins](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md), [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md), or [gladiators](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) to join the characters.

#### Informants

The Queen of Thieves has a wealth of spies and informants. The player characters can ask her to spy on or investigate a location, character, or event. She can provide a clue or details on that location. Her information is reliable, but not always complete.

However, the Queen of Thieves always uses her discretion and judgement in giving out this information, and she's cautious to reveal anything that could be used against her or be used to predict her own plans. She knows the value of revealing information at the right moment, so she's careful about sharing information she might use as blackmail later.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/034-02-029.wooden-toy.webp#center)

- She never reveals the locations of the *Seals of Drakkenheim*, even if she's sending the characters to claim one, she doesn't reveal that the item in question is a *Seal of Drakkenheim*.  
- She does not tell anyone about the powers of the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md), what she plans to do with it, or any personal information about herself. If asked, she laughs.  
- The Queen of Thieves knows the ideals, bonds, and flaws of almost any non-player character.  
- She can explain the background, objectives, and goals of the other factions, and the complications they face.  
- She can provide a clue about an alternative entrance to a location, or details about the monsters who might dwell there or the treasures hidden within.  
- She knows what happened to the royal family, but never discloses this information to the player characters.  
- Furthermore, she isn't privy to the inner workings of the Amethyst Academy, she doesn't know what's in the crater or where delerium came from, or if there is any truth to [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md)' claims.  

### Strike Teams

#### The Friendly Barmaid

Cora is a human [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) who sometimes works at the Bark and Buzzard in Emberwood Village. She's an informant for the Queen of Thieves and a notorious gossip. She likes to talk to drunk adventurers, flirt with them, and find out what they're planning.

#### Outlaw Gang

A typical gang consists of 24 (`7d6`) [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) or [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md), 2 (`1d4`) [bandit captains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md), and 4 (`1d6`) [spies](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md). Special members include:

`dice: [](03-chapter-3-factions.md#^1-special-member-s)`

| dice: 1d6 | Special Member(s) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | None |
| 2 | 7 (`2d6`) [worgs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md) |
| 3 | 4 (`1d6`) [bugbears](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear.md) |
| 4 | 2 (`1d4`) [ogres](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) |
| 5 | 1 (`1d3`) [doppelgangers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) |
| 6 | 1 [hedge mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md) |
^1-special-member-s

When called upon, the gangs do not necessarily send their entire outfit. You should determine an appropriate number of members who carry out the strike mission. They always send enough to outnumber the characters at least two to one, however.

#### Enforcers

When the Queen of Thieves needs to send a strong message, she sends a group of 4 (`1d6`) bugbear [gladiators](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) to start cracking skulls and breaking legs. They are also assigned to guard any prisoners.

#### Infiltrators

This strike team of 2 (`1d4`) [doppelgangers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) is led by one known as Thought-stealer. The Queen of Thieves herself oversees this strike team, using [telepathic bond](Mechanics/spells/rarys-telepathic-bond.md) and [scrying](Mechanics/spells/scrying.md) spells. This strike team only conducts infiltration, information gathering, and clandestine asset recovery. They're rarely used for direct attacks such as assassination or kidnapping: they are her eyes and ears.

#### Saboteurs

Lies (a tiefling [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) and her twin brother, Deceit (a tiefling [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) coordinate a strike team of 5 [scoundrels](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md). This strike team fulfils a wide variety of roles, and is sent in when the Queen of Thieves needs exceptionally skilled agents for an important mission. Occasionally, the Queen of Thieves uses [modify memory](Mechanics/spells/modify-memory.md) on members of this strike team so they can't reveal secrets about their missions when captured, or even casts [dominate person](Mechanics/spells/dominate-person.md) on one of them so she can "personally" oversee the operation.

#### Royal Assassins

This elite strike team consists of one [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) per player character. It's led by Dell Talquamar and the Boogeyman (both [assassins](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) alongside Jerry Rigz, a goblin [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) to provide logistics and magical support. This strike team is only deployed to steal a *Seal of Drakkenheim*, to take out a rival faction leader, or to destroy the player characters.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/035-02-030.blackjack-mel.webp#center)

### Schemes

#### Shakedown

The Queen of Thieves sends one of her gangs to go beat the party up after a mission in the ruins. She doesn't have them killed, but she steals their equipment and valuables.

#### Blackmail

The Queen of Thieves uses her agents and magic to discover a terrible secret about one of the player characters, or some crime or trespass they committed in the ruins. She threatens to reveal the secret if the characters don't work for her.

#### Bribery

Using the intel she has gathered, the Queen of Thieves caters to the goals of the party and offers to pay them an exorbitant sum of money (as you see fit) to buy the characters' loyalty—or at least their services.

#### Eyes and Ears

Spies tail the party and gather information on their next moves and plans, along with any factions they associate with for the next `1d4` days. If undiscovered they relay all information to the Queen of Thieves for her to use to her advantage.

#### Backstabbing

The Queen of Thieves expects the player characters will betray her. She is never surprised when this happens, and should always have a plan in mind for if the player characters' decide to double-cross her.

#### Puppetmaster

The Queen of Thieves kidnaps a faction member. Thereafter, she controls the faction agent using [dominate person](Mechanics/spells/dominate-person.md) and sends them back as a spy. If caught, the Queen of Thieves might try to create the impression that the puppet is actually a [doppelganger](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) or magical disguise, rather than a dominated person. Thanks to the Queen's [Modify Memories](Mechanics/spells/modify-memory.md) power, this faction member won't have any knowledge of what happened.

#### An Audience with the Queen

The Queen of Thieves invites the characters to the Court of Thieves to negotiate. Once they arrive, she lures them into the arena to face her gladiators, and then her favoured pet: Big Linda.

#### Captured by the Queen

The Queen of Thieves prefers taking the characters prisoner over killing them. If captured, she'll interrogate them using [suggestion](Mechanics/spells/suggestion.md) and [detect thoughts](Mechanics/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spells to learn their secrets and gain leverage over them, so she can force them to do her bidding.

#### Imposter Syndrome

The Queen of Thieves sends [doppelgangers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) disguised as the party to Emberwood Village where they cause a commotion and set fire to a building. They flaunt their false identities and make sure to tarnish the names of the characters.

#### Sabotage

The Queen of Thieves sends a strike team to sneak into a faction stronghold with explosives (perhaps a [scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [fireball](Mechanics/spells/fireball.md) or [necklace of fireballs](Mechanics/items/necklace-of-fireballs.md)) and blow up a critical resource.

#### Theft

The Queen of Thieves dispatches one of her elite strike teams to steal magic items or valuable information from the player characters or their faction allies.

#### An Offer You Can't Refuse

The Queen of Thieves secures an asset valuable to completing a character's personal quest. She uses it as a bargaining chip.
