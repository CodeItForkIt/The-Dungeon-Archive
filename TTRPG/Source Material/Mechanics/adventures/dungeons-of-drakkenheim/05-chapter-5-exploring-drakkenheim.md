# Chapter 5: Exploring Drakkenheim
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 64* 

Following an overview of the city itself, this chapter introduces the core mechanics for running urban exploration in Drakkenheim: navigating the city streets and sewers, generating random encounters, and the properties of the mysterious Haze. You'll want to refer to these mechanics throughout the campaign, alongside the appendix sections of this book that detail the rules for Contamination, Delerium, the Random Encounter Tables, and of course, the City Map.

Finally, this chapter closes with an introductory exploration adventure: a Delerium Hunt!

## City Overview

Drakkenheim was a grandiose capital city famous for its many architectural wonders. The even-handed rule of House von Kessel fostered a vibrant and industrious spirit that welcomed folk throughout the realm and beyond, and the city was an international hub for trade and culture. Nearly a hundred thousand people called Drakkenheim home, and thousands more lived in small villages and hamlets a few days travel from the city. Only a few hundred people survived the cataclysm that devastated the city, and the folk who lived in the surrounding countryside have abandoned the area for safer regions.

The recorded history of Drakkenheim stretches back about six hundred years, but a settlement and fortification have stood here since antiquity. The city was named after its founders, the now-extinct House von Drakken. Four distinct dynasties have ruled the city since, with House von Kessel claiming the throne one hundred fifty years ago.

Drakkenheim is divided into three main regions:

- **The Outer City,.** estates, suburbs, and slums surrounding the city walls.  
- **The Inner City,.** protected by the City Walls and accessible through five Gates.  
- **Castle Drakken,.** a palace and military fortification that lies atop a high crag.  

The city itself is further divided by the **Drann River**. Common parlance calls the two halves the North Ward and the South Ward.

### Streets

Five major highways lead to Drakkenheim. The roads transition into the city's main streets: King's Road, Temple Road, Shepherd's Way, Champion's Way, and College Street. Each passes through a correspondingly-named gate, and ranges from twenty to forty feet wide with broad sidewalks along either side. Wrought-iron lamp posts and sewer drains are placed throughout. They converge at Market Square. Elsewhere in the city, the common cobblestone-paved roads are twelve to eighteen feet wide. Most have a narrow two-foot wide brick sidewalk. Sidestreets are often no more than ten feet wide, and in other areas only a narrow alley separates the buildings. In the outer city slums, many roads are merely gravel-covered or raw dirt, though there are some stone-paved streets.

### Buildings

Drakkenheim is a city of stone buildings and slate spires. Many in the Inner City may be three or four storeys tall, sometimes taller. Most are tightly packed townhouses built on stone ground levels, although the upper levels are often made from wood, and boast fine glass windows and sturdy chimneys. Wealthier homes even feature indoor plumbing directly connected to the city's water system. Dozens of smaller chapel domes and spires mark distinct boroughs in the city. In contrast, the outer city is mostly a ramshackle slum consisting of crumbling tenements, wattle and daub cottages, and fieldstone shacks. However, the northern estates and the sections along major roads boast fine construction similar to that of the inner city.

### Drann River

The Drann River is roughly four hundred feet wide and flows southwest. The water is deep, slow-moving, and thoroughly contaminated. Four stone causeways span the water. Stone quays and piers surround the river within the Inner City.

#### Contaminated Water

All water in Drakkenheim is contaminated, including the Drann River. Characters who end their turn in contaminated water must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.

### City Walls

Stone masonry walls forty feet high and five to ten feet thick separate the Inner City and the Outer City, with entrance via five gates. These fortifications present a major obstacle when exploring the city: the five city gates are occupied by faction forces or monsters, and hostile [gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) attack any who scale the walls. Refer to the "Walls of Drakkenheim" in Chapter 7: Inside the Walls of Drakkenheim for details.

### Castle Drakken

Atop a high cliff on the north side of town perches Castle Drakken. The fortification and palace is described in chapter 9.

## The Haze

The Haze is magical radiation emitted by the vast concentration of delerium in Drakkenheim. It permeates the ruins and extends about two miles outside the walls.

### Effects on Characters

Creatures do not gain any benefits from finishing a long rest within the Haze.

Creatures may remain in the Haze for up to twenty-four hours before they must finish a long rest to recuperate from exposure to its eldritch energies. For each additional hour spent within the Haze beyond twenty four hours, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.

Most monsters encountered in Drakkenheim possess the *fully contaminated* trait (see Appendix A) and ignore these effects.

### Environmental Effects

At dawn, the Haze magically manifests mist throughout the ruins. Characters can see normally through the mist up to 150 feet. Vision beyond is "lightly obscured", but vision past 300 feet is totally obscured. Any mists dispersed during the day reform ten minutes later.

The mists dampen sunlight. Creatures with **sunlight sensitivity** or similar traits do not suffer these penalties during the day while within the Haze.

The mist disperses shortly after sunset, but the Haze appears as a shifting corona of octarine light shimmering over the city during the night. Floating motes and hazy particles hang over the city streets providing illumination akin to moonlight, and delerium crystals emit a bright glow to a range of five feet.

The corpses of beasts and humanoid creatures do not rot within the Haze. However, most unattended corpses left in the streets are devoured within a day by ravenous [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md). Other food and drink spoils after `2d6` days within the Haze.

### Effects on Spells

The erratic magic of the Haze disrupts many spells cast within it. Any teleportation spell cast by a creature outside the Haze targeting a creature or location within the Haze automatically fails and the spell slot is wasted. Creatures inside the Haze may teleport normally within, but any attempt to leave the Haze via teleportation fails. Telepathic communications or effects such as the [sending](Mechanics/spells/sending.md) spell transmitted from outside the Haze fail to contact a character within it, and vice-versa. Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the Haze, and those created outside the Haze can't enter it. Finally, other divination spells fail to reveal useful information about delerium, the Haze, the origins of the meteor, or any events that occurred within the Haze.

When a character attempts any of the above using a spell or other effect, they must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they take `6d6` psychic damage and become [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) with madness until they finish a long rest. During this time they speak only in gibberish. A [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell ends this effect.

[Rope trick](Mechanics/spells/rope-trick.md), [Tiny hut](Mechanics/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md) and similar spells or abilities do not provide shelter or protection from the Haze. However, characters may rest within a [magnificent mansion](Mechanics/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion.md) spell cast within the Haze.

### Deep Haze

Certain areas are so suffused by the Haze that mere exposure is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. Known as the Deep Haze, these areas have the following additional traits:

- Deep Haze is instantly recognized by a thick prismatic fog. Characters can see normally through this fog up to 60 feet. Vision beyond is "lightly obscured", but vision past 120 feet is totally obscured. If dispersed during the day, the fog reforms one minute later.  
- Characters entering the Deep Haze must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, and again for each full hour spent within. On a failed saving throw, they suffer 10 (`3d6`) "necrotic damage" and gain one level of contamination.  

The Haze map indicates which areas of the city are covered by the Deep Haze. Other locations suffused by the Deep Haze are noted in location descriptions.

### Delerium Sludge

Gargantuan delerium geodes perspire an opalescent sludge. Characters submerged in delerium sludge make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn. They take 42 (`12d6`) "necrotic damage" on a failed saving throw, and half as much on a successful one. In addition, characters who fail the saving throw gain one level of contamination.

## Navigating the Ruins

Drakkenheim behaves more like a dangerous wilderness than an urban location. Characters risk perilous random encounters with hostile monsters and mysterious magical phenomena as they traverse the ruins, but may also stumble upon delerium, lost treasures, and faction agents.

### Getting to the City

Aside from Emberwood Village, all towns and villages within one week's travel of Drakkenheim have been wholly abandoned. The nearest large cities are a three-week journey away.

Travel times from safe havens are indicated below. When travelling to the city, characters may arrive anywhere on the city outskirts.

| Origin Point | Distance | Travel Time on Foot |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Eckerman Mill | 1 mile | 20 minutes |
| Camp Dawn | 2 miles | 1 hour |
| Emberwood Village | 5 miles | 2 hours |
^origin-point-distance-travel-time-on-foot

### Urban Exploration

As the player characters traverse the ruined city, you can handle urban exploration in an abstract manner as follows:

- Using the city map, identify approximately where the characters are currently located.  
- Let the players determine what direction they want to go and choose their travel pace (see "Moving Through the Streets" below).  
- Check for random encounter each hour (see below for tables).  

It's not necessary to precisely track which streets the characters take; a rough route is sufficient. Correspondingly, navigation checks are not required. Characters can locate key adventure sites without much difficulty, as long as they have approximate directions and a general description of their destination. Instead, the random encounter tables include several situations in which the characters might make a wrong turn or become lost.

#### Moving through the Streets

Ruined buildings and maze-like streets are exceptionally "difficult terrain". How fast characters can move on foot depends on their priority:

- **Fast.** At this pace, characters advance one mile per hour. They take the most direct route to their destination and move openly on major streets. Characters cannot use stealth, and make [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) checks with disadvantage. When checking for random encounters (see "Random Encounters" later in this chapter), each character rolls twice and takes the lower result.  
- **Normal.** At this pace, characters advance one-half mile per hour. They proceed carefully through the ruins staying vigilant for threats and landmarks. Characters cannot use stealth, but may make [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) and [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) checks with advantage.  
- **Slow.** At this pace, characters advance one-quarter mile per hour to evade hostile threats. They sneak down back alleys and avoid major streets. Characters may use [stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth), and make [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) checks normally.  

#### Searching the Ruins

Use these guidelines whenever the characters deliberately search for something in the ruins, such as scavenged supplies, lost treasures, unknown locations, a hidden foe, or a safe place to rest. Conducting a good search takes at least one hour; during which the characters may survey an area with up to a ¼ mile diameter. After one hour of searching, each character makes an [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) or Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check (DC 10 for the Outer City, DC 15 for the Inner City). Exceeding the DC by 5 or more grants an additional success. Whether or not the characters find anything is determined by the total number of successes:

- **3 or more successes.** The party finds what they are looking for if it can be found within the search area, otherwise, they conclusively rule out any possibility that what they were seeking was in the area of their search.  
- **2 or more failed checks.** The characters stumble into a Random Encounter, but if they still had enough successes, they also find whatever they sought.  

If your party is larger or smaller than four characters, increase or decrease the number of required successes proportionately. Alternatively, characters might use special skills when searching for something specific:

- [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana). Delerium deposits or magical phenomena.  
- [Cartographer's Tools](Mechanics/items/cartographers-tools.md). Searching an area the characters have visited at least once before themselves, or for which they have a map.  
- [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History). Specific and notable monuments, buildings, or residences.  
- [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature). Exploring natural environments such as Queen's Park.  
- [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival). Tracking monsters or people.  
- [Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth) and [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) checks do not contribute to successes, but may be used to evade or detect hostile threats while the characters search the ruins.  

#### Finding Delerium Deposits

When characters seek out delerium by **Searching the Ruins** (described above), success requires a sucessful Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check with a DC indicated by the table below. A check result which exceeds the DC by 5 or more grants an additional success.

**Outer City Delerium Deposits (DC 15)**

| Number of Successes | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| 2 success or fewer | Nothing |
| 3 successes | 10 (`3d6`) delerium chips worth 10 gp each |
| 4 success | 3 (`1d6`) delerium fragments worth 100 gold each |
| 5 or more successes | 1 delerium shard worth 500 gp |
^outer-city-delerium-deposits-dc-15

**Inner City Delerium Deposits (DC 20)**

| Number of Successes | Result |
|---------------------|--------|
| 1 success or fewer | Nothing |
| 2 successes | 10 (`3d6`) delerium chips worth 10 gp each |
| 3 successes | 7 (`2d6`) delerium fragments worth 100 gold each |
| 4 successes | 3 (`1d6`) delerium shards worth 500 gp |
| 5 or more successes | 1 delerium crystal worth 1,000 gp |
^inner-city-delerium-deposits-dc-20

Results are cumulative, so a group that makes four successes finds `3d6` delerium chips and `1d6` fragments. As normal, generate a random encounter if characters have two or more failed check results while searching for delerium.

Characters searching within a quarter mile of the Crater's Edge receive one automatic additional success due to the rich quantities of delerium found in this exceptionally dangerous region.

#### Drakkenheim Sewers

The Drakkenheim sewers were a sophisticated engineering marvel. The system combined underground gravity-based aqueducts and drainage canals with carefully placed locks and floodgates to deliver clean and fresh water to the city population and draw away the massive quantities of sewage and wastewater. Major canals run under the city streets, and can be accessed from the surface by numerous maintenance hatches.

After over a decade of disuse, most tunnels are flooded with contaminated water and many other passages have collapsed. Other sections are now monster lairs. As a result, travelling in the sewers is extraordinarily hazardous and ill-advised. However, characters might consider taking the sewers to locate a route under the city walls, or to gain access to hidden underground dungeons such as the cistern (see chapter 7) or the Court of Thieves (see chapter 8).

##### Sewer Navigation

Handle sewer navigation abstractly using the same mechanics for navigating the streets above, except characters move at half their normal pace through the twisting tunnels. Sewer passages and access points could be almost anywhere in the city, so use the surface map as an approximate guide to track the character's progress. In addition, after each hour spent in the sewers characters must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination from contact with sewer water.

##### Searching the Sewers

Just as characters may search the streets, they might search the sewers for hidden entrances to some adventure sites. Other secret locations may be found in this manner. A DC 20 check result is needed for success when searching the sewer passages.

#### Other Exploration Activities

##### Taking a Rest

Before taking a short rest in the ruins, characters may spend one hour locating a safe spot or hiding their campsite. If they do, don't check for random encounters during their rest. Note that the Haze (described above) prevents characters from benefiting from a long rest in the city. Characters who attempt to do so anyways check for random encounters each hour.

##### Flying

Flying characters may soar across the city rapidly. At your discretion, they may risk hostile attention from the [gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) defending the walls or the [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) inhabiting the Inner City.

##### Vehicles

Land vehicles are largely impractical in the ruins, although characters could use a boat to travel via the river normally (though at your discretion characters may risk attack from aquatic or sewer-dwelling monsters!) Characters moving with a land vehicle or portaging a water vehicle travel ¼ mile per hour. Land and water vehicles can't be hidden without magic, but individual characters might be able to use stealth.

##### Finding Sustenance

Finding suitable sustenance within Drakkenheim is difficult since most food and water within the city is either spoiled or contaminated. Instead, characters should bring their own supply of food and water from outside the city. Nevertheless, a character who eats or drinks anything found in Drakkenheim that has not been magically purified makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they gain one level of contamination.

#### A Combined Approach

Drakkenheim is dangerous and unpredictable. There is no such thing as a foolproof plan for safely exploring the ruins. Nevertheless, characters using special resources, spells, magic items, or with a very inventive plan might greatly improve their navigation. For example, characters could use spells such as [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) and [pass without trace](Mechanics/spells/pass-without-trace.md) together to travel quickly while remaining unseen, or perhaps [water walk](Mechanics/spells/water-walk.md) helps characters move over the river. If they aren't expending resources, you should call for a few difficult skill checks. On a failure, they stumble into a difficult random encounter with extra complications.

#### Escaping the Ruins

Characters must use their resources carefully while exploring Drakkenheim, as there is always a chance they'll face a random encounter or two when *leaving* the ruins as well. At some point during their adventures, characters might be heavily wounded and out of resources deep in the city ruins. As they stagger back to Emberwood Village, they roll up a difficult random encounter. This could be the one that ends it for them! Be lenient the first time this happens, but merciless the second.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/043-04-002.entering-the-sewers.webp#center)

## Random Encounters

Dangerous monsters lurk everywhere in Drakkenheim.

While characters navigate the ruins, ask each player to roll ``...

- For each hour spent exploring the city (as directed above)  
- Any time you feel the players are being indecisive or idle in a dangerous environment  
- Whenever the players are having an easy time and you need to shake things up  
- When directed by specific circumstances described within an adventure site  

There is an encounter if *any* player rolls a natural one. Consult the random encounter tables below to determine what the characters encounter based on their location in the city. Some locations have their own unique random encounter tables.

You may wish to invent additional complications to the encounter for each additional one rolled, such as an ambush, additional monsters, unfavourable terrain, or erratic magical effects.

Conversely, rolling a natural 20 might add a bit of good fortune for the players, such as an opportunity to get the drop on foes or avoid them, a delerium deposit, monsters carrying treasure or a magic item, nearby allies who can help, or other advantageous circumstances for the characters.

### If every player rolls a one

What's the worst that can happen? It happens!

Finally, you can adjust the die size rolled when players check for random encounters, such as using a `1d10` or even `1d6`. The odds of a random encounter happening increase with lower die sizes, so this is ideal if you have a smaller group or want the characters to face more random encounters.

### Random Encounter Descriptions

#### Academy Surveyor

An Amethyst Academy [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) and `1d4` [hedge mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md) apprentices are conducting research in the ruins.

#### Angry Furniture

2 (`1d4`) [mimics](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md) are disguised as perfectly normal pieces of furniture in a nearby house.

#### Chimera Nest

A [chimera](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) is nesting in a tall spire. Aggressive and territorial, it swoops down to rip apart any who wander around its turf.

#### Cleaning Cube

A [gelatinous cube](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md) awaits down a narrow corridor in the sewers. It stays completely still until a creature enters its space.

#### Crimson Countess

The [Crimson Countess](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/crimson-countess-dodk.md) hunts above with a retinue of 5 (`2d4`) [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md).

#### Dozing Hulk

A single [haze hulk](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) lays sleeping across the narrow road. Squeezing past without waking it may prove difficult, but it clutches a delerium shard in its hand.

#### Deep Ones

10 (`3d6`) [aquatic delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) and 1 [chuul](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/chuul.md) occupy a sewer junction or are emerging from a sewer exit.

#### Double Trouble

Roll twice, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. If two groups of monsters or NPCs are encountered, they're fighting each other.

#### Drowned Dead

A one-hundred-foot long corridor in the sewers is completely flooded. The tunnel has 10 (`3d6`) [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) floating in it that appear lifeless unless attacked or until characters are halfway down the tunnel. The undead attempt to hold characters in place until they drown.

#### Executioner's Summons

The characters stumble into Slaughterstone Square.

#### Fallen Heroes

5 (`2d4`) [haze wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) are all that remains of this former adventuring party. They believe any living humanoids they encounter are mutated monsters.

#### Garmyr Hunters

10 (`3d6`) [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) leading `1d4` [worgs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/worg.md) are stalking the streets for fresh meat. They are on keen lookout and watch for any signs of movement. Double the number encountered in the Inner City.

#### Garmyr Ravagers

7 (`2d6`) [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) with 2 (`1d4`) [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md) are rampaging through the streets, howling loudly and starting fires.

#### Ghost Lights

2 (`1d4`) [will-o-wisps](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) attempt to lure passing characters towards a mirage of treasure or delerium in the Haze. In the inner city, there are `2d6` wisps instead.

#### Gibbering Flesh

The walls here are covered in thick fleshy growths, parts of the walls, streets, and rubble have grown eyes and mouths that break away and form 2 (`1d4`) [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md). In the Inner City, it has become a [protean abomination](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/protean-abomination-dodk.md).

#### Gloaming Ray

A [cloaker](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/cloaker.md) flies through the dark rooftops above looking for prey.

#### Going in Circles

The characters lose their position and get lost. They no longer know where they are anymore or what direction they are facing. They must wander the city streets for the next `1d4` hours, after which they regain their original position. Check for random encounters as normal each hour. A random encounter could result in circumstances where the characters no longer become lost.

#### Harpy Flock

A pack of 10 (`3d6`) [harpies](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) flies overhead surveying the ground for anything worth hunting. They perch on rooftops and watch the streets below, trying to lure wandering characters up to the roofs to push them off to their deaths

#### Hateful Dead

A lone [haze wight](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) marches with 10 (`3d6`) [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md). It commands its minions to attack any living creature they find, and raises any nearby corpses as reinforcements. Add `1d4` additional [haze wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-wight-dodk.md) when encountered in the Inner City.

#### Haze Haunt

A [warp witch](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warp-witch-dodk.md) moans and wails in the nearby building, scornfully mourning its miserable existence as it tries to remember its past. Add an additional `1d4` [warp witches](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/warp-witch-dodk.md) when encountered in the Inner City.

#### Hooded Lantern Patrol

5 (`2d4`) [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) led by an [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) are on a recon mission. If the characters are in trouble they step in to help them, but then demand the characters turn over half of whatever plunder they've found in the ruins, citing their authority under the "law" of Westemär and that "scavenging" in the ruins is technically prohibited without the assent of the Lord Commander.

#### Horribly Lost

The characters are badly turned around and become hopelessly lost in the ruins. They no longer know where they are anymore or what direction they are facing. They wander the city streets indefinitely, checking for random encounters as normal each hour. They don't regain their bearings unless the circumstances of a random encounter lead them to clues or friendly NPCs who can help them.

#### Living Ruins

Several inanimate parts of the ruins suddenly spring to life as 2 (`1d4`) contaminated elementals. Choose whichever type is most appropriate for the area.

#### Lord of the Feast

The [Lord of the Feast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) leads a warpack of 10 (`3d6`) [garmyr](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and 2 (`2d4`) [hell hounds](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/hell-hound.md).

#### Lost Ones

10 (`3d6`) [delerium dregs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/delerium-dreg-dodk.md) wander the streets ahead. They sorrowfully mutter nonsensical gibberish, but wail and screech when they encounter humanoids. Add 2 (`1d4`) [haze hulks](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/haze-hulk-dodk.md) when encountered in the Inner City.

#### Lurking Wraiths

2 (`1d4`) [arcane wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/arcane-wraith-dodk.md) flutter about seeking erratic magic, and fixate on whichever character is carrying the most delerium or magic items.

#### Menacing Manticore

A [manticore](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) circles overhead looking for an easy meal. If it spots the characters, it swoops in to attack the most vulnerable member. It flies off towards the inner city if reduced to less than half its hit points. Manticores in the Inner City may hunt in packs of 5 (`2d4`).

#### Old Alchemist's Shop

A decrepit alchemist's shop that reeks of a chemical odor stands on a street corner. A pool of spilled chemicals has become an aggressive [ochre jelly](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md). In the Inner City, 2 (`1d4`) [black puddings](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) are encountered instead.

#### Overgrown Ruin

Strange alien plants and oddly-shaped vines creep up a crumbling ruin. A [shambling mound](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/shambling-mound.md) and 2 (`1d4`) [hypnotic eldritch blossoms](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/hypnotic-eldritch-blossom-dodk.md) grow in the tangled mass.

#### Phase Webs

Strange webs cover this section of the ruins and fill nearby buildings - some even span the streets themselves. 2 (`1d4`) [phase spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/phase-spider.md) resting in the dark corners come to investigate any disturbance of their webs. The webs are especially thick in regions of the Inner City, where there are 7 (`2d6`) [spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/phase-spider.md) instead.

#### Pilgrims of the Falling Fire

A group of 10 (`3d6`) [cultists](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) led by a [cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) and a [berserker](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) are heading towards the crater.

#### Queen's Men Looters

7 (`2d6`) [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) led by a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) are hoping for easy pickings. The bandits try to hide from the players until they appear wounded or in need of a rest, so canny characters might spot them before this happens.

#### Questing Knight

A Silver Order [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) on a [warhorse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) with a retinue of 7 (`2d6`) [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) are searching for lost relics and holy sites in the ruins.

#### Ratling Raiders

A [ratling](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) [warlock of the rat god](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/warlock-of-the-rat-god-dodk.md) leads a great horde of 21 (`6d6`) [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md).

#### Ratling Scavengers

10 (`3d6`) [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) hide down a nearby alley or passage awaiting unsuspecting prey.

#### Rival Adventurers

Characters encounter a group of rival adventurers (see chapter 2).

#### Run out of Town

Characters get turned around badly, and arrive at the nearest edge of town.

#### Sewer Monster

An [otyugh](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/otyugh.md) feasting on offal lurks near a sewer access point.

#### Shadows of Drakkenheim

5 (`2d4`) [shadows](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) slowly follow the characters. They try to remain hidden and follow the party until one of the player characters is more than ten feet away from the others, then the shadows strike in an attempt to overwhelm the straggler. An [arcane wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/arcane-wraith-dodk.md) leads these shadows when encountered in the Inner City.

#### Shambling Husks

7 (`2d6`) [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) stumble and shuffle around the streets. In this unsettling gait, they play out scenes of their former everyday lives.

#### Stalking Vermin

14 (`4d6`) [ratlings](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) and 5 (`2d4`) [ratling guttersnipes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/ratling-dodk.md) have set up an ambush. These ratlings use bait to lure prey towards a dead-end street or sewer passage where the guttersnipes lurk on high ground to snipe their quarry with ranged attacks.

#### Troll Traveller

A [troll](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/troll.md) is heading through the ruins to join the trolls at King's Gate. He wears a large pack containing raw contaminated meat, a tankard of rancid ale, 11 (`2d10`) gold, and a few sets of tools and trinkets. If encountered near a bridge in the Inner City, there are 3 trolls instead.

#### Uninvited Guests

The characters arrive at the nearest city gate.

#### Wandered into the Garden

The characters arrive at the nearest edge of Queen's Park Garden.

#### Watching Gargoyles

2 (`1d4`) [wall gargoyles](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) roaming overhead swoop down to attack. If encountered in the Inner City, there are 7 (`2d6`) instead.

#### Wrong Turn

The characters find themselves back where they started an hour ago. I guess you took a wrong turn somewhere?

## Delerium Hunt

In this short introduction to exploring Drakkenheim, player characters search the ruins for delerium and other plunder they can sell in Emberwood Village. Along the way, they'll face a few random encounters in the ruins against monsters, rival adventurers, and faction patrols.

### Adventure Hook

#### Prospecting and Plunder

This fundamental hook is simple: the characters head into the Outer City Ruins on their own initiative to seek out whatever treasure and delerium they can find. Allow characters to take the reigns and plan their route. If for some reason characters don't think to do this on their own, a friendly NPC contact in Emberwood Village or even a faction lieutenant suggests the characters experience the ruins firsthand and prove they can survive the dangers there. It's risky, but there's a chance to make good money!

### Events

Use the guidelines throughout this chapter as characters explore the ruins. Finding a delerium deposit in the Cratered Street requires characters successfully search the ruins once as described above. Check for random encounters normally, but use these events along the way:

### Approaching Drakkenheim

If this is the first time the characters are venturing into Drakkenheim, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Nestled within a pine-covered valley, Drakkenheim is a walled metropolis that straddles the wide and sluggish Drann River. A high rocky hill rises above the city, upon which perches Castle Drakken. Below the imposing fortress, cobblestone streets weave around densely-packed stone buildings and slate-shingle spires. The city spills from the outer walls into a ruined urban sprawl.
> 
> The great dome of Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral stands prominently southwest of the castle. At the heart of the city lies the Cosmological Clocktower of Market Square, and to the northwest is the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy. The soaring obsidian-glass building is broken in half at the middle, but the top still hovers above in defiance of gravity.
> 
> Four bridges reach across the Drann River like desperate limbs; one is covered in massive stone statues of the heroes of old, and another lurches under the weight of the ramshackle homes and other buildings constructed upon its length.
> 
> Billowing clouds of midnight purple and dusky violet mask the sky overhead, casting the city in a dismal gloom. In the rare moments where the clouds part, stray sunbeams scornfully shine upon the city. There hasn't been a clear day in Drakkenheim in fifteen years.
^24f

#### Entering the Ruins

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mist-shrouded countryside gives way to crumbling buildings and twisting mud-filled streets. Entering the desolate city ruins, you pass the bloated corpse of a long-dead horse. The smell of ozone fills the cold air as you walk through the tattered rubble of the Outer City. Once in a while you hear a barking dog, then perhaps a scream carried on the wind.
^251

- If the player characters trigger a random encounter, instead of rolling on the Outer City table, use the Ratling Scavengers or Lost Ones results.  

#### Cratered Street

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This blasted street is filled with small craters.
> 
> Tiny crystals glow with prismatic light within each.
^253

- Characters find this location once they successfully search the ruins and score two or more successful check results.  
- There are 6 [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md) stumbling aimlessly around the craters.  
- Characters can extract 10 (`3d6`) delerium chips worth 10 gp each and 3 (`1d6`) delerium fragments worth 100 gp each. This takes about five to ten minutes.  

#### Disputed Claims

A group of rival adventurers arrives on the site as the characters extract the delerium fragments.

- They are a [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md), a [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), and a [hedge mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-mage-dodk.md). Tailor their identities and personalities to appropriately reflect your player characters. This opportunistic group tries to browbeat characters into giving up the claim.  
- If characters take too long deciding what to do about the [haze husks](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haze-husk-dodk.md), or take more than four hours to find the deposit, you may decide the rival adventurers have already claimed the first deposit (there are no haze husks present in this case). When the characters arrive, the rivals are extracting the delerium and gloat over the find. Characters who decide to move on to a second deposit encounter the haze husks as normal.  
- The rival adventurers have had some minor success so far. They have a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md), 35 (`10d6`) gold, `1d6` delerium chips, and their equipment.  

#### Escaping the Ruins

Once the characters have found their prize, don't forget to check for random encounters as they leave the city! Only then may they pawn their finds in Emberwood Village.

### Character Advancement

Once your characters complete their first successful Delerium Hunt, award them sufficient experience to advance them to 3rd level.

### Expeditions Onward

Take note of which faction agents the player characters interacted with during their early interactions into Emberwood Village.

Who did they get along with? Who did they impress? Who did they rub the wrong way? Whichever faction lieutenant(s) had a good rapport with your player characters approach them shortly after the characters return from their first successful expedition to the ruins. The faction lieutenant then offers the characters a mission to one of the locations detailed in chapter 6 - we recommend River or Ansom send characters to the Rat's Nest, and Nathaniel, Ophelia, or Blackjack Mel can send characters to the Chapel of Saint Brenna.

Beyond this point, the paths the characters might take are in their hands. Use the rumours, Adventure Hooks provided for each location, and the dossiers of the factions to navigate their choices through the Outer City, advancing to the Inner City, and eventually to Castle Drakken.
