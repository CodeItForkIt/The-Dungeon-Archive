# Chapter 10: The Fate of Drakkenheim
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 192* 

The player characters define their adventures in Drakkenheim, so there's no telling exactly how their story might end. Each character has a personal quest to complete, but there are two major questions that should be resolved at the end of the campaign: *What should be done about delerium? Who will rule Drakkenheim*?

## Resolving Personal Quests

When your characters finish their personal quests, they should ponder on the following:

### Find a Cure

What was the cost of the cure? Did the character discover a new spell like [siphon contamination](Mechanics/spells/siphon-contamination-dodk.md), or did they use a [wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) from the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md)?

### Claim the Throne

If successfully accomplished, the new monarch can make three [wishes](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) using the crown. What will they do with this power?

### Apocalyptic Vision

After seeing the vision at the Delerium Heart, what did the character decide to do? Why?

### Faction Aspirant

The character emerged as a mighty champion of their faction. Perhaps they should take up the mantle as the new faction leader?

### Score to Settle

What was the price of revenge?

### Arcane Secrets

This character has unlocked unimaginable arcane power. What will they do with this knowledge? What dark new spells will they discover next?

### Blighted Landscape

What discoveries did this character make? How did their knowledge help them resolve the conflicts in Drakkenheim?

### Family Matter

Was the character reunited with their loved one, or did they pay a personal price in this conflict?

### Overwhelming Debt

A debt once paid need not be entirely forgiven. What other favours and obligations might the character's debtors call in later?

### Lost Heirloom

What mysterious powers and strange properties might the heirloom have?

### Personal Pilgrimage

What is the character's place in the divine order? Did they come to save these places, or see them for the last time?

### Monster Slayer

What songs will the bards sing of this character's exploits?

## Defeated Factions

Factions can be directly defeated in myriad ways. At the very least, this requires removing its leader, routing the rank-and-file members, and driving them out of their stronghold. However, other inventive solutions are possible. Perhaps characters help the Followers of the Falling Fire convert the Knights of the Silver Order to believe the words of Lucretia Mathias by revealing the meteor's origin. Maybe they present irrefutable evidence to the Amethyst Academy that convinces the mages delerium is too dangerous to use responsibly. Working with the Queen of Thieves, characters might weave a tangled conspiracy and control the Hooded Lanterns from the shadows. How your players might accomplish such dramatic reversals is up to them to attempt and you to adjudicate!

Even in defeat, the factions still possess distant strongholds, fresh recruits, vast resources, and additional allies outside Drakkenheim. Nevertheless, retreating from Drakkenheim sends the faction reeling. Before they can return and exact vengeance, they will need at least a year to regroup, appoint new leaders, and determine a new strategy. You might decide to end the campaign in this moment of victory with the spark of future conflict on the horizon.

Alternatively, you might continue the campaign into higher levels. If you do, give characters time to make plans of their own, pursue other adventures, and simply take some well-deserved downtime first. While such adventures are beyond the scope of this book, consider the following scenarios:

- The High Paladin of the Silver Order dispatches a new crusading force to lay siege to Drakkenheim. They leverage the full military might of Elyria and seek support from any religious nobles in Westemär to form a powerful new coalition.  
- The Directorate of the Amethyst Academy sets grand designs in motion to reassert their dominance over delerium. They devise potent spells, artefacts of terrible power, and cunning manipulations to exact revenge against the player characters.  
- A mysterious figure takes up the mantle of the Queen of Thieves, weaving a larger web of intrigue. Perhaps the Queen of Thieves herself was merely an elaborate ruse for another shadowy mastermind?  
- Inspired by the martyrdom of Lucretia Mathias, a new wave of disciples and acolytes rouse the faithful into a militant pilgrimage. A new wave of religious conflict threatens to set the continent ablaze.  
- Outraged that an incomptetent nobility stood idle while the Hooded Lanterns were defeated, the people of Westemär unite under a charismatic rebel who promises a democratic future.  

## Epilogues

Below are a few possible outcomes and suggestions about how a Drakkenheim campaign may end, and the aftermath that follows. Each offers a dramatic conclusion to the campaign, and an epilogue that presents an uncertain future. Not all of these are mutually exclusive, either! Your players could devise an inventive solution that combines several different possibilities.

### Restoring the Throne

Though the world is indeed threatened by cosmic forces, these issues may seem distant and aloof compared to the pressing political turmoil that presently engulfs the continent. Whoever manages to wrest control of Drakkenheim will assume vast influence, enough to dictate the balance of power. While the Queen of Thieves plots the means to take advantage of this situation for her own gain, the Hooded Lanterns desperately hope they might locate a potential heir to the throne and secure the means to crown them. Who this heir might be is up to you to decide: consult the "Long Lost Heir" section in chapter 2 for details.

#### Proving the Claim

Finding the heir is one thing; but *proving* that the claimant has royal lineage is another. An heir might be identified by a broken locket, birthmark, signet ring, or some other document, but this must be substantiated with something from the ruins. There are three places such evidence might be found:

- The vaults of Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral.  
- The steward's archives in Castle Drakken.  
- The private office of the Queen of Thieves.  

You decide the exact nature of this evidence. It could include a detailed family bible outlining the order of succession, a royal will specificing the next heir, vials of preserved royal blood that can be used in a magic ritual to confirm relation, an unsent letter that grants trueborn status to an illegitimate child, a scandalous document that exposes infidelity, or the other half of a broken locket. Regardless, it should be something tangible and irrefutably authentic. If characters haven't yet found an heir, these documents could also reveal their identity and location.

##### Faction Support

A claimant to the throne will almost certainly need the support of two or more of the factions to secure the political and military force needed to win over the nobility. This doesn't necessarily have to be the Hooded Lanterns, but they are a safe bet.

#### Coronation

The [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md) and the *Throne of Drakkenheim* are more than just political concepts: they're also powerful magic items. However, unlocking the full abilities of these items requires the six *Seals of Drakkenheim* be used to perform a special coronation ritual in Castle Drakken (see chapter 9). Unfortunately, the corruption of the *Throne of Drakkenheim* by the Haze means that there's a good chance a potential claimant to the throne may die in the process if they aren't strong enough to survive - unless your players make cunning use of protective spells!

Technically speaking, these artefacts aren't actually *required* for a new monarch to reign over Westemär, but holding those items conclusively places a potential claimant in the seat of political power. A rightful ruler seated upon the *Throne of Drakkenheim* will be able to unite the nobility of Westemär once more, but one without them will have a much more difficult time commanding the respect and cooperation of the wider nobility.

#### New Dynasty

Elias Drexel and the Hooded Lanterns believe that restoring both Drakkenheim and the Realm of Westemär *requires* a scion of House von Kessel to sit on the *Throne of Drakkenheim*. However, observant characters may notice that at least four other families have ruled Drakkenheim prior to House von Kessel. As such, another noble house could make the claim provided they possess the wealth, political influence, and military might needed to secure power. This family then establishes a new royal dynasty to rule Westemär.

Such a task would require demonstrating *some* connection to the last dynasty (as per above), the political support of at least three factions, as well as holding the power of the royal treasures. Especially intrepid heroes might not like the idea of a monarchy at all. If your characters have ambitions to set up a new form of government, embrace it, but don't make it easy for them!

#### Queen's Castle

If the Queen of Thieves successfully obtains the [Crown of Westemär](Mechanics/items/crown-of-westemar-dodk.md), she'll use its power to cement her rule over the ruins. If you opted to portray the Queen of Thieves as Katarina von Kessel, she uses her first wish to close the dimensional rift, the second to restore the life of her lost sister, and the final to erase all knowledge of her magical abilities. She then reveals her true identity so she may legitimately rule Drakkenheim. Whether or not Katarina von Kessel is a good ruler is uncertain, but she proves a shrewd politician. Undoubtedly, her political ambitions will not stop with Westemär alone.

### Reborn Flames

The Knights of the Silver Order insist that destroying all the delerium in Drakkenheim must be done to avert an apocalypse, but whether accomplishing such a task is even possible is uncertain. Conversely, the Followers of the Falling Fire vehemently believe delerium offers the key to salvation, but this divine upheaval will require thousands make pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Both factions think they can achieve their goals by resurrecting a legendary harbinger of the Sacred Flame.

Beneath the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio lie the bones of Argonath, an ancient gold dragon. Although the wyrm has been dead for over five hundred years, Saint Vitruvio proclaimed that in the city's darkest hour, a faithful soul could cast [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md) on the dragon's remains to bring it back to life. However, a much more powerful gemstone is required for this purpose: either the *Diamond of Mount Kadath*, a priceless gem located in the royal vault of Castle Drakken, or the *pristine delerium geode* taken from the Delerium Heart in the crater.

Once resurrected, Argonath only heeds the words of one who bears all the *Relics of Saint Vitruvio*. Otherwise, he slumbers.

- [Saint Virtruvio's Phylactery](Mechanics/items/saint-vitruvios-phylactery-dodk.md), found in Saint Vitruvio's Cathedral  
- [Ignacious, the Sword of Burning Truth](Mechanics/items/ignacious-the-sword-of-burning-truth-dodk.md) sealed beneath the cathedral catacombs.  
- [Shield of the Sacred Flame](Mechanics/items/the-shield-of-sacred-flame-dodk.md) found in the royal apartments of Castle Drakken  
- [Helm of Patron Saints](Mechanics/items/helm-of-patron-saints-dodk.md) located in the crypts of Saint Selina's Monastery  
- [Sceptre of Saint Vitruvio](Mechanics/items/sceptre-of-saint-vitruvio-dodk.md), located in the Chapel of Saint Brenna  

#### Purged with Dragonfire

If resurrected by the Silver Order, Argonath helps the knights burn Drakkenheim to the ground. Destroying all the delerium within the ruins is a monumental undertaking, but just might be possible with the power of an ancient gold dragon. Argonath's flames deal radiant damage, not fire damage.

A suitable climax could see the player characters riding Argonath into the crater alongside the Knights of the Silver Order, where they battle to destroy the Delerium Heart. If they are successful, the Haze will gradually disappear over the next two decades. The change becomes evident when many monsters grow timid and the mists slowly recede. Smaller pockets of delerium continue to emerge, however, necessitating constant cleanup efforts. The Silver Order staunchly maintains control over the city until the work is done, though other factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Followers of the Falling Fire will almost certainly continue opposing their efforts. Once every trace of contamination is eradicated, people may return to Drakkenheim to rebuild. Unfortunately, unless a new monarch is firmly established in another city (see "Restoring the Throne" above), the political outcome for Westemär is grim. The nation disintegrates into a dozen warring provinces long before Drakkenheim itself is restored.

#### Darkness and Salvation

Should Argonath be resurrected by the Followers of the Falling Fire, the worshipers use the dragon to drive out the Knights of the Silver Order and the Amethyst Academy. Thereafter, Argonath keeps vigil over Drakkenheim, protecting future pilgrims who come to join the Falling Fire. Lucretia Mathias will die a few months before her 100th birthday, but before her death, she writes one final testament. It affirms the deepest shadows are yet to come, but the Sacred Flame will spark again from a moment of utter darkness.

Provided charismatic disciples such as the player characters rise to take her place and lead the Followers of the Falling Fire, the nascent religion spreads. New converts flow into Drakkenheim to take the sacrament - first hundreds, then thousands, then more. The Falling Fire continues to face intense persecution from the mainstream clergy, but the resurrection of Argonath by a group of supposed heretics shakes the foundations of the faith in the eyes of the laity. In time, millions come seeking a place in the new divine order. When these individuals die, their golden delerium soulstones are gathered in the crater. However, Drakkenheim is never truly rebuilt; the ruins come to be seen as a holy place.

The Followers of the Falling Fire do nothing to prevent new delerium formations, and so the Haze spreads unabated. The faithful stay the course as the world slowly descends into chaos over several decades. Sanctified devotees may survive within the Haze, but monsters grow great and terrible as the whole earth is swallowed by the mists. Even mighty Argonath eventually falls. When the world begins shaking apart, the final Follower of the Falling Fire completes the sacrament before a vast assemblage of golden delerium crystals containing millions of righteous souls. In that moment, Lucretia Mathias' prophecies might come to pass, or they might not. Either way, the world undergoes a new apotheosis in a brilliant corona of multicoloured light.

### Sequestered City

The Amethyst Academy wants to harness the arcane power of delerium, and believes they can contain the dangers involved. Eldrick Runeweaver has designed a monstrously powerful version of the [prismatic wall](Mechanics/spells/prismatic-wall.md) spell, one large enough to form a containment dome enclosing the entire city. This is a closely guarded secret, and he will not reveal this plan until every piece is in place.

Such a dramatic display of magical power is a major political risk for the Amethyst Academy. They won't carry out this plan without support from a new monarch of Drakkenheim, or at least with sufficient backing from whatever authority remains in Westemär. The archmages claim the barrier is the best hope for eventually restoring Drakkenheim: it will allow the Amethyst Academy to carefully extract the delerium so they can put it to proper use constructing magic items, which they will happily sell to anyone who can afford them. Once all the delerium is quarried, the Amethyst Academy claims they will lower the barrier and help rebuild the city.

The spell requires tremendous arcane power to set in motion and maintain:

- The Inscrutable Tower Nexus acts as the fulcrum of the spell. The [Inscrutable Staff](Mechanics/items/inscrutable-staff-dodk.md) is needed to reactivate and control the Nexus for this purpose.  
- Characters must install a suitable local power source in the Nexus: a *pristine delerium geode* taken from the Delerium Heart in the crater. Thereafter, a new delerium crystal must be supplied daily to maintain the spell.  
- A special arcane siphon must be installed at the Delerium Heart to channel its power to bolster the spell.  
- 8 arcane spellcasters who can cast spells of 5th level or higher must participate in the ritual. At least one must be capable of casting 9th level spells.  

Naturally of course, the player characters are called upon to enact these plans and participate in casting the spell, which might prompt a last-ditch sabotage attempt from an enemy faction. Once cast, the spell is indeed powerful enough to halt expansion of the Haze, effectively turning Drakkenheim into a greenhouse where the Amethyst Academy may harvest and study delerium at their sole discretion. Thereafter, only Academy mages and their designated allies are permitted through the barrier. A few scavengers and looters find secret tunnels and hidden means of entry, and occasionally, monsters escape via the river or underground passages. The city remains a dangerous place, but one largely quarantined within the colossal prismatic barrier. However, rather than strip-mine delerium, the Academy carefully cultivates it. The barrier remains indefinitely, because the Academy intentionally allows more delerium to grow within to maintain their supply. The Amethyst Academy uses its newfound wealth and influence to clandestinely reshape the political destiny of the continent, and possibly even unravel the Edicts of Lumen.

Nevertheless, should the prismatic barrier fall through sabotage or negligence, the results would be appropriately catastrophic. The feedback force shatters the Inscrutable Tower and causes the Haze to violently explode outward for hundreds of miles around. The volatile magic greatly accelerates the expansion of the Haze, and the world is destroyed only a few years later.

### Anarchy in Drakkenheim

![Delerium Mage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/144-09-002.wizard-portrait.webp#center)

In the midst of ongoing conflict, it's possible none rule the ruins save monsters and mayhem. Perhaps several of the plans above fail, no credible heir survives, and the player characters and factions decide that Drakkenheim is best abandoned. A new ruler might decide to establish another city as the capital of Westemär. Unless they possess both political savvy and military strength, Westemär will likely fragment into several smaller realms as a result. Indeed, this is the most likely course unless the player characters intervene, though one that unfolds over decades of intrigue, betrayal, and war.

By that time, the situation in Drakkenheim may become even more dire as the Haze grows larger and larger. In about a decade, containment will become almost impossible when more dimensional rifts and greater horrors begin to awaken within the crater. A few may callously conclude that the destruction is still centuries away, and so the Haze is a problem for future generations to inherit. Other powerful and wealthy recluses might selfishly plot to save themselves by fleeing to other worlds. Perhaps, a new generation of hopeful heroes may come together and try to save the world before it is too late.
