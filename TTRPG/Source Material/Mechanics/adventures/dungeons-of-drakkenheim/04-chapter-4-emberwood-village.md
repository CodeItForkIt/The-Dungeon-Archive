# Chapter 4: Emberwood Village
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim, p. 56* 

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A few miles south of Drakkenheim lies Emberwood Village, a humble crossroads along Champion's Way surrounded by forsaken farmsteads and dark pine forests. Many residences are abandoned and slowly deteriorating with their windows and doors nailed shut. However, the village centre is alive with activity. Conversation, laughter, and music resound from several taverns along the main thoroughfare. Amidst a bustling market square, a small crowd of adventurers, merchants, and prospectors busily traffic all manner of weapons, equipment, coins, recovered treasures, and a few strange glimmering crystals. Even the light of the Sacred Flame still glows within the modest stone chapel at the heart of town.

## Overview

This chapter details Emberwood Village, a safe haven where player characters may rest, recuperate, and resupply between their adventures in Drakkenheim. Equipment, lodgings, spellcasting services, a few magic items, and other amenities are available from the many folk dwelling in the village.

By interacting with the various townsfolk, faction agents, and other non-player characters in Emberwood Village, the player characters will discover many adventure hooks and rumours that direct them towards key locations within Drakkenheim. The taverns and inns are the perfect place to make initial contact with various faction lieutenants who use the establishments as neutral ground for meetings. Many rival adventurers can be encountered in Emberwood Village as well, ready to swap stories and stoke friendly competition.

### Emberwood Village Background

Two decades ago, Emberwood Village was little more than a farmers market, blacksmith, a pub, a small chapel and a few dozen cottages. The local businesses served the farmlands and logging camps surrounding the capital, and the town was an occasional rest stop for merchants to stop off on their way to Drakkenheim.

As the town lies some five miles south of the capital city, it was not directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows of every building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in the village [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or [deafened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened). Unfortunately, the aftermath was all the more terrible. Over the past fifteen years, the contamination in Drakkenheim has affected the countryside for miles around. The once fertile fields and dense woods are now barren and dying. Gradually, most folk gave up, departing for safer and more prosperous places. A few people remained behind, determined to hold onto their family homes and salvage their livelihoods.

Emberwood Village persisted despite the odds. After the civil war, adventurers began showing up in the town. Explorers heading towards the dark city needed a safe place to tend their wounds and rest, and so Emberwood Village gradually became a sort of boom town on a new frontier for adventure.

## Interactions

Emberwood Village is home to only about two hundred permanent residents, almost all are [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) who endured years of hardship after Drakkenheim was destroyed. However, the recent flow of coin from explorers scouring the ruins allows many to live modest or comfortable lifestyles. The common folk tend to keep their dealings with adventurers friendly but professional. They give rough-looking warriors a wide berth, but enjoy hearing news, gossip, and stories about daring exploits in the ruins. As long as interactions stay peaceful, the villagers will deal with anyone regardless of their faction allegiances. The villagers live in strange times, and are used to seeing odd-looking folk and weird magic. They can recognize delerium, severe contamination, and mutations, and encourage such individuals to seek magical aid.

### Arrival by Caravan

If the characters arrived in Emberwood Village in the company of Eren Marlowe (see "The Road to Drakkenheim"), they are paid the agreed rate of 25 gp per character. While Marlowe doesn't sell goods commonly needed by adventurers, they can offer some friendly advice about town:

- They invite characters to meet them again at the market square in the village. Marlowe will introduce characters looking for adventuring equipment to Armin Gainsbury.  
- Marlowe suggests characters visit the Bark and Buzzard if they're looking for a place to relax and get a good meal. Characters can ask the owner, Karin Alsberg, about setting them up in one of the empty cottages around town should they need accommodations.  

### A Curious Crowe

Emma Crowe, a ten-year-old red-headed and freckle-faced human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) keeps lookout from a dead tree on the way into town. She skips up to adventurous looking newcomers and introduces herself as the daughter of the local blacksmith, Tobias Crowe. She offers them a tour around Emberwood Village for a gold piece. At each location, the precocious youngster tells a story about an adventurer who once frequented the business, then gives a lighthearted account of the grisly fates they met in Drakkenheim. The tour ends at the Crowe and Sons Smithy.

### Adventuring Equipment

Most weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment described in the "Core Rules" are available in Emberwood Village. The various merchants and their wares are described in the Area Details below.

Emberwood Village relies entirely on trade for goods and supplies, since all other settlements for miles around are now abandoned and local food production has become impossible. As a result, weapons, armour, and adventuring equipment are sold for double the normal price found in the Core Rules. Food costs five times as much, and water isn't given freely. Instead, it is priced like alcohol.

Exotic equipment, vehicles, mounts, or other mundane items that cost over 500 gp are especially rare and must be brought in from outside Drakkenheim. It takes 21 (`6d6`) days to deliver such items, which cost five times the typical price.

The folk of Emberwood Village have grown accustomed to adventurers trying to haggle and swindle them. They don't give discounts or make deals, and tell adventurers who push for better prices to pay up or go elsewhere (there isn't anywhere else to go).

### Selling Treasure

Most merchants in Emberwood Village will trade or purchase found treasure, salvaged equipment, gems, or art objects at half their listed value.

### Trading Delerium

Only a few intrepid and wealthy purveyors can afford to trade in delerium. These include Aldor the Immense, Orson Fairweather, and River of the Amethyst Academy. Typically, most delerium is bought and sold for about half its listed value in Appendix D. However, some traders may offer more preferable rates for proven associates. Due to their rarity, crystals and geodes typically command their full market value.

### Lodgings

Though there are many taverns and public houses in Emberwood Village, the only actual inn is the Red Lion Hotel (see description below). However, the Alsbergs of the Bark and Buzzard tavern can make arrangements for characters to bunk in one of the abandoned homes and cottages in town.

### Magic Items and Spellcasters

A few NPCs in Emberwood Village sell a limited selection of magic items, mostly potions and scrolls:

- Aldor the Immense sells a small selection of uncommon and rare magical items, and will offer to purchase found magic items as well.  
- Flamekeeper Hanna or Old Zoya offer spellcasting services of spells up to 3rd level.  

These characters also sell expensive spell components for spells of 3rd level and lower, and occasionally have one or two components for spells of 4th or 5th level.

Characters seeking more powerful magic items, higher level spell components, or the services of higher-level spellcasters must seek assistance from the factions.

> [!quote] A quote from Sebastian Crowe  
> 
> A lot of fires happen in this town. Oh wait, none have happened since I left? That's strange.

### Law and Order

Although the Hooded Lanterns claim otherwise, there is no established law and order in Emberwood Village. Most businesses provide their own protection and security, and the villagers look out for each other. Word travels fast, though. Services, supplies, or shelter aren't available to adventurers with a violent and antagonistic reputationâ€”for any price.

Belligerent curs who disturb the peace are beaten. Those who commit robbery, fraud, and property damage are driven out of town and never welcomed back. Murderers and arsonists are executed. Crimes of any sort involving magic are punished by hanging. On the flipside, there's little the villagers can do when perpetrators aren't caught red-handed. There's no authority willing to investigate crimes or search for missing people, so the villagers must petition adventurers or the factions for help. There are no trials; the mob becomes judge and jury.

In this respect, characters who make themselves villains may be targeted by the Hooded Lanterns, the Silver Order, or even the [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) should they directly threaten the immediate safety of Emberwood Village. Alternatively, a rival adventuring party might even take up the bounty or intervene in a crisis. However, if any of the villagers are killed, no one comes to replace them.

### Making Contact with the Factions

During their first visit to Emberwood Village, characters may encounter several faction agents. Each is a key contact between the characters and the factions during their adventures in Drakkenheim:

- **Ansom.** and **Petra Lang** are human [urban rangers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) of the Hooded Lanterns. They are frequently relaying messages and leading [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) teams to the Old Watchtower, and can be encountered there most days.  
- **Blackjack Mel.** is a human [scoundrel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md) working for the Queen's Men. He can always be found at the back tables of the Skull & Sword with a bodyguard of `2d6` [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md). He's happy to talk shop with mercenaries.  
- **Nathaniel Flint.** is a human [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) of the Followers of the Falling Fire. He is regularly seen at the Hendrix Farm preparing the latest group of pilgrims for the last leg of the journey towards Drakkenheim. He uses the old barn as a meeting place for important matters.  
- **Ophelia Reed.** is a human [chaplain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/chaplain-dodk.md) of the Silver Order. She is visiting the Chapel of Saint Ardenna where Flamekeeper Hanna has granted her permission to hold meetings and discussions.  
- **River.** is a tiefling [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) of the Amethyst Academy. She can be met at the Red Lion Hotel. She rents a private suite and is often reading in the parlour, where she might chat with adventurers.  

Roleplaying traits for each of these characters are described in detail in chapter 3 but all act mostly neutral during their first encounter with the player characters. Instead, they try to size up their potential. Each explains some information about their faction, such as their ideals and general mission (see the faction dossiers in chapter 3 for more information). These NPCs might share a drink or meal with the characters, ask them if they've been to the ruins yet, or inquire about why they've come to Drakkenheim. However, they won't offer missions or quests until the characters have survived at least one expedition of their own to the ruins.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/038-map-3.01-emberwood-village-map-player.webp#gallery)

### Bark and Buzzard

Nestled amongst the residential cottages of Emberwood Village, this small one-level public house is a popular spot for locals and adventurers seeking a peaceful and laid back place to unwind. The sign hanging above the door depicts a cartoonish vulture feasting on the entrails of a bloodhound, both smiling pleasantly. The public house has a cozy and familial character: there's no proper bar, nor any walls separating the kitchen from the dining room. Instead, a few benches are arranged beside the main cask, and about a dozen round tables surround an inviting hearth. The Alsberg family has owned and maintained the establishment for a generation. Karin Alsberg and her husband, Holger (both human [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) make fine home-brewed beer known as Ember Ale, and serve hearty braised lamb stew with fresh-baked bread.

- A mug of fine ale costs 2 sp. A meal costs 1 gp.  
- The Alsbergs keep half a dozen one-room cottages in the village that they will rent to travellers. The price is 2 gold per night.  

#### Old Rattlecan

Sitting behind the Bark and Buzzard like a scarecrow, Old Rattlecan is an intelligent suit of [animated armour](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) which was found in the ruins of Drakkenheim. A mysterious magical enchantment causes it to rebuild itself when destroyed:

- Rival adventurers drinking in the Bark and Buzzard may invite player characters to "come kick the can out back". They challenge them to see which character can defeat Old Rattlecan the fastest, or who can survive the longest before being knocked out. Adding handicaps or bizarre "house rules" are popular ways to spice up the contest, such as being blindfolded, using no weapons, or taking drinks between hits.  
- Rattlecan rejuvenates after one minute when reduced to 0 hit points unless it is [disintegrated](Mechanics/spells/disintegrate.md) or [dispel magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) is cast on its remains. Everyone in town is terribly upset if this happens.  
- A creature reduced to 0 hit points by Old Rattlecan is [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) but stable and wakes up one minute later with 1 hit point.  
- Old Rattlecan can occasionally be heard making remarks to those it fights. It yells things like "Have at thee cur!", "'Tis a flesh wound!" or "Was that the best you can do?" as it seems to revel in battling any challenger.  

### Gilded Lily

This lavish two-storey building is surrounded by a veranda decorated with a swirling lily motif and painted purple. It has ornate golden glowing lanterns hanging between the veranda arches and within its curtained windows. Inside, four large golden lamps light a small stage set before rows of candlelit tables. Floral arrangements line the walls. The well-stocked bar displays wines and spirits from across the world. The Gilded Lily is owned by a human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) named Mr. Killian Vandire, but the exquisite hostess Madam Rochelle (a human [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) runs the business and organizes the nightly performance acts. The tavern is a popular place to share company, gossip, and have a few drinks, and many adventurers make their last stop here for some good memories before trudging into the dismal ruins.

- Drinks cost 5 silver: wine, spirits, and coffee only, no beer or food is served here.  

#### Open Mike Night

"Mike" was the master of ceremonies who went missing shortly after the meteor fell. One of Mike's final wishes was to open the stage to any performer for magic shows, musical numbers, poetry readings, performances, or storytelling. The Gilded Lily is willing to host any performer who wishes to take the stage and though they do not pay their acts, they do put a hat out so patrons can toss a coin to their performer if they like the show.

- Any sort of act is allowed in the Gilded Lily. Performers may tell a story, recite a poem, sing, or play an instrument. Spellcasters might put on a magic show, and even demonstrations of acrobatic or athletic skill are welcome. Player characters are invited to be as creative as they want to earn some extra coins.  
- Player characters who take to the stage may make a skill check related to their performance: [acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics), [arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana), [athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics), [history](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History), and [performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance) are all suitable ways to represent their act.  
- Characters are paid in tips: they receive an amount of gold based on their skill check result:  

|    |    |
|----|----|
| 9 or less | The character is booed off the stage, and receives no gold for their performance. If this happens three or more times, they are banned from ever performing again. |
| 10 to 14 | Characters collect `2d6` gp in coins from tips. |
| 15 to 19 | Characters earn `5d6` gp from the impressed audience |
| 20 or higher | The wonderful performance earns `10d6` gold pieces, and characters are invited to perform an encore performance. However, characters must exceed their previous check result to win further encores. |

### Skull & Sword Taphouse

This dingy saloon was converted from an old farmstead. A jawless skull impaled upon a rusty sword is embedded beside the main doors: no one knows who it was or who did them in, but it's tradition to make a macabre greeting to the skull on your way into the bar. Inside the establishment is a rowdy environment - brawls and fist fights happen daily, and several ruffians are thrown out nightly.

The Skull & Sword is a popular place for scoundrels and misfits to gather thanks to the cheap mead and liquor served here. It may very well be the best place in Emberwood Village to pick up rumours from the city, but you may want to keep a low profile hanging out around there, or be ready to draw swords for looking at someone the wrong way.

The establishment is run by a half-orc [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) named Frida Longhorn, who keeps most people in check. Despite the rough reputation of the establishment, Frida is pretty good at keeping the peace and making sure there are no killings or broken windows in her bar. Her business partner, a halfling [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) named Cuff Goldburg, is usually sitting at one of the back tables with [Blackjack Mel](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scoundrel-dodk.md). Cuff typically excuses himself when Blackjack Mel deals with mercenaries and adventurers.

The [Queen of Thieves](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/queen-of-thieves-dodk.md) bankrolls the bar, ensuring the flow of cheap booze (which is almost all stolen). While commonfolk in Emberwood Village believe the Skull & Sword is a hub for unlawful activity, most of what goes on here is above board aside from a few sketchy meetings. The real dirty deals and smuggling happen in Buckledown Row where the other factions can't easily interfere.

- A mug of cheap mead is 5 copper pieces. Brandy, rum, vodka, and gin are 1 silver.  
- Blackjack Mel is here every night, where he has a favourite spot amongst the back tables with 7 (`2d6`) [thugs](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md). He's eager to meet potential recruits in a private booth in the back corner.  

### Red Lion Hotel

Upon a small hill overlooking the village is the impressive Red Lion Hotel. Before the meteor struck it was known as Stavros Manor, home to a human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) named Kosta Stavros who served as Reeve of Emberwood Village. After narrowly avoiding destitution when Drakkenheim was destroyed, Stavros converted his home into a hotel that serves wealthy explorers, merchants, and nobles conducting business near Drakkenheim. He is an older man with a sallow face, thinning hair, and monocle, always garbed in a rich blue vest and doublet.

The three-storey manor is made of red brick. It features lion-shaped gargoyles, large glass-paned windows, and embossed wooden doors painted green. The estate includes a dozen well-appointed bedrooms, each with their own private bath and common room. A full service staff provides patrons' every need. Meals are taken in a sumptuous dining room outfitted with an impressive crystal chandelier, and drinks are served in a vast parlour furnished with fine antiques and decorated with various sculptures, paintings, and bookshelves. Each room features a great hearth and lovely views which overlook the village or the surrounding countryside.

The Reeve has abandoned his civic duties, and is now little more than another business owner in the town. However, he still lords his imagined authority and privilege over others in the village, and prefers to share wine and gossip with travellers and merchants than deal with common folk. He regards the idea of adventuring in Drakkenheim as a sort of sport. He often makes wagers on who will die first amongst any adventuring groups who visit the Red Lion Hotel.

- Kosta Stavros loves the fine arts, especially sculpture, paintings, and literature. He's assembled a vast collection of art objects recovered by adventurers from the ruins, and exchanges coin or credit towards accommodation for works in good condition.  
- [River](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) of the Amethyst Academy stays at the Red Lion Hotel. She's happy to chat, but prefers to conduct business privately. She asks any potential new associates of the Amethyst Academy to meet with her later at Eckerman Mill (see chapter 6).  
- The Ironhelm Dwarves (see Smithy on the Scar in chapter 6) keep rooms here, along with many merchants who operate in Caravan Court and one or two groups of wealthy rival adventurers.  
- Rooms are 25 gp per night and include meals.  
- Wine and liquors are sold at 100 gold per bottle.  

### Crowe and Sons Smithy

This smithy is little more than a one-level log cabin with an overhanging thatched roof covering a workbench, stone forge, anvil, and grinding wheel. Various tools hang along the walls beside several finished weapons.

Master smith Tobias Crowe (a human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) owns and operates the smithy with his son and apprentice, Peter (a [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)). Crowe is a quiet family man who stands six feet tall with fiery red hair and beard. He's often drenched in sweat and soot, and wears a greasy pair of old goggles. Crowe proudly demonstrates the high quality of his work to customers, and openly criticizes the shoddy workmanship of their existing equipment. He spends most of his days repairing broken gear, and his evenings at the Bark and Buzzard, before returning home to his wife Moira and daughters Emma and Sybil. Although he lacks the spellcasting abilities to work with delerium, he dreams of one day creating a masterpiece out of the meteoric iron found in Drakkenheim.

- Tobias Crowe sells weapons and armour at twice the price found in the Core Rules.  
- Plate armour must be made-to-order. Payment is triple the list price, paid up front, and is available in four weeks.  
- He accepts payment in coins, gems, or precious metals.  
- He pays half-price for salvaged equipment if he thinks he can repurpose or melt it down.

### Chapel of Saint Ardenna

Located at the heart of Emberwood Village is a small chapel of the Sacred Flame. The circular fieldstone building has a copper domed rooftop, thin windows set with stained glass, and simple wooden double doors. Outside is a small crematory garden and scattering plot for the ashes of the dead. Within the chapel is a bronze *brazier of the Sacred Flame*, alight with golden fire that burns all night and day. It serves as a peaceful place of quiet worship in the harsh wasteland surrounding Drakkenheim.

The chapel is maintained by Flamekeeper Hanna (a human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) and 2 (`1d4`) human [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md). Hanna is a young woman who wears a simple white and yellow frock and keeps her black hair tied in a braid. Hanna was merely an acolyte when the last Flamekeeper died several years ago, but opted to take up the position herself rather than abandon the folk of Emberwood Village. She believes the Faith of the Sacred Flame is needed here now more than ever, and offers hospitality, kindness, and prayer to any who visit the chapel.

**High Flamekeeper Ophelia Reed** of the Silver Order regularly visits the Chapel of Saint Ardenna, protected by Ser Virgil Underwood and Ser Cassandra Wyatt, two Silver Order [cavaliers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cavalier-dodk.md). Ophelia Reed has been trying to convince Flamekeeper Hanna to join the Silver Order, but thus far Hanna has kept her neutral allegiance to the folk of Emberwood Village. Still, Flamekeeper Hanna enjoys conversation with Ophelia Reed, and allows the Silver Order emissary to take shelter in the chapel and conduct meetings with adventurers here.

#### Spellcasting Services

Flamekeeper Hanna can cast cleric spells of 3rd level and lower, and knows the [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) spell and always keeps it prepared. She charges 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 150 gp for a 3rd-level spell, plus the cost of any expensive material components.

She takes payment in coins, gems, or relics. She uses the money to help fund the caravans that supply Emberwood Village with basics for the townsfolk. Flamekeeper Hanna will occasionally waive these fees to help innocent folk in dire situations, but not adventurers who went looking for treasure and trouble in Drakkenheim.

#### Spell Scrolls

Paid in advance, once per day Flamekeeper Hanna can create [spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of any cleric spell she can cast. She charges 75 gp for a 1st level *spell scroll*, 150 gp for a 2nd-level *spell scroll*, and 450 gp for a 3rd-level *spell scroll*, plus the cost of any expensive material components. There's a single exception: a *scroll* of [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md) costs 1,000 gp.

### Watchtower

This fortified stone watchtower is the tallest structure in Emberwood Village, and lies upon the road on the north edge of town. A two-storey wooden house abuts the base. Inside is a small kitchen, a mess hall, and about two dozen bunk beds. The tower has three main levels, one serving as a meeting room, another as armoury, and the final as a private chamber for the watchmaster. Outside the tower the Hooded Lanterns keep a small training yard and a modest stable large enough for six horses. Nearby, a covered wooden bridge crosses the narrow Timberwash stream and leads out of Emberwood Village towards Drakkenheim.

This location once served as the initial outpost for the Hooded Lanterns until they successfully established a base of operations within the city proper, and the remnants of a much larger military camp are scattered about the nearby field. Now, only a small detachment keeps watch in Emberwood Village.

- A small force of a dozen Hooded Lantern [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) are posted here, with one or two other squads out on patrol in the countryside.  
- Raine Highlash, an [urban ranger](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) with a predatory look about her, serves as watch captain.  
- [Ansom](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) or [Petra Lang](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/urban-ranger-dodk.md) report in here regularly at the behest of the Lord Commander, and use the outpost to meet with mercenaries and adventurers.  

> [!quote] A quote from Veo Sjena  
> 
> Warm fires, great company, home cooked meals! What more could you ask for in a city like Drakkenheim? Did I mention the home-cooked meals?!

### Shrine of the Old Gods

Seven standing stones comprise this ancient shrine that rests within a small grove of dying trees on the outskirts of town. Inscribed on each stone are the legends of primordial gods, and between them rests a stone pedestal adorned with various animal bones, plants, and candles that are lit every night. A crude old hut lies down a dirt path near the shrine, smoke billowing from a hole in the thatched roof chimney, and an odd scent of herbs wafting from within.

The hut is home to Old Zoya, an elderly human [druid](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) who tends the shrine. Many in town wrongfully refer to her as a witch, but hold a deep respect for the ornery mystic. She claims the shrine protects Emberwood Village through these dark times. Zoya holds no love for the Sacred Flame, and keeps faith for the old, true gods.

#### Spellcasting Services

Old Zoya can cast druid spells of 3rd-level and lower, and knows the [purge contamination](Mechanics/spells/purge-contamination-dodk.md) spell and always keeps it prepared. She charges 25 gp for a 1st-level spell, 50 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 150 gp a 3rd-level spell, plus the cost of any expensive material components.

She takes payment in coins, gems, or relics. She refuses to speak of what she does with the money, and grows impatient with anyone who gets too nosy.

#### Potions of Healing

Each week, Zoya brews up `1d6` [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) which she sells for 50 gold each. If paid in advance, once per day she can create a [potion of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) for 150 gp.

### Hendrix Farm

The Hendrix Farm is one of the only occupied farmsteads remaining in Emberwood Village. It was once run by an old human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) named Elijah Hendrix, until his crops became contaminated, his livestock perished, and his wife grew ill and passed away after the meteor fell. He gave up on farming, and nearly gave up on life as well. However, several years ago, [Lucretia Mathias](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/lucretia-mathias-dodk.md) stayed at his farmhouse during her first pilgrimage to Drakkenheim. Her words inspired him with renewed purpose, and he now offers shelter to any future pilgrims of the Falling Fire who are making the trek into Drakkenheim.

The fallow fields are devoid of crops and no longer used for agricultural production. Instead, they are littered with small campfires and tents for the passing pilgrims. The large wooden barn and nearby farmhouse are kept in good repair, though all the farm equipment and ploughs were long ago dismantled for parts.

**Nathaniel Flint** and many members of the Falling Fire gather here as their last stop before heading further into the ruins. At any given time there may be as many as fifty [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) congregating here with their wagons. Though he has been invited to come take the Sacrament himself many times, Farmer Hendrix believes it is his destiny to wait here until the very last pilgrim comes.

### Eventide Manor

This manor house on the south end of town burned down many years ago. It was once owned by a mysterious elven woman who had a child with a local craftsman, but was abandoned after she passed away and the boy was taken by the Amethyst Academy. Since it caught fire, none have come to claim or repair it. Children now tell tales of the strange noises coming from the cellar of the house, and how the charred doors and windows open and close on their own.

- Unbeknownst to the folk of Emberwood Village, this house was owned by a former Archmage of the Amethyst Academy. Behind an illusory wall in the cellar protected by a [glyph of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) is a [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) used today by members of the Amethyst Academy to come and go from their distant strongholds. Academy members only enter or exit the manor under the effects of an [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) spell, hence the children's rumours.  

### Caravan Court

A marketplace has sprung up surrounding the boarded-up water well in the village square. This colourful collection of caravans, wagons, canvas tents, and makeshift stalls is the hub of commerce for adventurers, scavengers, and prospectors looking to make their fortune in Drakkenheim. Dozens of canny merchants have set up shop here to cater to the needs of the factions and explorers.

Traders and new goods arrive here daily, and the market is constantly abuzz with explorers looking to sell relics and treasures unearthed in Drakkenheim, or buy equipment needed for a dangerous voyage into the city ruins. Amongst the bustle, heavily armed and armoured thugs load ponderous wagons with locked and leaden chests filled with delerium shards for trade in distant cities. Activity carries on through the afternoon, but most pack up shortly after sunset to head to the taverns and bars for drinks.

#### Marlowe's Provisions

> [!quote] A quote from Eren Marlowe  
> 
> Everyone's gotta eat! Don't want to go trouncing through dangerous ruins on an empty stomach! Oh, and please drink some water, you look parched.

Eren Marlowe, a human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), sets up a small makeshift stall with a few wooden tables displaying jars of dried fruits, packages of cured meats, jugs of water, mead, and bags of assorted nuts. Adventurers often come here for provisions that won't rot or spoil during their treks into the contaminated ruins.

- Any food, water, and rations can be purchased here for five times the market price  

#### Gainsbury Expeditionary Supply Company

> I guarantee you won't survive long in Drakkenheim without a good rope and a full lantern! Best buy them while supplies last!

This caravan is loaded high with boxes and barrels of goods. Laid out on a small table are samples of climbing gear, cartographer's instruments, goggles, heavy leather gloves, mining picks, torches, tongs, and assorted tools for navigation and survival in the ruins.

- Armin Gainsbury, a bespectacled and beanpole-shaped human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md), carries all manner of adventuring gear which they sell for twice the market value.  
- Gainsbury is especially well stocked on mining and prospecting equipment, and sells a pamphlet detailing the correct methods for safely handling and extracting delerium crystals. A copy costs 1 gp. The information inside is filled with hyperbolic (but correct) warnings. The instructions are overly detailed and rather long-winded, but reasonably accurate.  

#### Fairweather Trades and Exports

> When you've been around the world as many times as me, you see all manner of treasure. In all my years, I ain't never seen anything like these rocks. I'm happy to make a barrel or two of gold delivering it to whomever wants to empty their pockets for 'em.

An iron-bound stagecoach is parked here flanked by two massive flat-bedded wagons with stacks of leaden and steel-studded chests, overseen by a dozen armoured men.

- Orson Fairweather (a human [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) is among the most prolific exporters of delerium operating in Emberwood Village. The stout man has a heavily scarred and aged face, a leather eyepatch, and a mouth of gold teeth. He speaks little of his own history or exploits, but entertains rumours about his past life as a pirate and adventurer.  
- Fairweather has a security force of a dozen [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), and has paid the Amethyst Academy to create [arcane locks](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and [glyphs of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) to protect his wares from thieves.  

Fairweather is among the few merchants in town willing and able to purchase delerium in vast quantities. He offers half the list price in Appendix D and doesn't make deals. He furiously rebukes anyone who questions his motives or asks prying inquiries about his buyers. Countless folk in distant lands purchase delerium for unknown reasons, and in the grand scheme of things, Fairweather is just a middle man.

This massive and heaving covered carriage is decorated with gold filigree and glimmering lanterns. Hitched beside it are two great steel-skinned oxen that exhale green fumes from their snouts. Three lanky attendants garbed in light armour and carrying crossbows patrol the grounds.

Seated before the carriage on a buckling wooden chair is a massive human man who must be nearly seven feet tall and almost as wide. He is garbed in masterfully tailored jet-black silk that flatters his obese frame: a frilled doublet, padded breeches, and riding gloves, all worn under a great fur-lined cloak, topped with a feathered cap. Each piece is delicately embroidered with elegant silver trim. The smell of fine tobacco mixed with perfume hangs in the air around him. He smokes a fine black pipe and drinks from a bottle of vintage wine, a rakish grin on his flabby face. He greets characters warmly then rubs his hands together with anticipation. "Let's get down to business, shall we?"

- Aldor the Immense is a [djinni](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) who delights in mortal pleasures and freely travels the world as a dealer of exotic wares. He possesses a sharp wit, a sophisticated sense of humor, puissant skill with money, and a gluttonous appreciation for material indulgences.  
- His elemental nature is completely indiscernible, and he appears in all respects to be a grotesquely large human man. He wears an [amulet of proof against detection and location](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md).  
- Aldor the Immense deals in magic items and delerium. He is accustomed to small-time heroes attempting to browbeat him, would-be seducers looking to cut a deal, and two-bit thieves trying to rip him off. He is always one step ahead in the mental bargaining game.  
- His attendants and bodyguards are three human [assassins](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) named Brill, Meyers, and Vandeerbeek. His oxen are both [gorgons](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/gorgon.md).  
- Aldor the Immense has commissioned the Amethyst Academy to create [arcane locks](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) and [glyphs of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) to protect his wares. In addition, he has a *tiny chest* in which he keeps his own private treasures.

#### Magic Items for Sale

Aldor has an enigmatic and ever-shifting stock of magical items that replenishes each week.

![Toad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/DoDk/040-03-003.obese-toad.webp#center)

- `2d6` [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) (100 gp each) and `1d6` [potions of greater healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) (300 gp each)  
- [Spell scrolls](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) from the wizard spell list: `1d10` 1st level *spell scrolls* (75 gp each), `1d8` 2nd level *spell scrolls* (150 gp each), and `1d6` 3rd-level *spell scrolls* (450 gp each). Add twice the cost of any expensive components to the price of the scroll.  
- `1d4` randomly determined uncommon magic items sold for `3d6 x 100` gp each.  
- Material components for spells of 5th level and lower.  
- Use your discretion when generating these magic items. If you wish, occasionally Aldor the Immense might carry a single rare magic item, which he sells for 10,000 gp.  

## Concluding the Chapter

Allow player characters ample time getting familiar with Emberwood Village. Ensure characters gather a few rumours, make contact with at least two or three of the major faction agents, and encounter one or two groups of rival adventurers. In addition, player characters can take this opportunity to get to know one another more, and perhaps snoop around town for any information related to their personal quests.

Eventually, several townsfolk may begin asking characters if they've been to the ruins yet or tried their hand at collecting delerium shards. Boastful rival adventurers could even set up a wager. If characters are looking for advice, NPCs might recommend characters seek out Gainsbury Expeditionary Supply Company for equipment and information on harvesting delerium, or chat with Fairweather Trades and Exports about selling whatever they manage to dig up. The next chapter, Exploring Drakkenheim, details how characters can explore the ruins, and includes a "Delerium Hunt" to help run their first foray!

## Character Advancement

If your player characters began at 1st level and accompanied Eren Marlowe's caravan, after they've interacted with folk in Emberwood Village and met a few faction members, award them sufficient experience to advance them to 2nd level before they embark on their first foray into Drakkenheim.
