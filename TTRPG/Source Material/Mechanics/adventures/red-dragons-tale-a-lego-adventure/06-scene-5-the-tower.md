# Scene 5: The Tower
*Source: Red Dragon's Tale: A LEGO Adventure, p. 10* 

Make sure the Tower is fully assembled before running this part of the adventure. The tower has three floors, which are described in the sections that follow.

## First Floor: Shrine

When one or more Player Characters arrive here, read the following aloud:

> [!note] 
> 
> This level of the tower has a shrine backed against one wall. Carved above the shrine are five stone dragon heads, and resting on the shrine's altar is a lustrous green orb. A large key rests in a small stand on the floor.
^030

### Large Key

The large key unlocks the door to the prison cell in the dungeon (see scene 3). It also locks and unlocks the trap door described below.

### Trap Door

Just inside the door to this room, and exactly where one would stand to pick up the large key from its holder, is a hidden trap door. Any creature heavier than a housecat that steps on the trap door causes it to open, dropping the creature into the basement below (see scene 4). The creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall. A Player Character can use the large key described above to lock the trap door so that it doesn't open.

### Dragon Orb and Throne

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/LRDT/orb.webp#center)

An [Orb of Dragonkind](Mechanics/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md) rests on the shrine's altar. This powerful magic item contains the essence of an evil dragon and is dangerous to use. Whoever controls the orb can issue a telepathic call that extends for 40 miles in all directions. Evil Dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. If the orb is used in this way, Cinderhowl is the only dragon to answer the call, as described in scene 6.

The shrine itself was built by the tower's original owner, who was a member of an evil organization called the Cult of the Dragon. The stone heads above the altar represent Tiamat, the five-headed queen of evil dragons. The five dragon heads snap at any creature other than a Dragon or a dragonborn that touches the orb or the shrine. Make one attack roll (` + 5`). If the attack hits, whoever triggered the attack takes `5d6` piercing damage.

If you're not using D&D rules, the biting dragon heads hit automatically.

### Stairs to Second Floor

These winding steps ascend to the second floor. Under the stairs is a small alcove containing a [Potion of Clairvoyance](Mechanics/items/potion-of-clairvoyance.md) and a [giant wolf spider](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-wolf-spider.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for its stat block). The spider attacks any creature that tries to take the potion and defends itself if attacked.

## Second Floor: Arcane Workshop

This floor contains Ervan's workshop. The evil sorcerer is here when the Player Characters arrive, but he quickly retreats to the tower's peak. Set the scene by reading the following text aloud:

> [!note] 
> 
> This space contains all the makings of an arcane workshop: a red candle, a cauldron, assorted spell components, scrolls, and a lit brazier made from a humanoid skull.
> 
> Merry Rumwell greets your arrival with frustration. "Not you again! Go bother someone else!" With that, the form of the innkeeper melts away, replaced by that of a crimson-clad sorcerer who grabs a scroll and disappears yet again.
^036

Ervan casts another [Dimension Door](Mechanics/spells/dimension-door.md) spell and escapes before the Player Characters can do anything to him. He takes one of his Spell Scrolls with him (see "Searching the Workshop" below). The Player Characters catch up to Ervan in scene 6.

### Searching the Workshop

The candle, cauldron, spell components, and skull-shaped brazier are nonmagical. Amid these mundane items are the following treasures:

- **Coins.** Ervan leaves behind a stack of coins worth a total of 100 gold pieces.  
- **Scrolls.** Stacked on tables are three Spell Scrolls ([Animate Dead](Mechanics/spells/animate-dead.md), [Ice Storm](Mechanics/spells/ice-storm.md), and [Phantasmal Force](Mechanics/spells/phantasmal-force.md)). Before disappearing, Ervan takes a fourth scroll: a [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Hold Monster](Mechanics/spells/hold-monster.md).  

## Third Floor: Egg Chamber

When the Player Characters reach this floor, read the following aloud:

> [!note] 
> 
> At this height, not much of the tower remains. Resting on what's left of the third floor is a dragon egg surrounded by lit candles.
^039

Ervan placed candles around the dragon egg to keep it warm until it hatches. Away from its mother, the wyrmling takes much longer to hatch than normal—something the sorcerer didn't anticipate.

The dragon egg is visible from the tower's peak, where Ervan has chosen to make his final stand. If the characters look up, they see Ervan glaring at them. Read the following aloud:

> [!note] 
> 
> A ladder clinging to the wall stops just short of the tower's peak—little more than a stone shelf on which the sorcerer stands, scroll in hand. His clothes flap in the wind as he glares at you. "That's my egg!" he shouts.
^03a

The dragon egg is surprisingly resilient. Fire doesn't harm it, a fall won't break it, and nonmagical weapons can't crack it.

Despite the egg's natural resilience, Ervan won't risk damaging the egg by attacking Player Characters near it. If the characters seize the egg, Ervan yells, "Thieves!" Before Ervan can take further action, Cinderhowl catches sight of him and flies toward the tower. Continue with scene 6.
