# Scene 2: The Meadow
*Source: Red Dragon's Tale: A LEGO Adventure, p. 6* 

Make sure the Meadow is fully assembled before you run this part of the adventure, then read the following aloud to set the scene:

> [!note] 
> 
> Spiky ivy grows up the side of the crumbled tower, which is surrounded by a lush meadow. Next to the tower is an enormous tree with rustling leaves. Mushrooms grow in the shade under a stone bridge, which bears a carving of a dragon's face. Prowling the meadow is an owlbear that walks on all fours. It's clear that the owlbear is hunting three big spiders that crawl through the tall grass.

The dragon face carving on the bridge represents the Cult of the Dragon, suggesting this location was once used by members of that evil organization.

## Owlbear and Spiders

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/LRDT/owlbear.webp#center)

Three [giant spiders](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) are fleeing from a hungry [owlbear](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for both stat blocks). If the Player Characters kill a spider, the owlbear stops to eat it. Once it has eaten all three spiders, the owlbear is full and falls asleep. If the Player Characters attack or threaten either the owlbear or a spider, the creature attacks them in return or flees if it takes any damage.

Once the owlbear and spiders are dealt with, the Player Characters can explore the tree, the mushrooms under the bridge, and the ivy growing on the tower.

A character who searches the grass finds the spiders' hiding holes. The spiders have collected the following objects:

- **Coins.** Player Characters find loose coins worth 150 gold pieces.  
- **Golden Key.** Amid the coins is a golden key that unlocks the door to the dungeon (see "Awakened Tree" later in this scene).  

## Awakened Tree

If a Player Character stands close to the tree or tries to climb it, read the following aloud:

> [!note] 
> 
> Birds scatter from the tree as its limbs start to move. One of the branches moves to reveal a smiling wooden face.

Years ago, a druid used magic to turn the tree into an [awakened tree](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for its stat block). The awakened tree speaks slowly and thoughtfully, mostly about things like the weather and the seasons. It talks fondly of squirrels and birdsâ€”although less fondly of woodpeckers and "the sorcerer who lives in the tower."

If the Player Characters ask the awakened tree to share a secret or tell them what it knows, it shuffles aside and moves a rock to reveal a door leading to the dungeon below the tower. The handle to the door has a slight glow to it. Closer examination reveals that the door is held shut by an [Arcane Lock](Mechanics/spells/arcane-lock.md) spell. The golden key hidden by the spiders in the meadow opens it, as does a [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) or [Knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell cast by the Elf Wizard. The door can also be destroyed, but it will take a while and create a lot of noise. If the Player Characters enter the dungeon, advance to scene 3.

## Myconids Under the Bridge

Player Characters can rest in the soft grass under the bridge, which creates enough shade for two [myconids](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/myconid-sprout.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for their stat block) to dwell here comfortably. The myconids, which resemble oversized mushrooms, fight only in self-defense.

The myconids release spores that allow them to communicate telepathically with other intelligent creatures nearby. Player Characters who question the myconids learn the following information:

- **Disguised Sorcerer.** Merry Rumwell is an evil sorcerer named Ervan Soulfallen in disguise.  
- **Dungeon Prisoner.** Ervan has imprisoned the real innkeeper, Alax Jadescales, in the tower's dungeon.  
- **Magic Items.** Ervan recently ordered the myconids to bury some magic items. If the characters are friendly, the myconids dig up these items and give them to the characters. The items include a [Potion of Healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md), a [Potion of Resistance (Acid)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-acid-resistance.md), and a [Sentinel Shield](Mechanics/items/sentinel-shield.md).  

## Spiky Ivy

The spiky ivy growing up the side of the tower is strong enough to be climbed. If the Player Characters use the ivy to reach the upper levels of the tower, skip scene 3 and continue with scene 4 or 5, depending on how high they climb.
