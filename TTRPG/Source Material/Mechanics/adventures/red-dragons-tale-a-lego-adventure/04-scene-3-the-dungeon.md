# Scene 3: The Dungeon
*Source: Red Dragon's Tale: A LEGO Adventure, p. 7* 

Make sure the Dungeon is fully assembled before running this part of the adventure.

The Player Characters are most likely to arrive here via the door behind the awakened tree. Read the following aloud to set the scene:

> [!note] 
> 
> A torch lights the entrance to this musty dungeon. Leaning against one wall is a skeleton without a skull. Clutched in one of its bony hands is a fine scimitar. Other curious items—a shield, a book, and a frosty staff—are scattered throughout the gloom. A ladder ascends to a closed cell door.
> 
> Three black globs of ooze creep across the dungeon floor. Behind them, floating in the air, are several items: a glowing yellow gemstone, a skull, and a silvered frying pan.

## Oozes

Before the Player Characters can explore the rest of the dungeon, they must contend with several Oozes (see the "Monster Manual" for their stat blocks):

- **Black Puddings.** The black blobs creeping across the floor are three [black puddings](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md). They can't communicate with the Player Characters and are hostile. Swords and other slashing weapons have no effect on them, but the puddings are afraid of fire and won't attack anyone who carries a lit torch. Dealing fire damage to a pudding causes it to slink away. The puddings love hot sauce; if a character spills a jar of hot sauce on the floor, the puddings creep toward the hot sauce, ignoring other creatures as they do so. It takes them 1 minute to digest the sauce, during which time they won't attack unless they are disturbed.  
- **Gelatinous Cubes.** The glowing yellow gemstone, skull, and silvered frying pan appear to be floating because they're encased in a [gelatinous cube](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md). The cube is transparent and hostile. Player Characters near the cube can see its glistening form more clearly. Shambling quietly behind this cube is a baby gelatinous cube. The baby cube doesn't fight.  

The puddings and the cubes slowly dissolve the flesh of creatures they engulf. The digestive acid of the baby cube is weak, making it mostly harmless.

## Searching the Dungeon

After the Oozes are dealt with, Player Characters can loot the dungeon. It contains the following treasures:

- **Coins and Gems.** Player Characters can find an amethyst worth 500 gold pieces, a diamond worth 1,000 gold pieces, and a pile of loose coins worth 100 gold pieces. The glowing yellow gem inside the adult gelatinous cube is a topaz worth 500 gold pieces and has a [Continual Light](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spell cast on it.  
- **Book and Shield.** A [Tome of Clear Thought](Mechanics/items/tome-of-clear-thought.md) rests behind a [+1 Shield](Mechanics/items/1-shield.md). Tucked inside the book is a [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Speak with Dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md).  
- **Devotee's Censer.** This magic flail deals an extra `1d8` radiant damage on a hit and can be used as a holy symbol. As a bonus action, you can cause the head of the flail to release a thin cloud of incense within a 10-foot radius for 1 minute. At the start of each of your turns, you and any other creatures in the cloud each regain `1d4` hit points. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
- **Potion.** On a shelf behind the ladder is a [Potion of Speed](Mechanics/items/potion-of-speed.md).  
- **Scimitar.** The headless skeleton clutches a [Scimitar of Speed](Mechanics/items/scimitar-of-speed.md). Removing the blade from the skeleton's tight grip causes the skeleton to collapse into a pile of bones.  
- **Silvered Frying Pan.** This silver-plated frying pan is a family heirloom belonging to Alax Jadescales. Once freed from the prison cell (see "Freeing Alax" below), Alax tries to reclaim the frying pan.  
- **Staff and Shortbow.** A fully charged [Staff of Frost](Mechanics/items/staff-of-frost.md) juts from a barrel in one corner. Lying on the floor near the barrel is a nonmagical shortbow.  

### Cleric's Skull

The skull floating in the gelatinous cube belongs to Estus the Cleric, an ill-fated member of the Hard Way. A Player Character can use the [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of Speak with Dead to interrogate the skull and ask it up to five questions. It knows the following information:

- **Adventurers' Names.** The Hard Way had four members: Grackle the Rogue, Kildar the Wizard, Colin the Fighter, and Estus the Cleric.  
- **Dragon Egg.** Ervan hired the Hard Way to steal a dragon egg from the lair of Cinderhowl the red dragon. The adventurers waited for the dragon to leave her mountain lair before making their way inside.  
- **Hard-Won Victory.** The Hard Way killed several reptilian guards (kobolds) in the dragon's lair, stole an egg, and fled before the dragon's return.  
- **Sorcerer's Treachery.** After delivering the egg, the Hard Way demanded payment. Instead, Ervan used powerful magic to kill the group.  

## Freeing Alax

The door to the prison cell is locked and can be opened in one of several ways:

- The Elf Wizard can cast a [Knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell on the door, causing it to swing open.  
- The Gnome Fighter or Dwarf Cleric can break down the door. (It takes effort, but success is automatic.)  
- The Orc Rogue can use thieves' tools to pick the lock. (It takes a moment, but success is automatic.)  
- If the characters find the large key in scene 5, they can use it to unlock and lock the door.  

Trapped in the cell is [Alax Jadescales](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/alax-jadescales-lrdt.md) (see the "Nonplayer Characters" section at the end of the adventure for their stat block), the dragonborn proprietor of the Inn Plain Sight. True to their name, Alax has bright-green scales. They abhor violence and avoid combat.

Alax thanks the Player Characters for freeing them and says the adventurers can have all the hot wings they can eat once the sorcerer Ervan is no longer a threat. Alax looks forward to retrieving their silvered frying pan and offers to accompany the Player Characters until they find Alax's missing "cat"—a displacer beast named Pouncy (see scene 4). If the characters decline Alax's offer to join them, Alax returns to the inn and waits there instead. In either case, Alax advises the characters not to underestimate the evil sorcerer and shares the following helpful information:

- **Ervan's Plot.** Ervan hired a group of adventurers called the Hard Way to steal a dragon egg from the lair of a red dragon named Cinderhowl. The adventurers delivered the egg, but Ervan betrayed them. Instead of paying them, Ervan killed the adventurers and fed their corpses to the Oozes in the dungeon.  
- **Where's the Egg.** Ervan hid the dragon egg somewhere in the tower and is waiting for it to hatch.
