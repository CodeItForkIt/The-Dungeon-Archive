## About the Heroes

### Greetings, Dungeon Master

Before running the adventure, make sure the other players have each chosen a Player Character (Dwarf Cleric, Elf Wizard, Gnome Fighter, or Orc Rogue) and equipped their LEGO characters with the starting equipment noted in the Player Characters table.

Ask each player to give their character a name. Once all the Player Characters have names, read the following boxed text to the other players:

> [!note] 
> 
> During the adventure, when I ask you what you want your character to do, keep the following things in mind:
> 
> The [Dwarf Cleric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/pdf/LRDT/Dwarf%20Cleric.pdf) wears good armor, wields an impressive weapon, and channels both helpful and harmful magic through a holy symbol that embodies their faith.
> 
> The [Elf Wizard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/pdf/LRDT/Elf%20Wizard.pdf) knows many spells, including ones that create fireballs, turn creatures [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible), and dispel other magical effects. The wizard can also identify magic items.

## Running the Adventure

You can run this adventure in one of two ways:

- **Using D&D Rules.** If you and the other players are familiar with the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, you can run this adventure with the help of the fifth edition D&D core rulebooks ("Player's Handbook", "Dungeon Master's Guide", and "Monster Manual"). In addition to rules, these books contain descriptions of the creatures, spells, and items that appear in this adventure.  
- **Without D&D Rules.** If you or your players haven't played Dungeons & Dragons before, you can run this adventure as a storytelling experience without D&D rules. The "Without D&D Rules" section at the end of the adventure tells you how.  

## Adventure Overview

The adventure takes place amid the ruins of a stone tower located near a dusty road. This tower is home to a famous inn called the Inn Plain Sight. Travelers rave about the inn's food, especially the hot wings.

The "Sorcerer's Scheme" section below provides an overview of the villainous plot that sets the adventure in motion. The "Adventure Progression" section summarizes how events are likely to proceed once the Player Characters get involved. The remainder of the adventure is divided into six scenes. Each scene uses different elements of the LEGO Ideas set, describes important features in particular locations, and explains how creatures in each location behave.

### Sorcerer's Scheme

[Ervan Soulfallen](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ervan-soulfallen-lrdt.md), an evil sorcerer with a foul reputation, sought to obtain an egg from a red dragon. Wearing a magical disguise, Ervan traveled to the Inn Plain Sight, a roadside inn attached to a crumbling stone tower. Not too far from the ruined tower is a mountain where a red dragon named Cinderhowl dwells.

After imprisoning the innkeeper in the tower's dungeon, Ervan took over the inn under an assumed name: Merry Rumwell. A few days later, a group of adventurers called the Hard Way arrived at the inn. Ervan hired them to steal one of Cinderhowl's eggs, promising gold and free hot wings in return. When the adventurers delivered the egg to Ervan as planned, he betrayed them. He slew them with magic and hid their remains in the basement of the tower.

Expecting the egg's theft to infuriate Cinderhowl, Ervan chose to remain at the inn, out of the dragon's sight. He has hidden the egg and hopes it will hatch soon. Once the egg hatches, Ervan plans to train the dragon wyrmling to do his evil bidding.

The adventure begins when the Player Characters arrive at the inn unexpectedly, unaware that an evil sorcerer resides there in the guise of the innkeeper.

### Adventure Progression

The adventure progresses from one scene to another. Each scene has opportunities for exploration, social interaction, and combat:

- **Scene 1 Inn Plain Sight.** The Player Characters meet Merry Rumwell, the supposed proprietor of the Inn Plain Sight, who offers them hot wings. A search of the inn reveals all is not what it seems.  
- **Scene 2 The Meadow.** The inn is connected to a crumbling stone tower surrounded by a small meadow. Exploring the meadow uncovers a talking tree and more clues.  
- **Scene 3 The Dungeon.** The real innkeeper, Alax Jadescales, is imprisoned in this dungeon. The dungeon is also home to several nasty Oozes. Alax is grateful to Player Characters who free the innkeeper.  
- **Scene 4 The Basement.** Player Characters who search the tower's basement disturb the restless bones of some unlucky adventurers. They also find Alax's missing pet: a displacer beast transformed by magic into a many-eyed monster called a beholder.  
- **Scene 5 The Tower.** The tower is where Ervan keeps the stolen dragon egg and his other prized possessions. Player Characters also encounter a deadly shrine in the tower.  
- **Scene 6 The Dragon.** Cinderhowl the red dragon arrives at the tower and accuses the Player Characters of stealing her egg, mistaking them for a different group of adventurers. Meanwhile, Ervan tries to neutralize the dragon using magic. The Player Characters must survive the dragon and defeat the evil sorcerer to win the day.
