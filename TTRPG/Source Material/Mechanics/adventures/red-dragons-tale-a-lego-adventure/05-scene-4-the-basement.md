# Scene 4: The Basement
*Source: Red Dragon's Tale: A LEGO Adventure, p. 8* 

Make sure the tower's Basement is fully assembled before running this part of the adventure.

## Axe Trap

The door leading from the dungeon to the tower's basement is trapped. Opening it causes an axe blade to swing from above. Any creature standing in the doorway when the axe swings down must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `2d8` slashing damage. The trap can be reset manually but doesn't reset by itself.

The Orc Rogue can automatically disable this trap, but only if the rogue is on the side of the door where the trap can be seen.

## Basement Features

Use the following text to describe the contents and occupants of the basement:

> [!note] 
> 
> You've reached the bottom of the tower, as evidenced by the stone staircase that curls upward. Candlelight illuminates a pair of doors and some scattered treasure.
> 
> Standing in this basement are three animated skeletons dressed like adventurers. Tucked in a corner nearby are some brightly colored plants. Floating in the middle of the room is a terrifying, spherical monster with sharp teeth, one big eye, and ten smaller eyes on wriggling stalks.

### Pouncy

The Player Characters recognize the many-eyed monster as a beholder, which has the power to emit an [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) cone of anti-magic from its central eye. However, this beholder is not what it seems. It is really Alax's missing pet, a [displacer beast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for its stat block) named Pouncy. Ervan used a powerful scroll to polymorph Pouncy into a beholder.

If Alax is with the Player Characters, Pouncy's initial attitude is friendly. The beholder rushes toward Alax and begins to lick Alax's face—a clear signal that the beholder is not what it seems. If Alax isn't present, the beholder bares its teeth and keeps its distance, but doesn't attack except in self-defense. Offering it milk or calling it Pouncy changes its attitude to friendly.

If Alax or one of the Player Characters can reflect the beholder's anti-magic cone back on it using a polished object such as a silvered frying pan, the polymorph effect on Pouncy ends, restoring the displacer beast to its natural form. The Elf Wizard can also restore Pouncy's true form by casting [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the beholder.

Once Alax is reunited with Pouncy, they both return to the inn, trusting the Player Characters can deal with Ervan on their own. However, if the Player Characters call for help, Alax and Pouncy rejoin them.

### The Hard Way

The three [skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) (see the "Monster Manual" for their stat block) are Undead—the hostile remains of three members of the Hard Way (the group of adventurers hired by Ervan to steal the dragon egg).

These skeletons fight until destroyed and carry the following treasure:

- **Fighter.** This skeleton wears a [+1 Breastplate](Mechanics/items/1-armor.md) and a nonmagical helm, and it carries a [Sword of Sharpness](Mechanics/items/sword-of-sharpness.md).  
- **Rogue.** This skeleton carries a [Dagger of Venom](Mechanics/items/dagger-of-venom.md) and wears a [Ring of Invisibility](Mechanics/items/ring-of-invisibility.md).  
- **Wizard.** This skeleton wears a magic cloak that has the properties of a [Robe of Scintillating Colors](Mechanics/items/robe-of-scintillating-colors.md).  

Once the skeletons are defeated, a Player Character can use the [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of Speak with Dead found in scene 3 (if it hasn't already been used) to interrogate the skull of one of the dead adventurers and ask it up to five questions. The skull knows the same information as the one in scene 3.

### Poisonous Plants

The plants that grow in the basement are pink and extremely poisonous. Any creature that so much as touches one of these plants takes `2d6` poison damage.

### Staircase

The Player Characters can climb the staircase to reach the upper levels of the tower. If they take the stairs, continue with scene 5.

### Treasure

After the skeletons are dealt with, Player Characters can loot the basement. It contains the following treasures:

- **Book.** A [Manual of Quickness of Action](Mechanics/items/manual-of-quickness-of-action.md) rests near some poisonous plants. Tucked inside the book is a [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Protection from Energy](Mechanics/spells/protection-from-energy.md).  
- **Coins.** Lying on the floor is pile of loose coins worth 100 gold pieces.  
- **Lantern.** A [Lantern of Revealing](Mechanics/items/lantern-of-revealing.md) sits in an alcove.  
- **Potion.** Set atop high shelves are a [Potion of Healing (Greater)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md) and a [Potion of Heroism](Mechanics/items/potion-of-heroism.md).
