# Without D&D Rules
*Source: Red Dragon's Tale: A LEGO Adventure, p. 13* 

The following system can help you run the adventure without D&D rules. If you're not sure how to resolve a situation using the system outlined below, hot wing it.

## Taking Turns

During each scene of the adventure, minifigures take turns in the following order unless everyone agrees to some other arrangement:

- Orc Rogue  
- Elf Wizard  
- Gnome Fighter  
- Dwarf Cleric  
- Creatures controlled by the Dungeon Master  

## What Can Happen on a Turn

What minifigures can do is limited only by the players' imaginations. On each of its turns, a minifigure can do whatever activities the player controlling that minifigure wants it to do, subject to the Dungeon Master's approval. Encourage everyone to be creative. Here are examples of activities a minifigure can do on its turn:

- **Attack.** The minifigure can try to damage another creature or an object using a spell, a weapon, an element of the environment, or something else. (You decide if this is possible.) See "Damage" below for more information.  
- **Drop, Grab, or Move an Item.** The minifigure can drop an item it is holding, grab an item not being held or worn by another creature, or move an item not being held or worn by anyone. (Grabbing an item requires a free hand. You decide if an item is too big to be picked up or moved.)  
- **Move.** The minifigure can move to any area of the set that has been built and is reachable. (You decide if an area is reachable.)  
- **Other.** The minifigure can try to accomplish something not otherwise accounted for in this section, such as forcing open a locked door, using a [Jump](Mechanics/spells/jump.md) spell to leap to the top of a wall, or sneaking past a monster without being detected. If the minifigure has a skill, spell, or magic item that can help it accomplish what its player wants to do, assume it is successful.  

## Damage

Alax Jadescales, Ervan Soulfallen, and the Player Characters have special rules for determining what happens when they take damage (see "Special Characters" below). For all other creatures, use the following rules.

When a creature is attacked with a weapon or a damage-dealing spell, or is subject to some other damaging effect, it automatically loses one or more Points unless you can think of a reason why it shouldn't. You decide how many Points the minifigure loses, but here are some suggestions:

- 1 Point if the minifigure is subjected to a short fall, a minor trap, an attack made with a nonmagical weapon, or a damage-dealing spell of 1st level or lower  
- 2 Points if the minifigure is subjected to a high fall, a deadly trap, an attack made with a magical weapon, or a 2nd-level spell that deals damage  
- 3 Points if the minifigure is subjected to a 3rd-level spell that deals damage or some other devastating effect, such as a dragon's breath, weapon or a collapsing building  

You decide how many Points a creature can lose before it surrenders, flees, or dies. A big creature like Cinderhowl has lots of Points to lose, while a smaller minifigure might have only one or two.

### Special Characters

Whenever the minifigure of Alex Jadescales, Ervan Soulfallen, or a Player Character becomes the target of a weapon attack, a damage-dealing spell, or some other damaging effect, resolve the outcome with a coin toss using the system outlined below:

- **Target Wins.** The minifigure isn't damaged.  
- **Target Loses.** The minifigure is Knocked Down by the damage and must use its next turn to stand up; it can do nothing else on that turn. The minifigure can avoid being Knocked Down by removing one accessory it is wearing or carrying. The removed item is either lost or destroyed; either way, it is no longer in play.  

#### Three Falls, You're Out

Any minifigure that is Knocked Down by damage three times during a scene is Knocked Out (unable to take turns) until the next scene begins; the same rule applies to Alax Jadescales. If all the Player Characters' minifigures are Knocked Out when the Dungeon Master's turn begins, the adventure ends in defeat.

If Ervan Soulfallen is Knocked Down three times during a scene, he surrenders, escapes, or dies (your choice).

## Adjudicating Saving Throws

Whenever a Player Character becomes the target of an effect that allows a saving throw, resolve the outcome with a coin toss using the system outlined below:

- **Player Character Wins.** The character is unaffected.  
- **Player Character Loses.** The character loses one piece of equipment they are wearing or carrying. The item is removed from play and no longer obtainable. If the character has no items to lose, the character is Knocked Down instead (see "Three Falls, You're Out!" above).  

## Using Magic Items

Magic items are scattered throughout the adventure. You and the other players can invent effects for these items, using the suggestions below to inspire you:

### +1 Breastplate

Nonmagical, handheld weapons can't harm the minifigure wearing this breastplate.

### +1 Shield

A minifigure equipped with this shield can use it to shove another creature. The shield also protects against incoming arrows and breath weapons.

### Dagger of Venom

If a minifigure is hidden before making an attack with this dagger, the dagger's poison deals extra damage.

### Devotee's Censer

When used as a flail, this magic censer automatically destroys any Undead creature it hits.

### Lantern of Revealing

A minifigure can use this lantern to see [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creatures and objects.

### Manual of Quickness of Action

After a minifigure reads this magic book, the book vanishes, and the minifigure gains the ability to perform amazing acrobatic feats for the rest of the adventure.

### Orb of Dragonkind

Three times during the adventure, the orb can be used to teleport its holder to a safe location of the holder's choice within the confines of the built LEGOÂ® set. The orb also has the power to summon evil dragons, as described in scene 5.

### Potion of Clairvoyance

Drinking this potion allows a minifigure to see or hear what's going on in a location that is otherwise beyond the range of its senses. For example, this potion can help a minifigure see what's on the opposite side of a closed door.

### Potion of Healing

Feeding this potion to a Knocked Out minifigure ends that effect on it, allowing the minifigure to resume taking turns. In addition, the minifigure's Knocked Down count for the current scene resets to 0. Alternatively, if a minifigure missing one or more Points drinks this potion, it regains one of its missing Points.

### Potion of Healing (Greater)

This potion is identical to a [Potion of Healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) (see above), except two missing Points are regained instead of one.

### Potion of Heroism

After drinking this potion, a minifigure can perform impressive feats of strength and athleticism until the current scene ends.

### Potion of Resistance (Acid)

After drinking this potion, a minifigure is immune to acid until the current scene ends.

### Potion of Speed

After drinking this potion, a minifigure can make an extra attack on each of its turns and moves more rapidly than normal. These effects end when the current scene ends.

### Ring of Invisibility

On the minifigure's turn, it can don this ring to become [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) or remove the ring to become visible again.

### Robe of Scintillating Colors

The minifigure can command this article of clothing to shed bright light in a dazzling array of colors that enemies can't bear to look at.

### Scimitar of Speed

On its turn, a minifigure holding this scimitar can attack twice with it instead of once.

### Sentinel Shield

Whoever holds this shield is great at spotting and finding things.

### Spell Scroll of Animate Dead

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Animate Dead](Mechanics/spells/animate-dead.md) spell, which transforms inanimate bones into an Undead skeleton under the caster's control.

### Spell Scroll of Hold Monster

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Hold Monster](Mechanics/spells/hold-monster.md) spell on another minifigure, preventing it from doing anything on its next turn.

### Spell Scroll of Ice Storm

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Ice Storm](Mechanics/spells/ice-storm.md) spell, which deals damage to all creatures in the storm's area.

### Spell Scroll of Invisibility

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md) spell on itself or another minifigure. The spell's recipient is [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until it attacks or casts a spell.

### Spell Scroll of Mage Armor

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Mage Armor](Mechanics/spells/mage-armor.md) spell on itself or another minifigure, encasing the spell's recipient in magical armor.

### Spell Scroll of Magic Missile

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Magic Missile](Mechanics/spells/magic-missile.md) spell, creating three magical darts that automatically hit their targets.

### Spell Scroll of Phantasmal Force

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Phantasmal Force](Mechanics/spells/phantasmal-force.md) spell, which creates an illusion of a creature or an object. The illusion lasts until the end of the current scene, but the caster can make it vanish before then.

### Spell Scroll of Protection from Energy

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Protection from Energy](Mechanics/spells/protection-from-energy.md) spell, either on itself or on another creature, giving the spells' target immunity to one type of energy (such as cold or fire) until the end of the current scene.

### Spell Scroll of Speak with Dead

The scroll turns to dust as the minifigure casts the [Speak with Dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell, which lets the caster interrogate a nearby inanimate skull, asking it up to five questions.

### Staff of Frost

A minifigure holding this staff can cause it to project a cone of cold energy at another minifigure. In addition to taking cold damage, the target can't do anything on its next turn.

### Sword of Sharpness

This sword is so sharp that it can cut through wood and stone. It can be used to break off elements of buildings and other large objects.

### Tome of Clear Thought

After a minifigure reads this magic book, the book vanishes, and the minifigure gains special knowledge previously unknown to it, which takes the form of a secret or hint revealed by the Dungeon Master.
