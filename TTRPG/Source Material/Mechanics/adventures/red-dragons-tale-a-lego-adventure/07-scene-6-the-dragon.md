# Scene 6: The Dragon

This final scene marks the arrival of Cinderhowl, who is searching the countryside for signs of the thieves who stole her egg. Activity atop the ruined tower draws her attention:

The adventure concludes with a double "boss fight." The Player Characters must deal with two foes at once: Cinderhowl and Ervan Soulfallen. Clever characters can turn one of these foes against the other.

## Cinderhowl

Cinderhowl is a hostile [adult red dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-red-dragon.md) who speaks Common (the language of common folk) and Draconic (the language of dragons). Her senses are excellent, and hiding the egg from her is nearly impossible. She accuses those closest to the egg of being thieves and threatens to roast them alive unless the egg is given to her at once.

Nothing the Player Characters say can quench Cinderhowl's rage. The dragon is convinced Ervan hired them to steal her egg. As an action, a character can try to redirect Cinderhowl's rage toward Ervan, doing so with a successful DC 20 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Use whichever skill seems most appropriate.

If Cinderhowl was lured to the tower by the [Orb of Dragonkind](Mechanics/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md) (see scene 5), the dragon tries to kill whoever has the orb after the egg is safely in her custody. If a Player Character willingly gives her the orb, Cinderhowl keeps it while granting nothing in return.

If Cinderhowl regains the egg but seems on the verge of losing the battle, she takes the egg back to her mountain lair after warning the Player Characters that she will haunt their nightmares.

## Ervan Soulfallen

[Ervan Soulfallen](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ervan-soulfallen-lrdt.md) (see the "Nonplayer Characters" section at the end of the adventure for his stat block) targets Cinderhowl with his [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Hold Monster](Mechanics/spells/hold-monster.md). If Cinderhowl fails her saving throw, she has the [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition for the spell's duration and falls to the ground, giving Ervan time to snatch the egg and run. If Cinderhowl succeeds on the saving throw, she laughs at Ervan's "puny magic." Either way, the scroll turns to dust after Ervan casts the spell from it.

Ervan would sooner die than give up the egg.
