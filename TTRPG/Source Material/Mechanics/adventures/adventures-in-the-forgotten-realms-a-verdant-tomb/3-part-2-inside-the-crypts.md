# Part 2: Inside the Crypts
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: A Verdant Tomb, p. 5* 

The first areas inside the mausoleum are open to each other and can quickly become a single, harrowing encounter.

The last humanoid trespassers at this site—before the adventurers—were here to loot the place. Four human grave-robbers swam in through the facade a few years ago and, after ransacking area 5, attracted the attention of a shambling mound that often stalks this area. It is likely still here when the adventurers intrude. Its hulking mass includes the bones of the grave-robbers now.

Bound to the shambler and the bones within it is a wraith formed from the hateful greed of the lead grave-robber. The wraith haunts its grave, which is essentially inside the shambling mound. The wraith doesn't attack the shambler; it goes where the shambler goes.

The other three grave-robbers now haunt this place as three specters under the wraith's command. They tend to gather in area 6, near the treasures they collected.

## General Features

The tombs demonstrate fine designs and quality work, all allowed to rot through neglect.

## Construction

The interior spaces here were meant for somber memorials and funeral services. The stonework was well done but has been slowly sinking and sagging in mud over decades. The marble floors and carved walls are no longer plumb but are not dangerous.

## Ceilings

Most ceilings throughout the tombs are arched to a height of 8 feet. Many are painted with murals of cloudy-blue or starry-night skies, flaking and moldy now.

## Light

No natural light makes it into the mausoleum, except for a bit of overcast spill lighting in area 4. Every chamber has iron sconces for torches or lanterns, but no torches or lanterns remain.

## Sound

Marble floors and walls carry footfalls, voices, and other echoes throughout the place.

## 4. Ceremonial Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Part of this room is partially submerged in green water, filling what might have once been a ceremonial pool. The rest of this marble chamber is a few stairs above the water line, but still mossy and slick with algae.
^01c

This space was intended for quiet contemplation and solemn services to honor the dead. It served those purposes for many years. Now it is rotting and crumbling. Loose treasures of monetary value were carried from here into area 6 by the grave-robbers before they died.

## 5. Northern Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The green, iron gate meant to close off this chamber has been pried open. Part of the latch still clings to the marble frame. The stone sarcophagi inside appear intact, but the place is a mess of leaves, mud, and toppled urns.
^01e

This area was thoroughly looted by the grave-robbers a few years ago. All items of monetary value are now in area 6, where the robbers took them before they died.

## 6. Southern Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The iron gate meant to guard this chamber hangs on its last hinge. The room beyond is stained with mud and blood, littered with torn clothes and cast-off buckles. A rusty axe juts from dead vines and reeds tangled in the muddy floor.
^020

The grave-robbers fled here to save their spoils and their lives from the attack of the shambling mound. They failed. Amid inches of mud and debris on the ground are their rotting backpacks and the treasures they gathered.

If they have not already, the three specters attack when "their" treasures are disturbed here.

### Treasure

The grave-robbers had gathered grave goods, candlesticks, metal fixtures, and other art objects worth a total of 440 gp, plus a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), a [potion of healing (greater)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), and a [chime of opening](Mechanics/items/chime-of-opening.md).

## 7. Grand Mausoleum

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This wide, grand hall hosts rows of sealed compartments for coffins and urns. The room is angled roughly to the west, where it has settled unevenly. Water has clearly half-flooded this room before, based on the water damage and masses of rushes, vines, and reeds clinging to the mossy walls. Golden pans, meant to hold lamp oil, hang from the ceiling.
^024

The leader of the grave-robbers had barely set foot in this chamber when he was attacked. As such, it faintly glitters with traces of silver and gold from chalices, medals, statuettes, and other mementos.

A total of thirty-six people were interred in the eastern wall of this chamber. As was the custom in Secomber, none of them were interred with treasures of note.

### Development

If the shambling mound and the wraith have not yet appeared, they are here.

### Treasure

Many mementos scattered throughout this chamber have rotted to junk, but gold trinkets, silver funerary items, and other personal treasures of value remain, altogether worth 540 gp.

## 8. Processional Corridor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The door to the area beyond is clearly an addition to the chamber but is still probably decades old. The red granite in the doorway may have been sealed once, but gaps have formed as the mausoleum has sunk.
^029

The threshold above the doorway to area 8 is etched with the name Everlake. Prying open this broken seal requires a successful DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

In the corridor, 30 feet beyond the once-sealed doorway, Sylvene installed one of her magic stele traps, facing this door. It has disadvantage on its passive [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) score to detect trespassers peering through the gaps in the doorway.

### Magic Stele Trap

The stele can detect trespassers out to a range of 60 feet in front of it. It has a passive [Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) score of 18. To disarm or dispel this trap requires a successful DC 18 check. When triggered, the trap emits a bolt of lightning 60 feet long. Any creature in the target area that fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (`4d10`) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming nothing more than inert stone.

> [!note] Medallion of Safe Passage
> 
> Marks of safe passage found in the Wizard's Barrow, in a previous adventure, also work here. Creatures wearing a medallion of safe passage do not trigger the magic stele trap but are not immune to its lightning if it is triggered by someone or something else.
^medallion-of-safe-passage

Aside from housing the trap, this corridor is meant simply to set Waltarn's crypt deeper into the cliff face, to protect it from erosion and settling for a time.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Red granite supports and details, from rock frequently mined along the nearby cliffs, enliven the gray stones here. Although this corridor is clearly of more recent construction, it struggles against the shifting ground, too. Fitted stones are being pulled apart from each other over years of slow movement.
^02d

The corridor is in considerably better shape at its north end, where a second seal was installed to further prevent intrusions. This slab is better seated in place, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to force open.

## 9. Tiled Passage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The passage here is decorated with fine tile in an abstract, dwarven style. Though the stairs have settled unevenly, the passage itself is level and tidy.
^02f

This short passage was a gift to Sylvene from Artura, to wow her upon her entrance to the site for Waltarn's burial. It was never intended to be trapped, but it is now. This is as far as Tyreus ventured into the tomb after entering through area 11. He left two traps here using [linked glyphs](Mechanics/spells/linked-glyphs-aitfr-avt.md) (see appendix A). Finding any of these glyphs requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

First, an alarm glyph has been placed on the stairs (A) to alert Tyreus and let him know it is time for him to cast [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) and appear in area 11.

Secondly, a detection glyph has been placed on the stairs in almost the same spot (A), linked to an effect glyph (B), which casts [fear](Mechanics/spells/fear.md) (DC 17) up the stairs to the east when any humanoid creature touches or passes over the detection glyph.

Tyreus's aim is to drive [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) intruders toward the spell glyphs in area 10.

## 10. Memorial Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This gray chamber features half-pillars, arches, and recessed murals in excellent condition. The south wall shows a wide, shining lake amid green highlands, all beneath brilliant clouds. The north wall is divided into four stylized portraits depicting a female dwarf, a male human, a female human, and, judging by the scale of the details, a male giant.
^031

The highland lake is a depiction of Highstar Lake in the northern region of the High Moors—a spot Waltarn loved when he visited it with his fellow adventurers. The murals are works by the Waterdhavian artist Saraque Skyhill.

The four figures depicted here are the members of Sylvene's final adventuring party, as commissioned by Sylvene. From left to right:

- Artura Dwaircalis  
- Waltarn Everlake  
- Sylvene herself  
- Hamish Hewland  

Tyreus hated this room. He has hidden a glyph of warding on Waltarn's face, created to cast [phantasmal killer](Mechanics/spells/phantasmal-killer.md) on the first humanoid to get within 5 feet of the glyph.

## 11. Grand Crypt

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From the vaulted, blue-and-gold ceiling to the circular, brass seal in the floor and the twin, bare-stone sarcophagi, this tomb looks lavishly made and firmly intact.
^033

This chamber's sarcophagi contain the coffins of Sylvene and Waltarn—unopened and intact—plus a recessed prayer area to the north and a ritual cleansing area to the south. The pillars that support the area are carved with spiral whorls like the stele outside the Wizard's Barrow (from In Scarlet Flames). All the metal fixtures in this area have a green patina and are made to form similar spirals where they can.

Sylvene didn't return to the Sword Coast as she intended to, and her sarcophagus here is empty. (She is interred somewhere in Ravnica.)

The brass seal is the site of an etched and dyed teleportation circle. It was used by Sylvene to visit the site, by Artura to attend to maintenance here, and by Tyreus to plunder the crypt.

While here, Tyreus removed five keystones of creation from the crypt. They were set in the eastern wall and had never been attuned, so soon their power can still be his.

### Development

If he can arrange it, Tyreus appears to be standing in the teleportation circle when the adventurers arrive. (It is actually an illusory image of Tyreus, who is hundreds of miles away at Highstar Lake and making use of a [project image](Mechanics/spells/project-image.md) spell.)

The human before you appears pale but flushed, with dark hair in a long braid and an exquisitely trimmed beard. He wears dark, fitted clothes and high boots along with a fine blue overcoat. He looks relieved that you're here.

Tyreus wanted to see the adventurers, both to satisfy his curiosity and to help him scry on them, if they survive his trap. He intends to let one of the adventurers escape to sow fear.

In the meantime, Tyreus is happy to converse with the adventurers and learn what he can from them. He tries to keep their attention on him so his minions can close in on them: Tyreus has placed two tenebrous assassins in the crypt. They arrived with him earlier and he left them behind. They have taken up hiding spots in the crypt and attempt to avoid detection by the adventurers until Tyreus gives the order to attack.

### Trap

Tyreus' final trap is a pair of linked glyphs: a detection glyph (A) on the ground between the coffins and an effect glyph (b) to create a wall of fire that blocks the entrance.

### Treasure

Funeral goods, mementos, prayer objects, and other nonmagical treasures in the area are made predominantly of silver, worth a total of 510 gp. In a prayer bowl in the northern area of the crypt waits more treasure, overlooked by Tyreus when he was here: two [chips of creation](Mechanics/items/chip-of-creation-aitfr-avt.md) (see appendix B).

> [!note] Variant: Tenebrous Assassins
> 
> Tyreus's assassins are shadowy monstrosities he found deep in underground warrens beneath Ravnica. They have pebbly, gray, hairless skin, no mouths, and no capacity for speech. They do not require food or drink but do breathe and sleep. If slain, they dissolve into smoke, leaving behind their equipment.
> 
> These assassins believe Tyreus is coming back for them, but that is unlikely.
^variant-tenebrous-assassins

### Tyreus Came to Talk

Tyreus likes to hear himself talk. He believes himself to be uniquely clever and unfairly lonely. He isn't worried about the adventurers' capacity to get in his way at this stage. He'd rather gloat, order their elimination, and talk while they fight his assassins.

In so doing, Tyreus might mention the following:

- He only recently learned—from diaries he took from Sylvene's libraries—that Waltarn Everlake was his grandfather. He's not impressed with Waltarn; Tyreus considers him a weak, common simpleton.  
- Waltarn and his family didn't want him brought back to life after he was slain on an adventure. "What cowards," Tyreus might say. "What a lack of vision."  
- Tyreus took the five keystones of creation Sylvene attempted to hide here with Waltarn. With them, he will "create for myself a place worthy of the followers I deserve."
