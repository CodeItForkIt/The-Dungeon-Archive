# Appendix A: New Spells
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: A Verdant Tomb, p. 9* 

Tyreus uses the [linked glyphs](Mechanics/spells/linked-glyphs-aitfr-avt.md) spell to trap Sylvene's tomb against interlopers like the adventurers. If this spell becomes known to others, it can appear on the bard, cleric, wizard, and artificer spell lists. The spell mighty fortress first appeared in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and is included here for reference.
