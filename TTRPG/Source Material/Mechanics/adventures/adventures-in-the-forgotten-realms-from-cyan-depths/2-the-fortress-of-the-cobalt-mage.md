# The Fortress of the Cobalt Mage
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: From Cyan Depths, p. 4* 

The adventure begins when the adventurers get close enough to Tyreus's fortress to scout the area. Exactly how close that is depends on the spells and other powers available to them. The fortress is easy to spot, located right on the shore in the southwest region of Highstar Lake. The fortress also has excellent sight lines to the surrounding countryside, with at least half a mile of open wetlands and grasslands in every direction offering minimal cover to approaching creatures.

## Forces Gathered

In these early days of faction-forming and army-building, Tyreus's defenses are dangerous but full of holes. The fortress is staffed with dozens of unseen servants, conjured when the fortress was. They make poor defenders but can respond to trouble by ringing the wall-mounted bells meant to summon the servants. Meanwhile, some of the mercenaries present likely stand watch atop the walls and towers, looking out for approaching trouble. They are few in number but confident in their belief that any travelers in sight are potentially trouble.

### Elementals

Tyreus has used up a number of magical resources he once possessed to form tenuous bonds with a few elementals in the region. He tasked them with scouring the lakeshore for the Stone of Creation. When it was found, just offshore amid heaps of loose stones, Tyreus used a [telekinesis](Mechanics/spells/telekinesis.md) spell and the elementals' help to bring the Stone into his keep's cellar vault (area 8).

A handful of ill-tempered elementals still roam the area. They are not loyal to Tyreus or the mercenaries, but they welcome opportunities to do battle with Tyreus's enemies—until they grow bored with Tyreus or find better allies, that is. Then they might turn on him and his mercenaries. It is often difficult to predict the whims of elementals.

Two [air elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md), two [water elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md), and one [earth elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) roam the lakeshore's waters, stony edges, and skies near the fortress.

### Mercenaries

The mercenaries on site have come to see about making a client of Tyreus. He has summoned them so that he can bribe each mercenary army with a keystone of creation. Tyreus has promised each mercenary leader a fortress in exchange for their service pacifying the High Moors and bringing Secomber into his control. Neither mercenary captain has agreed—yet—but both will if given time. None of the mercenaries trust Tyreus, but they believe he can be endured long enough to build up wealth and then possibly be usurped or defeated in a few years.

By day, the mercenaries train in the fortress's narrow yard or the surrounding fields. By night, they drink and tell stories, occasionally meeting and mingling with their counterparts. Most of them are eager to get their keystone and leave, but Tyreus is drawing their visit out until the mercenaries' reinforcements arrive to serve and defend Tyreus.

Each of the visiting, villainous cadres consists of five [mercenary envoys](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mercenary-envoy-aitfr-fcd.md) (see appendix A) and a leader who together represent a larger group of soldiers of fortune. The larger groups these envoys represent are waiting elsewhere in the Realms for their envoys to return with keystones of their own.

#### The Banner of Blades

Founded and led by Audra Drakesblade (female half-elf, lawful evil, [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) just ten years ago, the mercenaries of the Banner of Blades have a growing reputation in the Sword Coast. Some see them as troublemakers, others as troubleshooters, but they are undeniably effective. Supposedly trained and tested by battles throughout lands to the south, rumors claim they are an invading army in disguise. In truth, the Banner of Blades has attracted outcasts, survivors, and other remnants from broken armies—soldiers who crave regimented diligence and the capable leadership Audra provides. Soldiers of the Banner see themselves not as a single army of three-hundred mercenaries but as five- and ten-person squads with reinforcements throughout the Realms. They simply all fight under the same emblem: a green banner decorated with swords arrayed in diamond formation.

#### The Iron Lions

For decades, the Iron Lions have fancied themselves a secret menace. Most fighting folk of the Sword Coast have never heard of them, and the Lions like it that way—all warfare is based on deception—leaving the Lions to boast, brag, and lie in equal measure about battles they've won or survived. Today, the Iron Lions consist of a hundred or so seasoned soldiers in search of fortune. This is the smallest their makeshift army has ever been; these are lean times. Their current commander, Gollis "Leonid" Stamper (male human, neutral evil, [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)), is the grandson of the company's founder, Goran, but he didn't inherit his role. Gollis took leadership of the Lions two years ago by coaxing his commander into a duel and slaughtering him. The emblem of the Iron Lions is a simple iron-gray lion's head on a red flag.

> [!note] Mercenaries with Familiar Faces
> 
> If your campaign made use of the first adventure in this series, "In Scarlet Flames," these mercenaries present an opportunity to involve some familiar NPCs. Presuming they survived previous adventures and are still in the mercenary business, Lothar Stoutsmark (male human, chaotic neutral, bandit captain) and his cohorts—Gordo, Vic, and Rora (all spies)—can also be in attendance at Tyreus's fortress. They camp in the lakeshore yard. Their history with the adventurers may create new opportunities or challenges for everyone involved.

## Features of the Fortress

Every part of the fortress mimics some aspect of another castle, keep, or fort seen by Tyreus over the years. The result is a strange hodgepodge of architectural styles, from the mundane functionality of the central guard tower to the fanciful sweeping arches of the northern and southern walls. Those walls offer little protection against any kind of military attack or siege. Their purpose is to imitate the decorative walls of a large scholastic building Tyreus admired in Ravnica.

Tyreus doesn't care that so much of the structure serves little purpose as a fortress. Its job is to intrigue and entice, and it doesn't have to last long. He expects to revise or dispel the fortress anyway and conjure another fortress when the mood strikes him.

### Ceilings

In the towers, rooms are 9 feet high with flat, stone ceilings. In his own keep, Tyreus conjured 10-foot ceilings with decorative timber rafters from which he could hang lanterns and other details he imagined into existence.

### Doors

Most doors here are conjured wood with iron hinges and fixtures. Each door is 7 feet tall and rounded at the top.

### Light

Much of the fortress allows ample natural light during the day, despite the security risks. The servants light conjured torches and candles all throughout the fortress around dusk, keeping things well lit. Guests are welcome to snuff out lights overnight as they see fit.

### Sound

Most areas have stone floors without rugs or rushes to soften them. Tyreus didn't think to include such details outside of his own keep. Every floor of every tower features a simple handbell hung from the wall somewhere, allowing the place's servants to be summoned—or to raise an alarm.

## Locations at the Fortress

Each key area of the fortress is described here, often with different floors grouped together by the tower or other structure they are part of.

### 1. Lakeshore Gate

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> It's an impressive wooden gate with ornate iron fixtures. The door itself is etched deep with depictions of a sprawling castle beneath a starry sky and a fiery meteor rocketing in from above. The castle is filled with armored soldiers, and atop its highest tower stands a male human figure in a long coat, either welcoming or summoning the meteor.
^017

The gate is typically barred from the inside. The yard within the gated wall is a small patch of grass and a wide stretch of pebbly beach lining the cold shore of Highstar Lake. The fortress does little to disrupt the winds and chill coming off the lake. This yard's primary purpose is to provide a small patch of ground where supplicants can camp and petition Tyreus—or pledge fealty to him.

The waters here hide or once hid the Stone of Creation.

### 2. Central Guard Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This spare, simple tower feels new and somehow rote. It looks sturdy but bland, built without any adornment or decorations. It serves a purpose but has nothing to say.
^019

Tyreus hardly gave this tower a second thought when he conjured the fortress. He imagined it as a place for half-real guards to look out over the lakeshore gate in an endless vigil—and that is all it is.

#### Ground Floor

Other than the stairs leading up to the rest of this tower, this chamber holds only a barrel for collecting rainwater. It has no arrow loops or other openings for looking outside the fortress.

#### Second Floor

This spare, bare chamber squints out at the world through narrow arrow loops.

#### Third Floor

The taller windows in this area allow views of the outside world. Doorways open onto the crenelated battlements atop the fortress walls here, too.

#### Roof

This level is little more than the stone ceiling of the level below, ringed by a crenelated wall to provide easy cover to guards overseeing the lakeshore gate or surrounding countryside.

### 3. Southern Guard Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Another basic tower of solid construction. It smells like fresh mortar, lake water, and the body odors and boiled dinners of the mercenaries camped here.
^020

The mercenaries of the Iron Lion flag have made this tower their camp. They've made themselves comfortable but do not show much respect for the place.

#### Ground Floor

Accessible primarily via the stairs from the second floor, this space is intended as a refuge for guests or a storage area for their supplies and equipment. A door, latched from the inside only, leads out to the lakeshore.

#### Second Floor

Stairs lead up from the lakeshore yard, hug the inner wall, and let out here on the second floor, which has been turned into a recreational area for mercenaries.

#### Third Floor

This floor now serves as the personal quarters and command post of the mercenary leader, Gollis (male human, neutral evil, [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)). He keeps the room a bit of a mess, anchored by a large table to which he has a map of the High Moors pinned down with daggers. Doors lead from this room to the central guard tower and the southern arched walkway.

#### Roof

Low battlement walls surround an empty roof overlooking the green hills of the High Moors and the steely waters of the lake.

### 4. Northern Guard Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Another basic tower of solid construction. Aside from the smell of fresh mortar, the air tastes like cinnamon branches.
^027

Audra's mercenaries, under her Banner of Blades, reside here for now. They conduct an orderly, regimented existence here, using cinnamon branches and incense to add comfort without diminishing their military orderliness.

#### Ground Floor

Accessible primarily via the stairs from the second floor, this space is intended as a refuge for guests or a storage area for their supplies and equipment. Audra's mercenaries sleep here. A door, latched from the inside only, leads out to the lakeshore.

#### Second Floor

Stairs clinging to the inner wall of the fortress lead here from the yard below. This floor serves as the gathering area for mercenaries from Audra's company; they leave someone here most of the time to watch for trouble.

#### Third Floor

Audra (female half-elf, lawful evil, [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) claimed this floor for herself. She sleeps and reads here but meets with her people downstairs. This chamber is comfortable enough, with piles of furs as a bed and half a dozen history books stacked by a deep leather chair, where she studies and plans. This floor exits onto walkways leading toward the central guard tower and the northern arched walkway.

#### Roof

This crenelated roof is bare but offers a grand view of the surrounding highlands and the crisp waves of Highstar Lake.

### 5. Arched Walkways

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> High winds whistle through this area. The glittering lake ebbs below.
^02e

Up here, winds are often powerful enough to impose disadvantage on ranged attacks. The low guarding walls on each side of the walkway are only 3 feet tall, offering little protection for travelers along this path. (Tyreus wants people to feel precarious on their way to visit him.)

### 6. Northern Turret

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This curious architectural feature appears to have been left unguarded. Much of the floor is made up of an iron grate, through which you can see the waves of the lake dozens of feet below.
^030

This hanging turret, like its counterpart, is meant to appear as an architectural flourish but is also part of Tyreus's defenses against intrusion by creatures on foot.

#### Ground Floor

This tower has no ground floor. It is part of the arched northern wall of the fortress, conjured into existence by Tyreus, and suspended above the lake. The bottom of this tower is about 20 feet above the water.

#### Second Floor

This empty chamber is open to the lake below.

#### Third Floor

This area is an overlook and a checkpoint, designed by Tyreus to harm intruders and alert him of approaching threats. It has no ceiling and is open to the air, allowing air elementals to reach it with ease. The floor of this area includes a wide, metal grate that can be opened to create a pit into the lake below; the switch is by the doorway on the keep's side of the room.

The third floor's eastern doorway is trapped with a glyph of warding's explosive runes and a linked glyph connected to an alarm glyph (DC 18 to detect both); the effect glyph for the alarm is in Tyreus's sanctum (area 10). The glyphs respond to any creature that does not say the password "visionary" before passing through the doorway. If [Tyreus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tyreus-illusionist-aitfr-fcd.md) is alerted to an intruder, he prepares for combat as described in his entry in appendix A. For more about [linked glyphs](Mechanics/spells/linked-glyphs-aitfr-avt.md), see appendix B.

### 7. Southern Turret

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The unusual turret appears empty. Much of the floor is little more than an iron grate, with the lake's waves ebbing dozens of feet below.
^036

This hanging turret, like its counterpart, is meant to appear as an architectural flourish but is also part of Tyreus's defenses against intrusion by creatures on foot.

#### Ground Floor

This tower has no ground floor. It is part of the arched northern wall of the fortress, conjured into existence by Tyreus, and suspended above the lake. The bottom of this tower is about 20 feet above the water.

#### Second Floor

This empty chamber is open to the lake below.

#### Third Floor

This area is an overlook and a checkpoint, designed by Tyreus to harm intruders and alert him of approaching threats. It has no ceiling and is open to the air, allowing air elementals to reach it with ease. The floor of this area includes a wide, metal grate that can be opened to create a pit into the lake below; the switch is by the doorway on the keep's side of the room.

The third floor's eastern doorway is trapped with a glyph of warding's explosive runes and a linked glyph connected to an alarm glyph (DC 18 to detect both); the effect glyph for the alarm is in Tyreus's sanctum (area 10). The glyphs respond to any creature that does not say the password "visionary" before passing through the doorway. If [Tyreus](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tyreus-illusionist-aitfr-fcd.md) is alerted to an intruder, he prepares for combat as described in his entry in appendix A. For more about [linked glyphs](Mechanics/spells/linked-glyphs-aitfr-avt.md), see appendix B.

### 8. Cellar Vault

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This arched chamber of stone feels less like a cellar and more like a vault, with barrels full of coins and precious gold and silver wares piled up carelessly in the corner. A large landscape painting of the lake rests atop the heap.
^03c

The double doors in the eastern wall are blocked by the stone of the outer wall, which Tyreus can reshape using the keystone or other magical means when he likes. Tyreus intends this room to be storage for treasures and supplies collected from those paying tribute to him. Aside from a table and a scale for weighing treasure, the room contains treasures and traps.

The keystone for this fortress is fitted into the arched ceiling here, 10 feet above the ground.

#### Traps

Two magical glyphs are hidden in the floor in the center of this room (DC 18 to detect them both) and keyed to activate if anyone but Tyreus or the fortress's mystical servants touches the 10-foot area in the center of the room. The first is an alarm glyph from a linked glyph spell; its effect glyph is located in Tyreus's sanctum. The second glyph is a spell glyph that casts [wall of force](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-force.md) to create a dome over intruders, theoretically trapping intruders and buying Tyreus or his minions time to arrive. The wall of force's dome covers a circle with a 10-foot radius out from the center of the room.

#### Treasure

A hoard of coins that Tyreus has looted over the years, now intended for current and future mercenaries, are kept in a pair of kegs here. One keg holds 7,090 gp in assorted coins, the other holds 7,120 gp worth of coins. Assorted art objects (worth 3,200 gp) sit in a heap in the northwest corner, capped by a landscape painting of Highstar Lake painted years ago by Saraque Skyhill (worth 800 gp).

The [Stone of Creation](Mechanics/items/stone-of-creation-aitfr-avt.md) has been recovered by Tyreus and is here, set upon a clean bronze brazier at one end of the room, near the doors.

### 9. Wizard's Residence

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This lavish room is softened by velvet curtains and colorful wall hangings, including what seems to be a banner ornately stitched with a golden letter T. The ceiling's timber rafters are hung with sweet-smelling dried herbs. A portrait hangs above the fireplace, showing a kingly white human with an exquisitely trimmed white beard and a cobalt blue coat. He wears a silver crown.
^041

Tyreus keeps a tidy but plush residence, with lush tapestries, soft rugs, velvet curtains, and a large round bed, all summoned into existence as part of the fortress. The portait over the fireplace is of Tyreus himself. It depicts him as he wishes to be in ten or twenty years. Nothing of actual value is here aside from a book of arcane history he stole from another wizard's library.

### 10. Sanctum

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Big, wooden tables with metal legs dominate the room. Each boasts complex collections of glass instruments and silvery lab equipment, for studying arcane things, perhaps, but the room is sparkling clean and has no smell.
^043

This room is meant as a sanctum and laboratory, but Tyreus has hardly put it to use. The scales, graduated glass objects, and other lab equipment are pristine—all conjured up as part of the fortress.

#### Treasure

A [chip of creation](Mechanics/items/chip-of-creation-aitfr-avt.md) sits on a wooden plate under a glass lid here.

### 11. Study

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Hulking, hardwood bookshelves line the walls here, teeming with tomes boasting colorful, pristine spines. Layers of soft carpets lay between them, capped with a plush leather reading chair and a wide, square table scattered with more books. Despite all this, the room has no smell.
^047

Every book on the shelves is blank, conjured up by Tyreus when he imagined this place.

#### Treasure

The books stacked on the floor and scattered on the table were all looted from other wizards' collections. They include speculations on the origins and location of the [Stone of Creation](Mechanics/items/stone-of-creation-aitfr-avt.md) as well as the sigil combinations for various teleportation circles (in locations of the DM's choosing). One of them is a [spellbook](Mechanics/items/spellbook.md) containing the spells [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md), [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md), [stone shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md), [stoneskin](Mechanics/spells/stoneskin.md), and [wall of stone](Mechanics/spells/wall-of-stone.md). The historical and arcane texts are worth a total of 2,250 gp to the right collectors.

### 12. Meeting Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long dining table dominates the room, framed by a huge fireplace at one end. Above the fireplace, a taxidermy head of a blue dragon is frozen in mid-snarl; its eyes seem to be diamonds. The dark table is decorated with a cobalt-blue runner, and a sideboard gleams with golden cups on a golden tray, next to a decanter of darkred wine. The table is set with six low chairs and a single, high-backed chair at the head, near the fireplace.
^04b

Here Tyreus meets with the mercenary commanders and any other visitors he deigns to entertain—or impress. The long table seats three to each long side; the high-backed chair at the head of the table is for Tyreus. The dragon's head, the cups, the tray, the wine, everything is part of the conjured fortress and has no real value.

### 13. Observatory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This place is almost empty save for a shiny telescope and a small iron chest near a wide, open window looking west over the lake. A heavy, stone throne made of black slate marbled with gold and platinum stands in the center of the room. A circle of sigils is carved in the floor. Natural light filters in through high windows and airshafts in the ceiling. The ceiling itself is vaulted stone and timber rafters.
^04d

Even Tyreus isn't sure what this room is for other than adding height to the keep and looking out at the stars of Faerûn. The circle of sigils is a place for Tyreus to cast [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md)ation circle and other spells but is not an active or permanent magical feature.

The throne quietly serves two purposes: first, to aggrandize Tyreus, and second, to make visitors think he has mastered the Stone of Creation and made it his own. The throne, of course, is not magical at all—it is another conjured part of Tyreus's fantasy castle.

If he can, Tyreus attempts to intimidate (or even combat) intruders here.

#### Treasure

The telescope is worth 250 gp. The iron chest is unlocked and contains a crystal decanter of brandy from Waterdeep and a single glass tumbler. The brandy and the chest are genuine; everything crystal or glass in the chest is part of the fortress.
