# Part 1: The Outer Lair
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night, p. 4* 

The adventure begins when the adventurers first lay eyes on the mysterious hill they seek, 110 miles southeast of the fork in the Delimbiyr River. There they find a high, irregular hill with a crack in its side like a wound.

If you choose to play out the journey to this spot, take special note of the regional effects of [Kyrilla's lair](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kyrilla-accursed-gorgon-aitfr-dn.md), described in appendix A.

## 1. Cleft in the Rock

> Though fog shrouds everything here, it's easy to recognize the huge, dome-like mound of earth and the great, dark cleft in its western edge. The domed hill must be more than sixty feet high, and the crack cuts half that high. A few tall boulders have fallen into the cleft—though the hill is so grassy and clear otherwise, those boulders look more like they've been placed there.

This is the place. The tall boulders are Medium-sized stones, each about 1,000 pounds, set in place by the galeb duhrs in area 2. They're meant to discourage trespassers and protect the statue that blocks the way into area 4. A creature that is Small or smaller can squeeze between the boulders to see into area 4, but it is difficult terrain all the way.

## 2. Boulder Trio

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Three squat boulders are here amid the long grasses and shallow water of the moor. Each is spotted with lichen and patches of rich, dark moss. They're arranged on the ground as if they are the points of a triangle.
^00d

The ground here is littered with small, lifeless rocks amid windswept grasses. The three largest boulders are actually a trio of galeb duhrs quietly contemplating the countryside—and now, the adventurers. They came along after Sylvene's and Hamish's adventuring party fled the site, then animated boulders into area 4 to protect that area from later trespassers. Since then, the galeb duhrs have wandered the area slowly, returning to this place every twenty years or so to see what has changed. They've been sitting here for almost five years on this visit.

These elementals aren't looking for a fight. They'd love to hear a good story, though, if it isn't told too fast. If the adventurers talk openly about needing access to the cleft in the rock and do not seem to have villainous intent, the galeb duhrs animate the boulders out of their way. The elementals then stick around for a week waiting for the adventurers to emerge from the lair and leave before resealing the lair. The galeb duhrs become dismayed with (and thus bored of) the adventurers if they ignore or damage the statue of Hamish in area 4. While dismayed, they sit motionless and silent in the grass, stubbornly waiting for the adventurers to leave, then reseal the lair.

## 3. Abandoned Altar

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Carved into the hillside here is a ten-foot-high alcove of simple stones, framing a low stone altar. It might've been ornate once, but years of weather have smoothed its features. A wide, table-like slab of stone stands on four short supports carved like serpents. The ground under the altar is loose gravel atop a wide stone base.

This altar was built by yuan-ti from the Serpent Kingdom, southeast of here. For a time, the cultists used the altar to perform ceremonies invoking the spirits of dead yuan-ti inside the structure below, but the cultists haven't been back in years. Their magic created the skeletal horrors inside the lair but could not control them.

The altar is made of four stout columns (150 pounds each) and a slab (400 pounds), all standing on a single 250-pound boulder, still under the gravel beneath the altar. That boulder caps a natural fissure in the ground which the yuan-ti cultists used to access the inner lair. If the altar and the boulder beneath it are moved, a 5-foot-diameter tunnel is revealed. It leads to area 7 inside the lair.
