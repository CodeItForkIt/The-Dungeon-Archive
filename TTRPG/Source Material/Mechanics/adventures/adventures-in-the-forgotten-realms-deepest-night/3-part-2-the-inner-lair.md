# Part 2: The Inner Lair
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night, p. 5* 

The colossal sphere that is now Kyrilla's lair was meant to traverse various planes of existence for decades, until someone could decide what to do with the Stone of Creation. The idea was to use an extradimensional space conjured by Kyrilla's keystone of creation to feed and house Kyrilla and Kathikon. They would navigate the well shaft using [levitate](Mechanics/spells/levitate.md) spells—to which Kyrilla no longer has access. Almost nothing went as hoped.

## General Features

The interior of Kyrilla's lair was meant to hold the Stone of Creation in a copper grip at its center, to protect it from people—and people from it. Now, the encasing shell of the Stone is a prison for Kyrilla.

The sphere's meteoric arrival left this whole place almost exactly upside down. Iron sconces and hooks for tapestries are all upside down, relative to the current layout. The panoramic mural and various carved details at what is now the top of the well shaft also appear upside down.

### Construction

None of this was built; all of it was conjured, either by distant mages' spells or by forgotten powers of the Stone itself. Individual stones and mortar were never set in place by hand. The whole place has a cold orderliness to it, made uneven by the passage of time. Water seeping into this place over thousands of years has been [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by the stone shell—and by Kyrilla's curse.

### Light

No natural light makes it into the lair. The creatures that dwell here reside in almost total darkness most of the time. Whatever light the adventurers bring is what they have.

### Sound

Despite any mundane acoustical properties, the inside of Kyrilla's lair feels eerily quiet. Even the sounds of a battle seem strangely muted. Movement. The following effects apply to areas 4, 5, 6, and 7:

- The angled floors make these areas difficult terrain for any creature on the ground that is not climbing. No check is necessary to climb in these areas under normal circumstances.  
- A creature that takes the [Dash](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dash) action can make a DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to ignore the effects of difficult terrain until the start of its next turn. Make the check at the start of the creature's movement.  
- A creature without a climbing speed that takes damage while on the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the damage it takes; if it fails the save, it loses its footing.  
- A creature that is knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid losing its footing.  

### Lost Footing

A creature that loses its footing is knocked [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) and tumbles downhill until it reaches an occupied space or the edge of the area where it lost its footing. There, it either stops (if it hits a barrier like a wall) or it may make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to catch itself on the edge of the area; otherwise it falls into the next adjacent area.

## The Conjured Areas

Areas 8, 9, 10, and 11 were all conjured through the power of a keystone of creation to which Kyrilla is attuned. She created them in a time of fury and despair, resulting in their warped and strained appearances. Where these areas come into contact with the surrounding stone—whether it is the sphere or the ground itself—the conjured surfaces appear like they were hardened in mid-pour or frozen while rippling.

All these areas dissolve harmlessly into rock dust and smoke if Kyrilla's linked keystone becomes inert.

## Kyrilla's Tactics

Kyrilla has been corrupted by her gods and twisted by the pains she has endured, but she has no desire to die and little hope that she can ever be pardoned by the distant powers that cursed her. She attempts to put arrows into intruders from as far away as possible. She hides, moves, and strikes as needed. She will sic snakes and skeletal horrors on her enemies as she can in hopes that intruders either flee or are slain. If she thinks she's near defeat, she flees through the arcane doorway in area 11 and into area 12.

She has little interest in using her gaze and keeping the adventurers around as statues, forever haunting her. It is her least favorite weapon. The gaze embodies her curse—and it killed Kathikon (whose statue is in area 12). Of course, she cannot control it and isn't willing to surrender, only triumph or die.

After a day or so, Kyrilla usually commands her monstrous minions to destroy the [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) remains of trespassers so she does not have to see them anymore.

> [!note] Too Many Foes
> 
> The encounters within the lair can be formidable—even deadly—if allowed to spill over into each other. This is not an easy dungeon to retreat from! If the players go slow and work together, they'll probably have better luck. If the adventurers get in over their heads, one or more of the galeb duhrs outside might come to help them, with hopes of dispelling the effects of Kyrilla's lair on the surrounding lands.

## 4. At the Threshold

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cleft is little more than a fracture in the stone underneath the turf of the hillside. It's tall and narrow and might be easily traversed at ground level if not for half a dozen six-foot-tall boulders set into the cleft now, almost like they're neatly queued up to go inside.
^01b

The galeb duhrs in area 2 animated six Medium-sized boulders into position here to seal off the cleft in hopes of keeping idle trespassers out—and thereby protecting the statue beyond, if they could. If four Medium-sized boulders are removed from the cleft, enough smaller rocks fall loose to allow Medium-sized creatures to reach the interior of the passage.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The cleft shrinks to become a recessed passage leading into the hillside beneath a rough ceiling of rock. At the end of that natural passage is a huge, humanoid statue made of stone, with its back to you.
^01c

This area is dimly lit from natural light.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The statue leans against a huge stone slab, as though holding it in place; its hands even grip the stone with perfect precision. The giant depicted in the statue is fully detailed with a backpack, finely wrought hair, a coil of rope, laced boots—all rendered sharply from a single stone. He's positioned near the only gap around the slab, just a foot or so wide, and seems to peer through it.
^01d

The statue, of course, is the [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) form of [Hamish Hewland](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/hamish-hewland-aitfr-dn.md) (see appendix A), the giant who accompanied Sylvene, Waltarn, and Artura here more than 50 years ago. Hamish tried to reseal the lair but caught sight of Kathikon on the other side just as he was fixing the slab into position. Kathikon was satisfied to leave Hamish there, holding the slab in place, in hopes that it would slow or thwart future visitors.

Hamish's round, wooden shield—big enough for a giant—is still propped up near the statue's feet, but it has rotted beyond practical use.

If restored to life with a [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic, Hamish comes back to life with a gasp. As far as Hamish is concerned, he had been fleeing the dark well beyond, alongside his adventuring peers, just moments ago. He realized he was being [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) for one fleeting moment, then he was unthinking stone. Hamish was down to 11 hit points when he was [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified).

Hamish is willing to help the adventurers if he believes their intentions are good. He shares any lore he knows from the section "Hamish's Tale," if he thinks it won't get people needlessly hurt. He wants to avoid descending the well shaft, or venturing beyond, after his last experience in there. He's happy to help with climbing gear, provide light, and otherwise be of use.

## 5. A Deep, Dark Well

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This dark, squared well shaft descends into the earthen darkness at a steep angle, as if bored out of the rock itself. Three long, hefty, coppery poles jut at even intervals from the walls of the shaft, almost meeting in the center, and each one ends in an empty clamp or claw. If they held something once, it would have been suspended at the center of the shaft.
^01f

The top of this chamber was meant to be the floor when the structure was made. The walls at that end of the structure are etched with deep carvings of humanoid figures of many races, all of them with heads upturned and arms outstretched toward their sky as if basking or reveling. Behind them, a depiction of a long wall of tall towers and spiked battlements runs all along the well shaft. The only break in the ring of people features a carved set of double doors in the depiction of the wall—but it is only a picture. (This was intended to be the location of the mystic door now located in area 11.)

The floor at the feet of the carved figures is dominated by a silver disc almost 10 feet in diameter, etched with sigils and symbols in concentric circles and anchored by a short, iron pedestal and a simple mounting bracket designed to hold something that is no longer there. (It was made to hold the tuning fork that is now located in area 10.)

Irregularities in the rock walls, plus a variety of hooks and sconces (all upside down), make it easy to secure ropes and other climbing gear throughout the well shaft. The copper arms sticking out of the walls once grasped the Stone of Creation. Their clamping grippers were bent and mangled when ancient intruders stole the stone centuries ago and are still misshapen. The arms themselves were designed to support almost 1,000 pounds and are still strong.

Three original chambers extend off this center well shaft: areas 4, 6, and 7.

What is now the bottom of the shaft has fallen into the ground and become part of the physical construction made by Kyrilla and Kathikon using one of the keystones. The drop from area 5 to the floor of area 8 is a distance of 30 feet.

A [giant zombie constrictor snake](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/giant-zombie-constrictor-snake-aitfr-dn.md) (see appendix A) clings comfortably to this chamber, nestled into an angle where walls meet the floor. It came from area 6.

### Treasure

The silver seal in the floor is mostly iron under a layer of silver leaf worth 525 gp. Etched into it is an inscription in a rare dialect of Primordial, explaining lore about the Stone of Creation and its lesser artifacts—whatever lore you may want to convey to bring your players and their characters up to speed—and the names of Kyrilla and Kathikon, who were meant to be guardians of the artifacts.

## 6. Giant Snake Den

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor angles away from you, down to a section of wall that bristles with snagged and cast-off scales and piled dry refuse and remains, collected over hundreds of years.
^022

This is where the giant zombie constrictors usually wait out eternity. Unless it has been drawn out by sounds of battle, a second giant undead constrictor snake is coiled here.

### Treasure

Among the detritus and remains at the back of the chamber are a ruby-studded bracer (90 gp), four golden rings (30 gp each), and a silver circlet (45 gp), all leftover from yuan-ti cultists devoured years ago.

## 7. Lost Bones

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This angled chamber is home to a pile of yellowed, rotten bones large enough to be human or similar. The angle of the room has caused all the bones to heap in one corner. Lots of slender rib bones suggest serpentine bodies or copious humanoid ribcages. Snake-like skulls—each the size of a human's or a dwarf's—peer out from the pile. They all look to be caught in place by the rough walls and whatever gore once clung to the bones—but they look like they could fall toward you at any moment.
^026

The mass of bones clinging in place here is the body of a [skeletal horror](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeletal-horror-aitfr-dn.md) (see appendix A). It has braced itself into position to await intruders and attacks when living creatures investigate its bones or attempt to leave the area—even if they disturb nothing. It is unmoved by the sights or sounds of battle in the well shaft.

Centuries ago, yuan-ti cultists slipped into the lair and arrived in this chamber. They closed up the tunnel when they left the site for good, capping that tunnel with the boulder and the altar at area 3.

Any treasures taken from the bodies of the yuan-ti whose bones make up this skeletal horror are now at the bottom of the poison pool in area 8.

## 8. Poison Pool

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor here is hidden in a dark-red liquid with the consistency of thin mud. Something like algae clouds it, too. A musty, slightly sweet pond-scum smell fills the air.
^028

This foul liquid combines all the fluids that have ebbed, flowed, or been bled into the lair over time. Most of it is rain and groundwater that have seeped in but all of it has become a gruesome and powerful poison through the accursed power of Kyrilla's lair.

The poison pool is 2 feet deep and difficult terrain. The bottom of it is covered in broken pieces of statues made from yuan-ti cultists she [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) and then had destroyed.

A living creature whose eyes, nose, ears, or mouth are submerged in the poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, suffering 11 (`2d10`) poison damage if it fails, or half as much if it succeeds. A creature that starts its turn submerged repeats the saving throw.

A creature that drinks a mouthful of the poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.

The pool also hides a mass of bones that are actually the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) body of another skeletal horror. Merely disturbing the pool isn't enough to stir its attention; it waits until living flesh touches the pool—or when Kyrilla commands it—then rises to attack intruders.

### Treasure

Near the northern edge of the poison pool, amid loose rocks on the ground, is a [brooch of shielding](Mechanics/items/brooch-of-shielding.md). It is all that remains of an emissary from the Serpent Kingdoms. Also, Kyrilla's keystones are set into the floor at the center of the poison pool.

## 9. Abandoned Chambers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is eerily empty. A layer of rock dust and stray earth blankets the space. Nothing has moved through this area in a long, long time.
^02c

These rooms were meant to be part of Kyrilla's and Kathikon's living space in this ornate prison, but as they fell into rote habits, they wandered their own spaces less and less.

## 10. Rotting Ceremonial Chamber

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A simple stone chair is the only furniture in this colorful room. It stands in the center of the space, beneath the peak of a vaulted ceiling. The walls are hung with once-lavish, rotting silks and abstract tapestries. The vaulted ceiling is painted with a flaking mural across four sections, portraying a tale of humanoid figures and a black slab of stone marbled with gold. From the ceiling where the four sections join, someone has hung a single metal chime on a simple cord.
^02e

This area received all of Kyrilla's attention when she conjured the place with her keystone of creation. She created the ceiling's mural from memory and saved the chime after it fell from a wall during the sphere's arrival in Faerûn. There used to be five of them, hung from the walls at the base of the well shaft.

The ceiling depicts four pieces of lore about the Stone of Creation:

- First, the Stone was placed inside the sphere, depicted by three wizards raising it magically into the grip of the three copper arms while a white male human and a green-skinned gorgon look on.  
- Second, the Stone is carried away by tall figures, possibly giants, as depicted by figures that make the human and the gorgon look small by comparison. They appear to be carrying the stone to a lake or inland sea.  
- Third, the human and the gorgon are struck by a curse depicted as green flames that surround their bodies and replace their eyes.  
- Fourth, the Stone is shown breaking into pieces by lightning, fire, and wind where a simple silver tuning fork touches it. Beneath it, towers turn to smoke.  

### Treasure

The chime, like its siblings, plays precisely the frequency needed to plane shift into the Elemental Chaos. The chime is not magical.

> [!note] Tuning Chaos
> 
> The instruments tuned to the arcane frequency of the Elemental Chaos can be used in at least two ways. First, the chimes can be used to create components for a [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) spell leading to the tumultuous Elemental Chaos—components like the tuning fork itself, which is already crafted for such a purpose. Second, the fork (or another of its kind tuned to the Elemental Chaos) can be used to destroy the [Stone of Creation](Mechanics/items/stone-of-creation-aitfr-avt.md) or its related artifacts, as described in appendix B.

## 11. Magic Door

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air buzzes and thrums. A five-foot-wide doorway swirls with dull light here, seemingly leading into the stone wall beyond, though its arcane glow hides whatever is on the other side.
^033

This area holds only the mystical door that leads to Kyrilla's extradimensional refuge.
