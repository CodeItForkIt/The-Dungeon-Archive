- [Giant Zombie Constrictor Snake](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/giant-zombie-constrictor-snake-aitfr-dn.md)  
- [Hamish Hewland](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/hamish-hewland-aitfr-dn.md)  
- [Kyrilla the Accursed](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kyrilla-accursed-gorgon-aitfr-dn.md)

> [!note] The Only Hope?
> 
> Perhaps there is one way to inspire Kyrilla to hope: Introduce her to a restored Hamish and let her see that life might exist beyond the effects of her curse. If the adventurers restore Kathikon to flesh and blood, Kyrilla could be so moved as to break her attunement to her keystones and share everything about the ceremonial chamber, its chime, and the tuning fork, as described in the sidebar "Tuning Chaos." Destroying the Stone of Creation could even end the curse on Kyrilla and Kathikon!
> 
> If you need statistics for Kathikon, use Kyrilla's.
