# Part 4: What's Next
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night, p. 10* 

The adventurers have new information and, perhaps, everything they need to confront Tyreus and decide what fate shall befall the artifact he seeks. The final adventure in this series likely brings the players to the edge of Highstar Lake in the High Moors to deal with Tyreus and the Stone of Creation as they see fit, using what they've learned or recovered from Kyrilla's lair.
