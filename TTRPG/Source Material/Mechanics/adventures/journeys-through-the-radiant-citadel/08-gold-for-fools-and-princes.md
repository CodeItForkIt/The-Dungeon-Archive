# Gold for Fools and Princes
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 92* 

*An Adventure for 7th-Level Characters*

A tunnel collapse traps miners deep within the Goldwarren, the great mine complex of the city-state of Anisa. But even more concerning, a survivor of the disaster reports being attacked by a creature thought to be long extinct. The characters must aid in rescuing the miners, but to do so they'll have to work alongside the rivals [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) and [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md)—both of whom see the disaster as a way to influence their chances of claiming the imperial throne.

## Background

The three city-states of the Sensa Empire—Anisa, Niba, and Tarikh—compete for Empress Inaya's favor, hoping the empress will choose her heir from among their own royal families. This competition plays out in the cities' gold mines as each city vies for wealth and economic influence. But the Aurum Guild, to which most of the miners belong, holds great power over the city-states as the source of their wealth. Any young royal seeking consideration as the empress's heir must court the guild's favor.

The mines of Anisa, known as the Goldwarren, are extraordinarily efficient, but yesterday a tunnel collapsed, trapping seven miners inside. Amid efforts to reopen the mine entrance, a survivor claims to have seen a bizarre, many-limbed monster.

King Diara of Anisa has sent his eldest son, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md), to take charge of the rescue mission. Diara hopes to raise Simbon's profile, thus gaining the empress's attention and securing Simbon as her successor. Unfortunately, the Aurum Guild favors [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) of Niba as its candidate for imperial heir, and he's intent on aiding the rescue mission.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize the Sensa Empire in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters who visit Sensa by traveling through the Radiant Citadel arrive near the city of Anisa. Use the "Sensa Empire Gazetteer" section to further detail the region.  
- **Eberron.** At a distant edge of the Menechtarun Desert on Xen'drik, Sensa could be a secluded oasis of peace amid the famously dangerous continent.  
- **Forgotten Realms.** The Sensa Empire might lie near to or within the desert of Anauroch. If placed at the edge of the great desert, it could be a rich trade partner to surrounding lands. If hidden deeper within, it might be a land of near-legend.  

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Business Call.** A character knows Uzoma, overseer of the Goldwarren, personally or through business dealings at the Radiant Citadel. She invites the characters to Anisa to discuss a trade opportunity, but a mine collapse occurs just before they arrive.  
- **Imperiled Experts.** The people of the Sensa Empire are famed as goldsmiths and jewelers. If the characters need a valuable object appraised or repaired, the Aurum Guild of Sensa can provide peerless experts. When the characters seek them out, they're distracted by a calamity.  
- **Royal Attendants.** King Diara of Anisa has heard about the characters and hopes they might guide his directionless son [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md). When the characters arrive, the king asks the characters to help Simbon resolve the Goldwarren disaster.  

## Starting the Adventure

![Prince Kirina fends off an...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/059-07-001.twilight-dune-scorpions.webp#center "Prince Kirina fends off an attack by twilight dune scorpions")

After arriving in Anisa, the characters overhear that the city's famed gold mine, the Goldwarren, has collapsed. Nearby, people are gathering to hear news of the missing miners, and two local princes will be speaking. Characters who ask questions about the situation among the gathered people can learn the following information:

- The Goldwarren is Anisa's famous gold mine. It's run by a group called the Aurum Guild.  
- At least seven miners are trapped in the mine.  
- [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md), the son of Anisa's king, is not widely respected in the empire.  
- [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) comes from the neighboring city of Niba. He's a charismatic figure who's well-liked by the Aurum Guild.  

Feel free to supplement this information with any details you wish to share about Anisa or the Aurum Guild from the "Sensa Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure.

### Rival Princes

When the characters arrive at the square, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Locals crowd a shaded square, listening to a fervent argument between two well-dressed human men wearing dark colors and gold jewelry.
> 
> "This isn't your place, [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md)!" one man shouts. "This isn't your city! The trapped miners are my responsibility. As soon as the entrance is cleared—"
> 
> "But these are my people!" Kirina interrupts. "I value the friendship of the Aurum Guild, and I stand with my friends in their time of need. But don't worry, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md). We can find something safe for you to do while we bring our missing family home."
^1fd

Voices in the crowd rise as they declare support for one prince or the other. Most of the folk wearing the grimy tunics of miners are impressed when Kirina speaks, while the Anisan city folk shout agreement when Simbon speaks. As the debate continues, a muscular dwarf miner carrying a polished copper pick approaches the characters. This is Uzoma, the overseer at the Goldwarren.

#### Overseer Uzoma

[Uzoma Baten](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/uzoma-baten-jttrc.md) (lawful good, dwarf [guard](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) was selected as the Goldwarren's overseer due to her compassion and diligence. She sees this position as the highest possible honor and strives daily to be worthy as she labors alongside her fellow miners. Determined to do right by them, Uzoma doesn't hesitate to challenge orders she deems unfair—even if those orders come directly from King Diara.

##### Personality Trait

"I'm happiest when I'm working with my hands."

##### Ideal

"Though I might have more responsibility, I'm no better than anyone else who works in the Goldwarren."

##### Bond

"I would die to protect the miners of the Goldwarren."

##### Flaw

"I have to prove that I deserve my position."

### Meeting Uzoma

Uzoma bluntly notes that she's looking for adventurers. She hopes to hire the characters to head into the mine and rescue the trapped miners, offering 300 gp to each character.

Uzoma also fills the characters in on the tension in the crowd:

- The folk of the Sensa Empire are loyal to the empress and their own city-states in equal measure. As such, most folk of Anisa favor [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) as the would-be heir to Empress Inaya.  
- The Aurum Guild has thrown its support behind the more adventurous [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) of Niba, so many of the miners in the crowd favor him.  
- Simbon has technically been given charge of the rescue mission by his father, King Diara. However, the prince seems rattled by the responsibility.  
- Kirina has been in the city on private business for weeks, but he made a very public appearance after the accident at the mine. He's taken it on himself to volunteer for the rescue mission.  

Once the characters agree to the mission, or if they want to learn more before signing on, Uzoma says she has someone she wants them to meet—a young miner who saw monsters in the mine before making his escape. She motions for the characters to follow her through the crowd.

### Princes and Scorpions

As Uzoma leads the characters through the crowd, they notice movement in the shadows across the street. Read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shouts ring out at the crowd's edge as massive, glowing scorpions rush from a shadowed alley. [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) draws a sword and races forward, while [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) hesitates before following.
^205

The crowd flees, leaving only the characters and the princes to face five [giant scorpions](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md). Uzoma stands back and watches as the encounter unfolds.

The princes are friendly toward the characters and are quick to ally with them. Both use the [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stat block, but they have only AC 11 and their Multiattack and Longsword actions. If a prince is reduced to half of his hit points or fewer, he uses the [Dodge](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dodge) action to avoid taking further damage.

The scorpions are hostile and of a rare, fluorescent breed known as twilight dune scorpions. Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check knows this and that the scorpions rarely venture from the deserts' depths.

The scorpions vanish when killed. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check realizes this is the mark of a magically summoned creature. A character familiar with conjuration magic recognizes that summoning giant scorpions in such numbers far exceeds the power of the [conjure animals](Mechanics/spells/conjure-animals.md) spell or other common magic.

In the aftermath of the battle, both princes thank the characters for their assistance.

#### Kirina, Prince of Niba

As the eldest son of the king of Niba, [Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) (chaotic evil, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) was raised knowing he might be named heir to the land's ruler, Empress Inaya. His childhood was filled with trips to her palace, the Azure Dome. In time, Kirina grew close to the empress. He came to see Inaya as a benevolent aunt, and his place as her heir seemed assured. Yet, as Kirina grew to adulthood, the empress didn't name him as her successor, a decision he came to resent.

Now, Kirina has made an alliance with the scheming High Priest Kedjou. They've used Kedjou's magical experiments to manufacture a calamity at the Goldwarren and to summon the giant scorpions. They plan to use these perils to establish Kirina as a hero in the eyes of the people and an obvious choice to be the empress's heir.

##### Personality Trait

"It's excusable to take abhorrent actions in pursuit of a higher goal."

##### Ideal

"Sometimes it's necessary to hurt those I love to accomplish my goals."

##### Bond

"I've devoted my entire life to becoming Empress Inaya's heir."

##### Flaw

"I'll stop at nothing to attain the throne."

#### Simbon, Prince of Anisa

[Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) (neutral, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) is loyal to Empress Inaya. His family seeks to ensure she chooses him as her heir, though he has never aspired to the position. But if one of Anisa's own were to rule the empire, it would be a point of pride for the whole land—so Simbon feels obligated to act as though he wants to be Empress Inaya's heir. In reality, Simbon believes his poor tactical mind and hedonistic bent make him a lackluster candidate.

##### Personality Trait

"I was raised to rule not only Anisa, but the entire Sensa Empire. Would that it were not so."

- **Ideal.** "If you can't be who they want you to be, the least you can do is fake it."  
- **Bond.** "I respect my father even as he grovels to the empress on my behalf."  
- **Flaw.** "I don't want the life I'm supposed to want."  

#### Searching the Alley

After the battle, characters who investigate the alley the scorpions originated from can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If they succeed, they find a partial series of smeared magical runes drawn on the alley wall. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows that the runes are related to conjuration magic but can tell nothing more.

## Death in the Mines

Soon after the giant scorpions are defeated, the crowd throngs [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) and [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md), lauding their heroics and asking what they'll do next. Uzoma ignores the chaos and, when the characters are ready, guides them to a young human at the crowd's edge whom she introduces as [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md)—a young miner who escaped the Goldwarren. At Uzoma's prompting, [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) shares the following story:

- [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) and the rest of his crew—including his mother—were working a new excavation when it collapsed.  
- [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) and the others were trying to escape when a snarling, eight-legged beast appeared.  
- The beast would've killed [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md), but his mother, Zihaya, defended him. The creature attacked her in turn and dragged her away.  
- In the chaos, [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) was separated from the others. He made his way to the entrance and was the last miner out before the entrance collapsed. No one else from his crew escaped.  

If pressed, [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) can detail the creature that attacked him further (see the "Aurumvoraxes" section at the end of this adventure). A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check recognizes the creature as an aurumvorax, a predator that eats precious metals but is thought to be extinct in the region.

After [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) shares his experience, Uzoma tells the characters how King Diara has been pushing to increase output at the mine to please Empress Inaya, excavating newer tunnels so quickly there's not time to fully reinforce them. The Aurum Guild has been warning of the potential for collapses within the mine, but has been ignored.

![Overseer Uzoma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/060-07-002.overseer-uzoma.webp#center)

### Next Steps

As the characters finish their conversation with [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md), shouting among the princes' supporters causes Uzoma to intervene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "That's enough! All this talk is wasting breath. The crews at the entrance should have it cleared and shored up by day's end. We'll sort out who's on the rescue team then. But for now..."
> 
> As Uzoma speaks, Kirina and Simbon both step up, interrupting her to announce they'll gladly take a place in the rescue party. Their followers begin arguing again until Uzoma blows a piercing whistle.
> 
> "If you want to help, stop arguing and do what I need you to do. [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md), you'll come to the Goldwarren with me. [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md), go find out what could be waiting for us in the mine. These adventurers will go with you. Let's get this done."
^210

Uzoma tasks Simbon and the characters with seeking out Kedjou, a high priest visiting Anisa Academy. Kedjou has a rich understanding of the Sensa Empire's history and might know what lurks in the mine. Even if the characters already suspect aurumvoraxes, Kedjou can relate more about their history and how they were once removed from the region.

#### To the Academy

[Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) escorts the characters to Anisa Academy, a ten-minute walk through the city. He's personable and speaks plainly, saying Kirina only seeks to make himself a hero to gain favor with the wealthy Aurum Guild. It's clear Simbon is frustrated, but characters who succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check recognize his complaints conceal jealousy of the well-liked rival prince.

## Anisa Academy

The campus of Anisa Academy consists of buildings clustered around a wide courtyard. It's crowded with students, professors, and Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet—the Sensa Empire's clergy—milling between buildings. As the party seeks out Kedjou, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) shares the following information:

- Kedjou has been in residence at the academy for only the past week. Visits from the high priest are rare.  
- According to Simbon's friends, the entire campus is abuzz with speculation that Kedjou came to the academy to conduct secret research.  

Finding Kedjou requires the characters to spend an hour asking around Anisa Academy or to succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check while engaging with academy faculty. They eventually learn that Kedjou has taken up offices on the top floor of the academy's library.

### Audience with the High Priest

![High Priest Kedjou](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/061-07-003.high-priest-kedjou.webp#center)

When Simbon and the characters arrive at the library, a librarian ushers the group to Kedjou's private room on the library's top floor. Outside, two [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stand alert. Within, open tomes and scrolls lie spread across several tables, and Kedjou makes no effort to hide any of his notes, haughtily assuming no adventurer riffraff will understand it. Behind a screen in the corner stands a bed, suggesting the room doubles as Kedjou's quarters.

#### High Priest Kedjou

[Kedjou Kamal](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kedjou-kamal-jttrc.md) (neutral evil, human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) was raised in an orphanage run by the Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet (detailed in the "Sensa Empire Gazetteer" section) and has long coveted power. As high priest, Kedjou does little to combat allegations of the Acolytes' corruption—and in fact, he's behind much of that corruption. He is single-mindedly focused on securing an advisory position to Empress Inaya's heir. This mission has brought him into a pact with Kirina, Prince of Niba. The prince has offered Kedjou the position the priest seeks if he helps Kirina take the throne.

#### Barbs and Beasts

Kedjou expresses delight at seeing [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) and respectfully greets the characters. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check sense animosity toward [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md). In the course of the conversation, Kedjou discreetly mocks the prince, going so far as to sympathize with Simbon about how straining it must be to busy himself among the common rabble or visit a library.

If told about the creatures in the mine, Kedjou believes the description matches that of monsters called aurumvoraxes, but he declares this is impossible as they're long extinct in the region. He can share the following details about the creatures:

- Aurumvoraxes are gold-eating predators that once claimed all the mines of the Sensa Empire as their territory. They were hunted down by Emperor Kassa a millennium ago. The creatures were eradicated from the region, and none have been seen since.  
- Kedjou doesn't believe [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md)'s story. If any of the creatures had survived the purge, their hunger for gold would have revealed the creatures long ago.  

If pressed to suggest what else might be in the mine, Kedjou flounders, then suggests it could be nothing more than overgrown rats.

#### Summoning Secrets

During the conversation with Kedjou, characters who have proficiency in the [Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion) skill catch sight of interesting details in the notes spread around the room. The notes suggest Kedjou is researching a unique conjuration spell. A character can steal a page from the notes by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. If they fail, the character still pockets the page but draws Kedjou's attention. The priest curtly declares he needs to get back to his studies and dismisses the group.

Any character who later spends at least 15 minutes investigating Kedjou's notes can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check. If the check succeeds, the character realizes the priest is investigating how to summon powerful creatures and cause them to linger for longer than usual.

#### Pushing Kedjou

Characters might challenge Kedjou on his animosity toward [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) or question whether the priest's research is related to the giant scorpions appearing in the city. Kedjou initially denies any such suggestions, but a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or suitable roleplaying convinces Kedjou to admit he dislikes Simbon. He believes that if Simbon wins the empress's favor and is named heir, it will be because of Anisa's wealth, not because Simbon deserves the position.

Despite this being said to his face, Simbon chuckles awkwardly and doesn't defend himself except to say that everyone's entitled to their opinion. Kedjou requests the characters leave soon after.

If pressed about the scorpions, Kedjou insists the characters leave, not wanting to reveal that he was involved in summoning the creatures and the aurumvoraxes in the Goldwarren—as the characters later discover.

If the characters refuse to leave when Kedjou requests, he summons his guards, who escort the party out of the building.

#### Support for Prince Simbon

After leaving the library, if a character asks Simbon about Kedjou's insults or assessments of his leadership potential, the prince tries to shrug it off. He also doesn't think much of his future as a leader. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can encourage Simbon to take his role as someone the people look up to more seriously. Doing so earns the characters Simbon's respect and influences the prince's willingness to speak out later in the adventure (see the "Beyond the Gold Warren" section).

### To the Goldwarren

Whatever the outcome of the encounter with Kedjou, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) suggests the group head to the Goldwarren, which lies a few hours north of Anisa. He doesn't relish the idea of venturing into the tunnels, but he truly wants to help those trapped within. He also hates the idea of Kirina starting the search effort without him.

Unless the characters have other pressing business in the city, Simbon calls for a coach to convey them there. He opposes any talk of breaking into Kedjou's quarters or harming the high priest, both of which would be scandals for Simbon's family.

## The Goldwarren

The Goldwarren's main entrance is wide enough for two carriages to drive through side by side; the mine then branches into a labyrinth of tunnels. When the party arrives at the Goldwarren, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Golden statues of royals smile down on visitors from atop the impressive, multistory entrance to the Goldwarren. While rubble spills from the open gates leading into the mines, a path has been cleared through it into darkness. Adjacent to the ornate entryway are several modest offices, bunkhouses, and workspaces.
^21b

A crowd gathers around the mine's huge entrance tunnel. Nearby, Uzoma and [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) watch as miners inspect the new posts shoring up the damaged tunnel. Uzoma welcomes the characters and asks them to enter the mine and find the missing miners. Both [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) and [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) plan to join the characters and won't be dissuaded.

Uzoma won't join the expedition but coordinates the rescue and rebuilding efforts; she notes that the missing miners should have been working in the tunnels south of a prominent junction. She provides the characters general directions to reach the section of the mines worth investigating.

### Arguing Princes

Simbon and Kirina join the characters for their expedition. To highlight the tension between them, describe the princes insulting each other using the following summaries for inspiration:

- **Connections to the Throne.** Simbon mentions how close Kirina once was to Empress Inaya, pondering aloud what the prince might have done to earn the empress's disfavor.  
- **Favored of the People.** Simbon idly speculates that Kirina is interested in the Aurum Guild's support because he's so unpopular in Niba and needs to seek out the best friends money can buy.  
- **Strength of Arms.** Kirina reminisces about his past adventuring missions, downplaying Simbon's own combat experience.  

#### Kirina's Secret

During the expedition, [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) seeks opportunities to look heroic and undermine his rival, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md). There's currently little evidence of Kirina and Kedjou's involvement in the Goldwarren's collapse, but Kirina carries with him a copy of the runes the high priest uses in experimental summoning rituals. Prior to the scorpion attack in Anisa, Kirina painted the runes from this paper in a nearby alley, preparing it for the priest's magic. In the course of the expedition into the Goldwarren, if Kirina falls [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone), is rendered [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), or at another opportune time, this paper slips from his clothes. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the dropped paper before Kirina does. Alternatively, a character who sees Kirina drop the paper and recover it can steal the page from Kirina with a successful DC 14 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

If asked about the paper, Kirina is dismissive, claiming to have found it on the street. This copy of the runes might become useful evidence of Kirina's wrongdoing during the adventure's conclusion.

### Goldwarren Features

The stone tunnels and caverns of the Goldwarren have the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings of the mine are 15 feet high.  
- **Floors and Walls.** The once-smooth walls have buckled after the recent tremors; the patches of rubble shown on the map are "difficult terrain".  
- **Gleaming Gold.** Faint veins of gold lace the mine's walls. Mining or collecting ore worth 1 gp takes over an hour of effort.  
- **Light.** Metal torches set into wall brackets line the main junctions and turning points of the mine tunnels. However, their oil hasn't been replenished since the collapse, leaving the mine's tunnels and caverns in darkness.  
- **Statues.** The Goldwarren is a working mine but also a cultural site for Anisa's people. Immovable golden statues of Anisan royals (marked as stars on the map) smile from pedestals along the walls.  

### Goldwarren Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 7.1.

#### G1: Junction Tunnel

After a short, cautious march from the mine entrance, the party reaches a large junction with a turntable where mine cart tracks lead into side tunnels: two leading north, two leading east, and two leading south. Rockfalls have sealed off both tunnels leading east and one of those leading north. One tunnel leading north and both tunnels stretching south—one of which [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) escaped from—are still open. Read the following text as the characters approach:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Just in front of a massive mine track turntable that fills the junction, a body lies splayed on the rocky ground. Even at a distance, it's clear this miner died not from falling rubble, but from terrible slashing wounds.
^221

As the party approaches the turntable, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher hear skittering emanating from a nearby tunnel. Characters who have lower scores are [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised) when several many-legged creatures hurtle out of the northwest passage. These five [aurumvoraxes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md) (detailed in the "Aurumvoraxes" section at the end of this adventure) are hostile and rush to attack.

##### Track Turntable

The mine track turntable can be controlled from a panel at its center, but it was damaged during the cave-in. A character who uses an action to operate the simple controls causes mechanisms below to screech as the entire turntable shakes—trying to rotate, failing, then halting. Every creature on the turntable except the operator must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). Creatures with more than two legs have advantage on this saving throw.

##### Summoned Fury

When an [aurumvorax](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md) is reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes. If they did not already deduce this during the scorpions' attack, characters who succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check know that this is the mark of a magically summoned creature, but also know of no spell that summons such creatures.

##### Miner Body

The body on the ground is that of a missing miner named Enwa, who was killed by an aurumvorax attack. If a character casts the [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) spell on the corpse, all its answers support [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md)'s story from the "Death in the Mines" section.

##### Multiple Paths

[Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md) wasn't sure which of the southern tunnels he fled through. Characters who search the area and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check see that numerous aurumvorax claw marks lead from the southwest tunnel. If the characters head down that tunnel, they reach area G2 after 5 minutes of walking. If they follow any other tunnel, they reach a dead end after 10 minutes and have a 50 percent chance of encountering two [aurumvoraxes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md) gnawing on a seam of gold ore. These aurumvoraxes fight to the death and vanish when reduced to 0 hit points.

#### G2: Southwest Tunnel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Warped cart tracks run down the center of this worked stone tunnel. Here and there, rockslides cover the floor where segments of wall have given way. Openings into rough-hewn caves line the northern wall.
^227

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher notice signs of combat and bloodstains along the tunnel. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait can confirm that the tunnel is not in danger of collapsing, despite the crumbled walls.

The tunnel ends in a rockfall that would take days to clear. The entrance to area G4 is partially obscured by these rocks. Only a character who investigates this rockfall or succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the opening.

#### G3: Newly Dug Caverns

These three caverns are recent excavations seeking new profitable veins of gold. Use some or all of the following encounters in these caverns, depending on how quickly you want to reach the final showdown with the aurumvoraxes.

- **Danger Signs.** A large red X is painted next to one cave entrance, a warning from the mining crew formerly working here. Inside the cavern, three patches of green slime cling to the ceiling (see the "[Dungeon Hazards](Mechanics/traps-hazards/green-slime.md)" section of the "Dungeon Master's Guide") and drop on characters who wander in.  
- **Dangerous Joke.** The back wall of one cavern has collapsed—seemingly on top of a miner, though their boots are the only part of their body still visible. In truth, this rockfall happened months ago, and the boots were carefully stuck into the rubble as a joke by the crew working the wall. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discovers the nature of the prank; a character who have a background in mining or with the Stonecunning trait has advantage on the check. Anyone attempting to free the "body" must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage from falling rubble.  

##### Lounging Lizard

A friendly [giant lizard](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md) lairs in one cavern. It was partly tamed by the miners and allowed to hunt rats and other vermin. The lizard charges the characters as soon as it spots them but doesn't attack immediately. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realize the creature is tame and hungry. The lizard attacks the characters only if they injure it, or if it's not placated with offerings of food.

#### G4: Abandoned Excavation

This small area shows signs that excavations were started here before being abandoned. At the far end of the chamber, a glowing gray stone protrudes from the rough ground. This [stone of controlling earth elementals](Mechanics/items/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.md) formed naturally via elemental magic, and the miners left it untouched until its power could be assessed. It can be removed from the rock surrounding it with a successful DC 16 Strength check, made with advantage by a character using a miner's pick or similar tool.

#### G5: Aurumvorax Nest

A tunnel dug by claws, not pick and shovel, extends from the easternmost of the newly dug caverns. As the characters approach, they hear sounds of movement from the large cavern beyond. This is the nest of the aurumvorax pack, including five [aurumvoraxes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md) and an [aurumvorax den leader](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-den-leader-jttrc.md) (detailed in the "Aurumvorax" section at the end of this adventure). Characters who want to sneak up on the aurumvoraxes can attempt a group DC 13 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check. (Assume one prince succeeds at the check and the other fails, canceling each other out.) With a successful group check, the aurumvoraxes are [surprised](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Surprised).

When the characters enter the chamber, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this chamber are crudely dug and covered with scratches—particularly around seams of glistening ore. A half dozen deep alcoves circle a broad, open space. Two bodies lie in the center of the chamber.
^22c

As in earlier encounters, the conjured aurumvoraxes fight to the death and vanish when reduced to 0 hit points.

The bodies here are those of two of the missing miners. They both bear many claw and bite marks.

##### The Price of Power

During the fight, [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) tries to eliminate [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) as a rival. Kirina antagonizes one or more aurumvoraxes, then slips behind the other prince, leaving the monsters to attack Simbon. The character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score sees Kirina intentionally endanger Simbon.

##### Survivors

Three survivors—including [Awa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/awa-jttrc.md)'s mother, Zihaya—are holed up in an alcove to the west. They have blocked the alcove entrance with crates and mining gear. The aurumvoraxes ignore them while they remain out of sight. Each survivor uses the [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block.

##### Suspicious Runes

Characters who investigate the area where the survivors were hiding can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If they succeed, they find a series of runes drawn on the cave wall with chalk. If the characters found the runes in the alley after the scorpion attack, they recognize these being nearly identical. If they didn't, a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows that the runes are related to conjuration magic but can tell nothing more.

![Awa is ambushed by an auru...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/064-07-004.ambushed-aurumvorax.webp#center "Awa is ambushed by an aurumvorax in the depths of the Goldwarren")

## Beyond the Goldwarren

Once the characters have found them, any survivors are eager to leave the mine. Before they do, Zihaya or another survivor whispers that they saw a stranger with long braided hair and colorful robes in the mines before the collapse. The stranger was drawing the runes in the cavern where the survivors were hiding—the survivor points them out if the characters haven't already noticed. If the characters describe Kedjou to the survivor, the miner supposes the high priest could be the person they saw.

### Confronting the Prince

The characters might confront [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) over his attempt to harm [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) or any other evidence they've discovered. He answers questions confidently, deflecting accusations while smugly claiming no responsibility. Characters can press Kirina on these details by making a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If the characters encouraged [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) to take his role more seriously in the "Support for Prince Simbon" section, Simbon vows to use his influence to reveal Kirina's goals—this gives characters advantage on this check. If one or more checks succeed, the characters coax the following information out of Kirina:

- Both the giant scorpions and aurumvoraxes were conjured by Kedjou to let Kirina play the part of the hero and increase his chances of becoming the empress's next heir.  
- At Kirina's behest, Kedjou crafted the ritual that brought the aurumvoraxes to the Goldwarren.  
- In exchange for positioning Kirina to become Inaya's heir, Kedjou expects to influence Kirina's policy decisions once Kirina becomes emperor.  

If confronted with his responsibility for the miners who died for his charade, the prince merely shrugs. He blames the Aurum Guild for the shoddy conditions that caused the collapses, conveniently ignoring anyone who points out that the burrowing aurumvoraxes clearly contributed to them.

### The Expedition's End

When the characters emerge from the Goldwarren, Uzoma and a crowd of miners flock around the group and hustle off any survivors to have their wounds tended to. Uzoma is quick to thank the characters and pay them. If either of the princes or all the survivors were killed, a second expedition is sent into the mines to recover the bodies.

#### Exposing the Enemy

If the characters mention [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) endangering [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) to Uzoma, she's surprised and listens to their story. Kirina denies the allegation, claiming the characters are in league with Simbon. With little patience for bickering amid her other duties, Uzoma quickly dismisses the distraction.

However, if the characters reveal that [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md) and High Priest Kedjou were responsible for the aurumvoraxes' appearance and back up their claims with evidence, such as the matching symbols from the cave and [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md)'s or Kedjou's notes, Uzoma believes them and is outraged. [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md)'s confidence rapidly flags, and he makes a weak attempt at excuses, claiming the characters are lying on [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md)'s behalf.

If the characters encouraged [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) to take his role more seriously in the "Support for Prince Simbon" section, Simbon speaks out against Kirina, cutting through his excuses. If they didn't, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to undermine Kirina's defense.

If Kirina's excuses are believed, he swiftly leaves the area and, soon after, returns to his home city of Niba. Otherwise, with [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md)'s support, Uzoma throws status to the wind and orders her miners to lock Kirina in a nearby office while she summons the guards.

## Conclusion

After Kirina's formal arrest, Uzoma demands an immediate investigation of High Priest Kedjou's lodgings to confirm the characters' claims. Bolstered by [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md)'s influence, she drives immediate action. The characters might join her, Simbon, and a group of guards in a surprise visit to Kedjou's chambers, where the high priest is caught off guard. His research notes—matching the runes in the Goldwarren—are discovered. The high priest is quickly taken into custody.

In the aftermath of Kirina's and Kedjou's arrests, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) thanks the characters for supporting him and revealing [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md)'s plot. He rewards them with two of his family's treasures, an [adamantine chain shirt](Mechanics/items/adamantine-armor.md) and a [ring of warmth](Mechanics/items/ring-of-warmth.md) emblazoned with the sunburst symbol of Anisa—Simbon says the ring carries with it the warmth of his homeland's sun and his family's friendship. It's also clear that Simbon is impressed with Uzoma. Together the pair might become a force to be reckoned with in Anisa and beyond.

If Kirina and Kedjou's plot isn't revealed, Kirina's rise in influence continues. Knowing the depths of his rival's treachery, [Prince Simbon](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-simbon-jttrc.md) might request the characters' aid in exposing the rival prince's future plots.

## Sensa Empire Gazetteer

The Sensa Empire runs on gold. Its three principal city-states—Anisa, Niba, and Tarikh—were each built around gold mines, and as their wealth has grown, so has their population, influence, and foreign trade. Most of the empire is arid and difficult to cultivate, so the regions between the city-states are sparsely inhabited and often lack the resources available in cosmopolitan areas. Still, the city-states and the outlands are tied together by Empress Inaya's rule, with each city governed autonomously by a hereditary monarch subject to the empress's ultimate authority.

Though the Sensa Empire is known as a peaceful realm, it faces a rocky transition of power. The next ruler is traditionally chosen from among the three city-states' royal families, excluding the direct descendants of the current ruler. But for years, Empress Inaya quietly made it known that she planned to appoint her own son to follow her—and in so doing, seemingly brought down a legendary curse that claimed the lives of her husband and eldest son. When the grieving empress announced she would appoint her successor from among the royal families of Anisa, Niba, or Tarikh as tradition dictated, the rulers of the city-states began to fight for favor—and competition for that favor is brutal.

### Features

Those familiar with the Sensa Empire know the following facts:

- **Hallmarks.** The empire is a collection of cosmopolitan city-states known for its expert goldsmiths and fabulous wealth.  
- **People.** Most residents of the region are dark-skinned humans with brown eyes and tightly coiled dark hair. These features are shared by dwarves and elves in the region.  
- **Languages.** Sensan is the native language of the region, and most imperial citizens also speak Common.  

### Noteworthy Sites

The Sensa Empire is structured around the three city-states of Anisa, Niba, and Tarikh, each a wealthy oasis in an arid and unforgiving landscape.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/066-map-7.2-sensa-empire-player.webp#gallery)

#### Anisa

The city-state of Anisa, in the east of Sensa, is ruled by the aging King Diara. Thanks to the wealth of the Goldwarren mine, the city's gold production far outpaces that of its neighbors. The people value education highly, and the city is home to Anisa Academy, the only university in the empire. Politically, the city has enjoyed years of peace under King Diara's rule, but many dread his inevitable retirement. While the king's heir—his oldest child, Simbon—waffles on how seriously he takes his responsibilities, Diara's daughter, Zahra, seeks to replace her brother as heir to the throne.

#### Niba

The city-state of Niba lies along Sensa's southeastern coast. Ruled by Queen Sainesha, the city is known for its grand bazaars and for being home to some of the most talented goldsmiths in the region. Entertainment in the form of cafes, theaters, and raceways is also central to life in the city. Among Niba's many celebrities is the queen's firstborn and heir, the ambitious and charismatic [Prince Kirina](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/prince-kirina-jttrc.md).

#### Tarikh

The city-state of Tarikh lies in Sensa's northwestern reaches, nestled against jagged peaks. Its young ruler, King Sundasha, balances commercial needs and the local environment, as the city's scattered oases provide it with some of the only arable land in the region. While much of this land provides for the empire's people, a significant fraction is used to grow feed for the city's prized herds of camels. Tarikh also hosts the Seven Stairs, the headquarters of the Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet.

#### The Azure Dome

The deep-blue dome of Empress Inaya's coastal palace holds the seat of the Sensa Empire's power. Within the Azure Dome, the empress meets with her councilors and entertains the rulers of her three city-states. Merely entering the Azure Dome is considered a high honor for citizens of the empire.

![Prince Simbon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/067-07-005.prince-simon.webp#center)

The Azure Dome's legendary security couldn't protect Empress Inaya's husband and eldest son, Salaba and Shayan, from dying under unusual circumstances. Both passed away in their sleep after a state dinner—as they were in perfect health, it's believed they were poisoned by an unknown hand.

#### Tomb of the Faceless

Half a day's ride north from Tarikh, the Tomb of the Faceless stands alone in the desert. A site of ritual pilgrimage and worship, the tomb is a large golden dome without an entrance that holds the Prophet's bones. The Prophet was a respected scholar and reformer adamant that her persona not eclipse her teachings. She insisted that after her death her followers not repeat her name or depict her face in art. Today, the faithful leave offerings of gold and salt at the site, which are collected at dusk by the clergy known as the Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet.

According to the acolytes who tend the tomb, learning the Prophet's name grants forbidden and dangerous power. Every so often, someone attempts to break into the tomb in search of clues to the Prophet's identity—a crime punished by permanent exile from the empire.

### Life in the Sensa Empire

Those who live in the Sensa Empire or who travel through the land experience its wealth, both in riches and deep traditions.

#### Aurum Guild

Gold mining is a respected career, crucial to the empire's prosperity. Those who work with the riches of the earth number among the land's most respect artisans and have few peers. To support its members, the Aurum Guild allows miners and craftspeople to build social and professional connections, better their craft, and organize for improved labor conditions. Each city-state has its own chapter of the guild that pushes back when local rulers make unfair demands of miners for personal benefit—often placing the guild in conflict with those rulers.

#### Life and Legends

The empire is known for its rich tradition of oral storytelling, in which traveling historian-storytellers known as griots pass down tales from generation to generation. The most common tales are of Emperor Kassa, who founded the Sensa Empire after defeating the now-extinct aurumvoraxes—gold-eating predators—that once plagued the region.

The arid land of the Sensan Empire has inspired simple fashions, and Sensans of all genders wear loose cotton tunics, trousers, dresses, or caftans to stay cool. The region's deserts provide limited opportunities for agriculture. While spices and preserved foods are frequently imported, ocean-caught whitefish and locally grown plantains, cassava, and yams serve as staples of the Sensan diet.

#### Split Rule

The Sensa Empire's three city-states are hereditary monarchies united into a coalition under the empress's control. Historically, rather than a single imperial line controlling the throne, each empress or emperor selects an heir from among the eldest children of each city-state's monarch. While no law prevents rulers from selecting their own children as heirs, few do so, fearing they'll fall victim to a terrible curse. Heirs are usually chosen based on merit.

#### Wealth of the Empire

With gold abundant in the Sensa Empire, there's no lack of lucrative, respected jobs in the mines, though the work comes with occupational hazards. But the wealth of the empire often draws threats. Banditry is an ongoing problem, and sometimes diplomacy is all that prevents raids from neighboring territories.

#### Names

Sensan names are typically drawn from significant locations connected to the parents' relationship, the pregnancy, or the child's birth:

- **Feminine.** Aisha, Ayaan, Daniya, Fiza, Imani, Kinza, Laila, Sabah, Tania, Zakia  
- **Masculine.** Abdu, Dakhil, Ehan, Fahim, Haji, Jamal, Kasim, Mahdi, Omar, Zaid  
- **Gender-Neutral.** Akua, Azmi, Ijal, Jami, Maheen, Neeya, Rafi, Razan, Ula, Zuha  
- **Surname.** Abiodun, Buhle, Chike, Emem, Nnadi, Okiro, Zivai

### Characters from Sensa

If players want to create a character from the Sensa Empire, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**What city-state do you originate from?** Are you staunchly loyal to your home city? If you grew up in the hostile outlands, how did your family survive?

**Have you worked with the earth or its riches?** Mining and goldsmithing are respected work in the Sensa Empire—are you experienced with such work? Do you bear scars from such labor? If you avoided it, why?

**How does gold impact your life?** The Sensa Empire's prosperity comes at a price—have you experienced these costs personally? Have you ever been targeted by bandits? Are there any resources you want or need that can't be bought?

## Aurumvoraxes

An aurumvorax is an eight-legged, badger-like hunter. These aggressive omnivores attack any prey they think they can best, ambushing even creatures double their size. They supplement their diets with metal, whether it's worked or ore, and they have a particular taste for gold. This diet lends aurumvorax fur its golden sheen.

Alone or in small groups, aurumvoraxes dig deep in search of precious metals. Such exploration often leads them into conflict with subterranean settlements. As defenders of such communities often wear metal armor, aurumvoraxes prioritize attacking armored foes—whether that armor is metal or not.

### Aurumvorax

Early in life, [aurumvoraxes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/aurumvorax-jttrc.md) cooperate with siblings and their den leader parents, digging tunnels in search of metal and other burrowing prey. As they grow to adulthood, aurumvoraxes hunt on their own, carving out territories they viciously defend.

### Aurumvorax Den Leader

Aurumvoraxes that feed on a steady supply of precious metals gradually grow in size. These aurumvoraxes are faster and deadlier than others of their kind.

![Aurumvorax Den Leader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/068-637937472194816849.webp#center)
