# Orchids of the Invisible Mountain
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 202* 

*An Adventure for 14th-Level Characters*

The land of Atagua exists at a weak point between several planes of existence. Feywild influences work upon the land, but in recent years, corruption from the Far Realm has begun leaking into the savanna. The characters must journey to the Feywild and beyond to quell the alien forces spreading across the increasingly surreal plains.

## Background

The land of Atagua shares a connection to the Ghost Orchid Tepui, a mysterious region of the Feywild. That realm's serpentine protector, the spirit Chimagua, was fond of mortals and would bestow visions upon the folk of Atagua. However, when Atagua fell to invaders from a distant land, visions from Chimagua ended. The sages known as the Green Doctors sought to reconnect the land to the Feywild, but their attempts failed and weakened the planar fabric around Atagua. Soon, the region's people began experiencing terrible nightmares that gradually began manifesting in the form of terrifying creatures connected to an inscrutable Far Realm entity known as the Drought Elder. Horrified by their mistake, the Green Doctors scrambled to push back the eldritch creatures with a hastily woven magical ward.

Today, though Atagua is independent again, its magical ward has finally collapsed. The influence of the Drought Elder seeps in to Atagua once more. For years, this corruption has manifested only as dreams or the rare otherworldly predator, but recently more beings from the Far Realm have begun to slip into Atagua. Only the return of the spirit Chimagua might save the land, but all is not as it should be at the Ghost Orchid Tepui. Unless Atagua's ancient connection to the Feywild is restored, creatures from the Far Realm will overrun the land.

### Setting the Adventure

When preparing to run this adventure, use the following suggestions to help contextualize Atagua in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters who visit Atagua from the Radiant Citadel arrive not far from the Sarire sugar mill.  
- **Forgotten Realms.** The Plains of Purple Dust in Mulhorand or the Shining Plains along the Vilhon Reach could host the grasslands of Atagua.  
- **Greyhawk.** Atagua could occupy a region of the Plains of the Paynims east of Ket and the Barrier Peaks. Alternatively, the plains of the Great Kingdom might include or border Atagua, with the land's culture holding connections to the sky-worshiping Aerdi people.  

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Dream Message.** A character suffers nightmares of a radiant snake fighting a massive, crumbling centipede. They awake with one word in their mind: "Sarire." If they investigate, they learn the word is a location in the land of Atagua, where a spirit called Chimagua speaks through dreams.  
- **Planar Instability.** According to a sage, a planar conjunction is affecting Atagua. She hires the characters to travel there, visit a site near the Sarire Sugar Mill, and record any planar anomalies.  
- **Sugar Man's Summons.** Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi, a powerful landowner, has agents reach out to the characters with an offer of employment, but he requests they discuss it at his place of business, the Sarire sugar mill in Atagua.  

### Dreams and Portents

Strange dreams are common in Atagua, the result of psychic energies from the Feywild and Far Realm. Whenever a character sleeps or meditates while in Atagua, roll on the Dreams in Atagua table to determine if they have a strange vision.

### Unreality

Atagua is influenced by dreams from the Feywild and nightmares from the Far Realm. Throughout the adventure, highlight how the Feywild has influenced the land, with vegetation and animals demonstrating friendly or capricious behavior, the sun rising amid a psychedelic dawn, or characters experiencing random instances of good luck. Meanwhile, Far Realm energies manifest as eyes staring from the dark, insidious insects, or misshapen silhouettes looming in the distance. The land's fraying planar boundaries might also allow glimpses into other planes or ghostly appearances of strange figures. Let Atagua's place between the real and surreal inspire your descriptions.

## Starting the Adventure

As the adventure begins, the characters are traveling to the Sarire sugar mill, most likely coming from Port Panela. If the characters seek to learn more about the region there, consult the "Atagua Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure. From the port, the route called the Camino Rojo stretches between flamingo-filled wetlands and grassy plains covered with sugarcane fields. The surrounding flatland is hot, and few clouds provide respite from the relentless sun. The road is safe, and traders frequently pass by.

### Burning Sugar

As the Sarire sugar mill comes into view, the smell of cooking sugarcane rises on the breeze. Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters are about a quarter mile from the mill:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead stands a sugar mill, a massive wooden shed with a pointed thatched roof. Smoke rises from its many chimneys, and the area is busy with workers sorting through piles of sugarcane.
> 
> An otherworldly shimmer warps the air around the mill, like a haze of silver rain that vanishes as quickly as it appears. A moment later, a scream rings out, followed by a crash. A column of smoke rises through the structure's roof.
^4a7

Workers race toward the building as smoke billows through the roof and doors. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check suspects that the shimmer in the air could have been some manner of planar disturbance.

#### Fire at the Mill

When the characters reach the mill, they see the full scope of the disturbance:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Through the broad, open doors of the mill, you see that the interior has collapsed into a great sinkhole. Large, overturned kettles spill boiling sugarcane juice across the broken floor, and the fires that once heated those kettles leap up nearby columns and race along the thatched reed roof. A half dozen workers have fallen into the sinkhole and struggle to clamber out.
^4a9

The mill is in chaos as a dozen workers make disorganized attempts to douse the fires. Over the noise, a character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 18 or higher notices an eerie, whistling emanating from no place in particular.

##### Sinkhole

The opening of the sinkhole is 20 feet wide and descends into a 20-foot-deep pit. Six workers (neutral, human [commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) are at the bottom of the pit, frantically trying to climb out. Climbing the sinkhole's crumbling walls requires a successful DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, but the panicked workers repeatedly fail to escape. A character who investigates the sinkhole and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check sees that the earth of its walls is dry and dead, like it's from somewhere else entirely.

##### Whistlers

A moment after a character looks in the hole, two large, gaunt, bipedal figures appear within. These are creatures from the Far Realm called [whistlers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure). They've teleported into the sinkhole and seek to feed on the trapped workers. If unimpeded, the hostile whistlers slay one worker per round, taking their time to savor the confused mortals' fear. If attacked, they teleport near their attacker and ignore the workers. The alien beings fight to the death.

### Mysterious Manifestations

Once the whistlers are defeated, the threat isn't past. The mill's burning roof threatens to collapse. The characters have time to escape with the workers, but the structure gives way moments after they leave. The mill's workers can only watch as the building is consumed by flames.

After the characters escape, another strange event occurs. Read the following description once all the characters are out of danger:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A tearing sound precedes the appearance of a silvery ripple hovering in the air nearby. From the anomaly, a frantic-looking scarlet macaw shoots forth, trailing silvery motes. A figure appears behind the bird, pushing as though trying to pass through, but held fast by the portal's flickering magic.
> 
> "Is anyone there?" a woman in a beaded vest shouts. "I can see you, but I can't get through!"
^4ad

The figure is [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md), an Ataguan warrior lost to time. She stands on the far side of an unstable planar rift between the Material Plane and the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the planar rift, a temporary and potentially dangerous portal created by multiplanar energies, not deliberate magic. While [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md)'s macaw was able to slip through, the rift is fading, preventing further passage in either direction.

After a moment, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) continues:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Listen, please!" the woman calls. "I'm [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md). The Ghost Orchid Tepui is under siege by alien creatures. Chimagua, our guardian, has fallen into a deathly slumber. If the great spirit dies, all is lost. If you are brave souls, seek the tepui. Find the portal in the Llanos. [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) knows the way. But be—"
> 
> With a sound like breaking glass, the rift collapses and is gone.
^4ae

Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recognize references to the Ghost Orchid Tepui, along with any of the stories from the "Legends of Atagua" section at the end of this adventure.

The macaw that passed through the rift squawks as he circles frantically. This is [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md)'s companion, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md). He lands on the shoulder of any character who beckons to him.

#### Nene

[Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) is a macaw from the Feywild. He uses the [hawk](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/hawk.md) stat block but has the Fey type, has Intelligence 7, and can speak and understand simple phrases and concepts in Common. [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) has a boisterous personality but is easily distracted. He can mime straightforward responses to questions, tap objects to get his point across, scratch simple images in the dirt, and so forth. The macaw is confused by the process of passing through the rift but is eager to get back to the Feywild and can lead the characters to a portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui (see the "Across the Llanos" section).

![Yarana and Nene](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/135-14-002.yarana-and-nene.webp#center)

### The Sugar Man

Though the mill can't be saved, the workers prevent the fire from spreading, and they are happy to accept the aid of any characters who want to help. As they work, several laborers whisper fearfully, claiming they saw whistlers. If asked, a worker tells the characters that whistlers are beings that emerge from the shadows, whistling a creepy tune as they steal away the unwary. They're a well-known local legend, but few have ever seen one—until now.

Soon after the mill collapses, its owner, Alfonz "Sugar Man" Rubinaz-Zumdi, arrives on the scene, escorted by several bodyguards.

#### Alfonz "Sugar Man" Rubinaz-Zumdi

The venerable Alfonz (neutral, human [noble](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) reminds everyone he meets that he is the patriarch of a great estate and the landlord of every sugarcane field surrounding the city of El Caparazón. In just three generations, the razor-tongued Sugar Man has transformed his clan, the Zumdi, from farm laborers into the closest thing to nobility that Ataguan society has yet seen. From the stately old hacienda he calls the Sugar Alcázar, the Sugar Man hosts dazzling galas and subtly manipulates local farm owners and bosses from across Atagua to his service.

#### Assessing the Situation

Workers quickly describe to Alfonz what happened. The Sugar Man asks the characters to join in the conversation, forgoing introductions to get to the heart of the situation. Use the following to guide the discussion:

- The Sugar Man is astonished to hear of the sinkhole. He's thoughtful if the characters suggest a planar disturbance was responsible for it.  
- He pays particular attention to any report of [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md)'s words. A worker mentions this to the Sugar Man if the characters don't.  
- In response to any description of the whistlers, the Sugar Man scoffs openly. He is taken aback if a character shows him evidence of a whistler.  

Once he has a grasp of the situation, the Sugar Man orders his bodyguards to help the survivors, assess the damage to the mill, and leave him to speak with the characters alone.

#### The Sugar Man's Offer

Alfonz leads the characters into the privacy of a storehouse and thanks them for their aid. He focuses in on what [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) told them and asks what they know about the Ghost Orchid Tepui. He can reveal any information from the "Legends of Atagua" section, but he insists that whistlers are folk tales to frighten children.

He shares the following as he sets out an offer for the characters:

- This [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) person seems to think the macaw can lead the characters to the legendary Ghost Orchid Tepui. The Sugar Man wants the characters to undertake a mission for him if they find a way to that mysterious mountain.  
- Legends say that mythical plants called ghost orchids grow on the tepui. The [white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod of a ghost orchid is said to have the power to bring the dead back to life. The Sugar Man wants the characters to bring him one of these white seed pods.  

The Sugar Man's excitement is obvious. If pressed as to why he wants the seed pod, he says only that someone dear to him was once lost, and he wishes to see that person live again. He doesn't share the details, but the Sugar Man plans to use the power of the seed pod to resurrect his son, Endis, who died a year ago. In exchange for procuring a white seed pod for him, the Sugar Man promises to pay the characters 1,250 gp each. Whether or not the characters take the Sugar Man up on his offer, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) the macaw is anxious to return to [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md). He begins repeating what the characters and the Sugar Man say in mocking tones until they move on.

## Across the Llanos

Long ago, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) traveled across the grasslands of Atagua, known as the Llanos, with [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md). He knows the location of the secret gateway that leads from Atagua to the Ghost Orchid Tepui, but much has changed in the years since the fey-touched bird explored the region. His directions are general and often as simple as "this way" or "that way." Regardless, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md)'s directions are accurate and eventually lead to the Feywild portal.

Provided the characters follow [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md)'s directions, the journey from the sugar mill to the Ghost Orchid Tepui portal passes through El Caparazón, over the Grassroads, and along Zula's Trail before venturing into the grasslands. The entire trek is about 48 miles long and takes 2 days to complete at a normal pace.

Alternatively, characters who have access to the [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) spell can forgo the journey and travel directly to the Ghost Orchid Tepui. If they use this spell to do so, proceed with the "Ghost Orchid Tepui" section.

### Visiting El Caparazón

The largest settlement in the region, El Caparazón is partially shaded by a gigantic, half-dome lattice structure created in the distant past. This shelter cools the city's homes and its vast markets, which are largely peopled by Humanoids and visiting thri-kreen traders. The characters can find ample places to rest and resupply here. They can also purchase a map of the region, similar to the one that appears as map 14.4 at the end of this adventure, for 1 gp. El Caparazón is further detailed in the "Atagua Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure.

### The Grassroads

The Grassroads is a network of cleverly constructed wood-and-reed bridges standing 15 to 40 feet above the ground. Approximately every 5 miles along the walkways, collections of 10-foot-wide lean-tos offer travelers protection from the unrelenting sun and a comfortable spot to hitch hammocks. Charitable travelers leave items they can afford to share in the lean-tos. Each time the characters stop at such a lean-to waypoint, roll on or choose from the Lean-To Items table to see what they find.

**Lean-To Items**

`dice: [](15-orchids-of-the-invisible-mountain.md#^lean-to-items)`

| dice: d10 | Item |
|-----------|------|
| 1–4 | Nothing |
| 5 | `1d4` cones of panela |
| 6 | A guitar with one broken string |
| 7 | A pouch of coffee or cacao beans |
| 8 | A fine straw hat and a lightly used pair of sandals |
| 9 | A thri-kreen weapon called a chatkcha (detailed in the "Thri-kreen" section of the "Monster Manual") |
| 10 | A sleeping [rooster](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rooster-jttrc.md) (use the statistics for a [hawk](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/hawk.md), but with no flying speed) |
^lean-to-items

### Ambushed Thri-Kreen

After the characters have traveled the Grassroads for about a day, the following encounter occurs:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Grassroads appear infinite and disappear into the haze. Ahead, an insectile traveler trudges toward you. Suddenly, there's a shriek overhead, and a vulture-headed griffon dives toward the traveler.
^4b8

The [thri-kreen](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thri-kreen.md) is 100 feet ahead of the characters and has little defense against the [griffon](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md). Roll initiative. The characters can drive off the griffon by dealing damage to it or by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check. If they don't drive it off, the griffon grapples the thri-kreen and carries its panicking prey 20 feet into the air. The griffon tries to fly away, moving at half speed as it carries the thri-kreen back to its lair.

If rescued, the thri-kreen introduces himself as Phik-Pik, a trader headed to El Caparazón with a fine selection of salted meats—likely what attracted the griffon's attention. Aside from offering the characters a great deal on capybara jerky (only 1 gp per pound), he gifts them his gythka (detailed in the "Thri-kreen" section of the "Monster Manual") and a [bag of beans](Mechanics/items/bag-of-beans.md) with three beans remaining.

### Termite Mounds

[Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) guides the characters across the eastern extent of the Llanos, growing more excited as he recognizes familiar terrain. Read the following description when the characters reach the plains near the bend of the Holroro river:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A wide stretch of tombstone-sized termite mounds is dominated by a tall mound with an unusually flat top. Giant anteaters mill around the mounds but pay little attention to anything except their search for a meal.
^4ba

The termite mounds here are natural and aren't dangerous; the giant anteaters (use the [giant badger](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-badger.md) stat block) ignore the characters unless disturbed.

Characters who can communicate with the anteaters find them to be lazy, well-fed beasts. If asked about the tall termite mound, the anteaters explain that they live in that mound but the eating's better among the smaller mounds. The anteaters don't explain further and might doze off if characters persistently ask boring, non-food-related questions.

![The mysterious Ghost Orchi...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/136-14-003.ghost-orchid-tepui.webp#center "The mysterious Ghost Orchid Tepui is a familiar sight in the dreams of Atagua's people")

#### The Giant Mound

[Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md)'s excited squawking confirms that the giant mound is where the portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui stands, and the macaw flies straight for it. Characters who investigate the 18-foot-tall mound find it crawling with termites but also discover a sizable crack in one side. This supernaturally dark gap is wide enough for a Large creature to squeeze into. A character who casts [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) finds the gap radiates an aura of conjuration magic. A creature who passes through the gap enters a planar portal that transports them to the Ghost Orchid Tepui.

## Ghost Orchid Tepui

When a character enters the giant termite mound in the Llanos, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Llanos vanishes, replaced by the earthy scent of jungle. As you emerge through a hollow in a large tree, thick rain forest vegetation surrounds you. Heavy mist hangs in the air, obscuring the top of a spire rising hundreds of feet into the sky, no more than a hundred feet away. A roaring waterfall cascades down the tepui, and a well-trodden path twists toward it through the trees.
^4bd

Upon passing through the portal, the characters arrive at the Ghost Orchid Tepui, a mysterious corner of the Feywild. This tiny realm stretches about a mile in all directions around the tepui—a steep, pale, flat-topped mountain. Around and atop the mountain is a lush rain forest full of mist, colorful flora, and curious insects. Creatures that wander into the rain forest find it increasingly dense and difficult to traverse. After an hour of travel, creatures emerge near the Ghost Orchid Tepui no matter which direction they were headed.

With a shriek, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) encourages the characters to proceed down the path toward the tepui. He then flies up the side of the tepui and over the top.

### Tepui Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 14.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 14.1: Ghost Orchid Tepui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/137-map-14.1-ghost-orchid-tepui.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/138-map-14.1-ghost-orchid-tepui-player.webp#gallery)

#### A1: Waterfall Pool

As the characters approach the base of the tepui, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The path ends at a clearing before an immense waterfall. It cascades down the tepui's cliffs into a pool coated with oily, gray slime. Dense mist hangs above the pool.
^4c0

The water of the pool, the waterfall, and the stream that feeds them in area A4 has been magically tainted, causing creatures that touch it to rapidly decay. Any creature that enters the water for the first time on a turn or that starts its turn in the water takes 44 (`8d10`) necrotic damage. A character who investigates the water and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check, or who tests the water by submerging any sort of organic material, recognizes the water's magical corruption. The [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the water has an aura of necromantic magic.

#### A2: Ancient Statue

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A small stone platform rises from the edge of the pool, supporting a larger-than-life quartz statue of an elf priest with outstretched arms.
^4c2

The ruins here belong to an elven tribe that once dwelled in this region. They moved on long ago but left behind a statue of a forgotten healer.

##### Cloaker

Two pale [cloakers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/cloaker.md) that can speak Common and Elvish cling to the statue's back, disguising themselves as leathery wings. When a creature nears the statue, the cloakers take turns posing as the spirit of the statue. They offer to bless any character who shows their purity by bathing in the pool. A character who succeeds on a Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check contested by the cloakers' Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check recognizes that the "spirit" is a little too eager with its request. Additionally, a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes the voices are coming from behind the statue. The cloakers attack when a creature comes within 5 feet of the statue or it's clear no one's buying their lies.

##### Statue

A spirit actually does linger in the statue. Once the cloakers are defeated, the statue glows faintly. The first injured creature to touch the statue regains 45 (`10d8`) hit points. Once the statue heals a creature, its glow fades and the spirit departs.

#### A3: Waterfall Ascent

The walls of the tepui rise 1,000 feet but boast plentiful handholds, making the tepui easy to climb without an ability check. The waterfall's water is deadly, as described in area A1.

##### Tainted Mist

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notes that the mist surrounding the tepui grows thicker 100 feet up and has a faint green tinge. This mist is 50 feet thick and extends 100 feet from the cliff wall. Creatures that enter the mist must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with sight rot (detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Strong wind disperses the mist for 1 minute, while removing its source in the Crystal Caves causes the mist to vanish.

##### Through the Falls

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 20 or higher, or who pass through the waterfall to see what's behind it, find a ledge about 100 feet from the ground. Upon the ledge rests an elf skeleton. In the skeleton's moldy backpack is a shard of white crystal (worth 300 gp), a [dagger of venom](Mechanics/items/dagger-of-venom.md), and a [potion of invulnerability](Mechanics/items/potion-of-invulnerability.md).

#### A4: Tepui Plateau

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The top of the mountain is covered by brilliant green rain forest vegetation. A deep stream cuts through the foliage, running alongside a ridge before cascading off the tepui's edge. A trail vanishes through a cleft in the ridge, with low, green vapor billowing along the path. Above, a shattered ship teeters atop a higher ledge.
^4c9

The stream's waters are deadly, as detailed in area A1.

The cleft in the ridge is the opening to a short, narrow canyon. Within lies a cave with green-tinged vapor flowing from it. This passage leads to area C1 of the Crystal Caves (see below) and the source of the gas. A creature that enters this trail of gas or the cave into the Crystal Caves suffers the effects of the mist, as detailed in area A3.

As soon as the characters arrive, [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) flutters excitedly toward the cleft in the ridge, leading them toward the entrance to the Crystal Caves while avoiding the toxic vapor.

#### A5: Crashed Airship

A crashed airship rests precariously atop the tepui. Those who ascend an additional 30 feet up the mountainside reach the deck of the shattered vessel.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Vines cover the ship's shattered hull. Little more than a moldy deck and toppled masts remains. Bits of frayed rope and broad scraps of patchwork fabric litter the deck.
^4cb

This airship found its way to the Ghost Orchid Tepui decades ago and became stranded. There is no evidence of its former owner. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check surmises that the scraps of fabric and rope are all that remains of a blimp-like balloon the ship was once suspended from.

##### Below Decks

The ship's lower decks are crushed, creating a narrow, crumbling space between the surviving upper deck and the stone below. A drowsy [displacer beast](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) makes its den in this tight space, accessing it via a gap in the northern part of the hull. The creature is indifferent to the characters and attempts to hide from them if they remain on deck. It tries to flee if cornered within its den.

##### Treasure

Bones and scraps of hide litter the displacer beast's den. Characters who search through the debris find an electrum septum piercing worth 150 gp and a set of [dimensional shackles](Mechanics/items/dimensional-shackles.md).

## Crystal Caves

[Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) leads the characters to the mouth of a cave but refuses to enter the noxious mist that flows from within. This is the entrance to the Crystal Caves, the dwelling place of the spirit Chimagua, whom [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) entreated the characters to save.

### Crystal Caves Features

Locations throughout the Crystal Caves have the following features.

- **Ceilings.** Most cavern ceilings are 20 feet high and are hung with crystalline stalactites.  
- **Lighting.** Crystals embedded in the walls and ceilings radiate dim light for 30 feet. Once a crystal is removed, it stops glowing.  

### Crystal Caves Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 14.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 14.2: Crystal Caves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/139-map-14.2-crystal-caves.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/140-map-14.2-crystal-caves-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1: Pool of Skins

A tunnel filled with noxious gas runs 100 feet from area A4 on the Ghost Orchid Tepui before opening into a larger chamber. Read the following description when the characters enter the cavern:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Glowing crystals speckle this cavern's walls like stars in the night sky. At the chamber's center, a thick, foul-smelling mist billows from a shallow pool of brackish liquid. Something large and scaly lies within. Beyond it stands a sculpted pillar and a broad stone table.
^4d2

The pool in this room once served as a reflecting pool for a pillar sculpted with images of serene, intertwined snakes with glowing crystalline eyes. The waters have since been despoiled by rotting skin shed by the spirit snake Chimagua.

The stone table bears two empty stone candle holders.

##### Tainted Mist

The same tainted mist from area A3 fills this chamber and the tunnel leading back to the Ghost Orchid Tepui.

##### Pool

The pool is the source of the tainted mist. Air from deeper in the cavern blows the mist rising from the pool outside. Any creature that enters the pool must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become infected with sight rot (detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). If the pool is drained (perhaps using spells like [stone shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md)) or the skin within is destroyed or removed, the poison mist ceases rising from the water.

**Snake's Skin**. Partially submerged in the pool is a 100-foot-long, opalescent skin shed by the gigantic anaconda Chimagua. The skin has AC 15, hp 40, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire if it is removed from the water. Creatures that touch the skin without protective gear must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become infected with sight rot (detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). A character who examines the skin and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check can tell it comes from a Feywild creature, not a natural snake, and that the skin has become riddled with disease as it rotted.

#### C2: Meditation Nook

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Several sleeping mats circle an empty firepit in this small side cave. Upon a modest altar sits a stone censer and several sticks of incense.
^4d6

Students and guests of Chimagua once rested and meditated here.

##### Incense

The incense sticks are broken and useless, with the exception of one. If the intact incense stick is burned, the area within 10 feet of the incense fills with acrid smoke for 5 minutes or until the incense is extinguished. A creature that enters the smoke or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. A creature [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by the incense is [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and experiences what feels like years' worth of dreams about infinitely long, psychedelic serpents. When the creature awakes, it gains "inspiration".

##### Secret Path

A character who searches this cavern and succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discovers a segment of the stone wall behind the altar easily shifts aside, revealing a passage leading to area C4. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait have advantage on this check. This door is obvious to any creature in the passage beyond.

#### C3: Whistling Hall

Two [whistlers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) lurk in this hall. If creatures make considerable noise in area C2, the whistlers attempt to teleport behind the intruders, following them into area C4 to ambush them with the other whistler in that area. Otherwise, they attack when the characters enter this passage.

#### C4: Orchid Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ledges within this cavern overlook a pool of black liquid twenty feet below. At the center of the cave, an island supports an ancient, bare tree. Rope bridges connect this island to the ledge at the cavern's entrance and another along the back wall.
^4db

A [whistler](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) lurks at the western edge of the northern platform. It waits to attack until intruders appear vulnerable—such as when they're crossing the rope bridges.

##### Rope Bridge

The rope bridge to area C5 looks ancient and fragile. It has AC 10, hp 14, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

##### Secret Door

A character who searches the southwest ledge and succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discovers a segment of the stone wall moves, revealing a passage leading to area C2. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait have advantage on this check. This door is obvious to any creature in the passage beyond.

#### C5: Ghost Orchid Tree

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The roots of a great, bare-limbed tree wind through the flat-topped rock at the cavern's center. Orchids bearing large white flowers wrap around the tree.
^4df

The ancient tree is a sacred plant that Chimagua cultivated. It rises 20 feet to the cavern ceiling.

##### Night Hags

Three [night hags](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md)—Lola la Lúgubre, Tia Tóxica, and Ofilia la Odiosa—claim this cavern and the ghost orchids that grow here. The crones are [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and lurk at the base of the tree. As soon as a character reaches the island, all three appear, disguised as elf priests in white robes. They claim to be magically bound to the island by the creature that lies on the ledge beyond—pointing to area C6. They try to convince intruders to free them by slaying the monster there. In truth, they want to trick the characters onto the rope bridge so they can destroy it, dropping the characters into the water of area C7 and then disposing of them via magic.

##### Ghost Orchids

The pale flowers growing on the tree are ghost orchids. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check identifies the ghost orchids and their properties (see the "Ghost Orchids" sidebar). Additionally, a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the orchids bear one [black seed](Mechanics/items/black-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod and one [white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod, both of which can be removed.

##### Treasure

The hags have left their treasure in a hollow at the base of the tree. Inside are three black opals (worth 1,000 gp each), a [bag of devouring](Mechanics/items/bag-of-devouring.md), a [potion of flying](Mechanics/items/potion-of-flying.md), and a toucan skull with a wax plug that is a container filled with [sovereign glue](Mechanics/items/sovereign-glue.md).

#### C6: The Sleeping Stone

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ten-foot-tall, chipped gray crystal rises from this ledge, pulsing with pale light. On the rock shelf behind it, a familiar woman stands near an enormous anaconda that's coiled and motionless.
^4e4

Chimagua, the guardian spirit of the Ghost Orchid Tepui, lies here. Tainted by foul Far Realm energies, the coiled, 40-foot-long anaconda is [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher sees that Chimagua is incorporeal, fading in and out of existence with each slow breath.

##### Yarana

Since contacting to the characters, Chimagua's ally [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) ([scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) has been enthralled by the aboleths lurking beneath the water in area C7. When a character approaches this area, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) urges them to come quickly, saying that Chimagua is dying and needs assistance. As soon as the first character reaches this area, she attacks. Any time [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) takes damage, she can make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw to escape the aboleths' control. If freed, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) points to the water and warns that the true threat is there, prompting the [aboleth](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) Glol to emerge and attack if the characters haven't already encountered that aboleth. If [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) is [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), the aboleths from area C7 emerge and attack.

##### The Sleeping Stone

The crystal is the Sleeping Stone, a magical device Chimagua once used to influence the dreams of Atagua's people. The power of the Drought Elder has corrupted the stone, forcing Chimagua into a deathly slumber and accelerating the planar instability in Atagua.

Any creature that touches the Sleeping Stone must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (`12d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Regardless of the saving throw result, the creature also receives the following grim vision:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Within an expanse of broken worlds drifts a gargantuan alien form—one that is far from a centipede yet closer to that shape than any other. The shape is shattered and crawling with convulsing, bipedal parasites. Despite the shape's ruin, the darkness within one of its hollow eyes deepens and fixates. It sees you.
^4e7

#### C7: Polluted Pool

Two [aboleths](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md), Glol and Kilzilg, lurk in the brackish but mundane waters of this pool. These servants of the Drought Elder infiltrated the tepui and used their master's magic to corrupt Chimagua and the Sleeping Stone. When [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) arrived, they took control of her. They are using the warrior to watch Chimagua's final days.

The aboleths prefer to stay in the cavern's foul water, which heavily obscures them while they're below the surface. If the aboleths are revealed or the characters enter the water, the aboleths attack. Both use their telepathy to threaten foes, promising eternities of desiccated doom within the Drought Elder's immortal corpse.

> [!note] Ghost Orchids
> 
> Manifestations of Chimagua's magic, these magical plants are unique to the tepui named after them. Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these [black seeds](Mechanics/items/black-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) is affected by the spell [feign death](Mechanics/spells/feign-death.md). If the creature is unaware of the pod's effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell.
> 
> More rarely, the orchids produce a smaller pod holding a single white seed. Among its various magical properties, if a [white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) is ground and scattered over a dead body, the body is affected by the [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md) spell. A [white ghost orchid seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) has no effect if consumed.
^ghost-orchids

## The Tepui's Fate

When the Drought Elder's minions in the Crystal Caves have been dealt with, the characters have a chance to talk to [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md). If [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) died during the encounter with the aboleths, Chimagua's spirit can telepathically reach out to the characters and convey the information [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) would have—see "[Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md)'s Hope" below.

Once the characters are out of danger, they might try to heal Chimagua. The great anaconda can't be revived by any ability or magic available to the characters. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check determines that a magical affliction affects Chimagua, and the guardian will die in the coming weeks if the affliction is allowed to run its course. [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) knows how to heal the great spirit, though.

### Yarana

Born nearly one thousand years ago in Atagua, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) (neutral good, human [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) was the most talented of the elite Cababa warriors of ancient times. Days before becoming her people's chief, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) and her faithful companion [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) were murdered by an envious rival. Their remains floated down the river Holroro and slipped into the realm of the Ghost Orchid Tepui. There, Chimagua found [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) and [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) and restored them to be protectors of the spirit's mountain. Over ages, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) has protected Chimagua and learned the ways of the Feywild. But everything changed in recent days when beings from the Far Realm attacked the Ghost Orchid Tepui.

[Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) would like to take a more active role in combating the threats to her original home, but her immortality is tied to the Feywild. If she leaves that plane, she will rapidly age and die after 24 hours. She risked this when she contacted the characters earlier only because of the dire circumstances to Chimagua.

#### Yarana's Hope

[Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) thanks the characters for undertaking her mission. She shares the rest of the story she began when she first contacted the characters, along with any information in the "Background" section:

- The Sleeping Stone, a focus of Chimagua's power, has sent the spirit visions of a Far Realm terror known as the Drought Elder that's trying to exert control over Atagua.  
- Recently, creatures from the Far Realm slipped from Atagua into the Ghost Orchid Tepui and attacked Chimagua.  
- The invaders broke the Sleeping Stone and spirited a piece of it away. This put Chimagua into a deathlike slumber.  
- [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) believes they returned the fragment to the Drought Elder, which is using it as a way to draw power from the nightmares of Atagua's people.  
- Only by recovering the missing piece of the Sleeping Stone might Chimagua be saved.  
- [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) believes the Drought Elder is vulnerable to Chimagua's magic, such as that of white ghost orchid seeds.  

[Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) beseeches the characters to help by stealing into the Drought Elder's domain and recovering the stolen Sleeping Stone fragment. She has little to offer them except for two [potions of healing (supreme)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-supreme-healing.md) and a pouch of Feywild herbs that functions as [Keoghtom's ointment](Mechanics/items/keoghtoms-ointment.md), but she suspects Chimagua will reward them handsomely if they aid the spirit.

If pressed about the Drought Elder itself, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) knows only that it is a terrible being of desiccation and ruin. She doesn't know how to combat it, but she suggests the characters takes the [white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod from the Ghost Orchid in area C5. Since the white seed pods hold the power of rebirth, perhaps it can be used against an entity of decay.

### Opening a Path

Reaching the Drought Elder in the Far Realm is no easy task. While spells like [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) can convey characters to the Far Realm, reaching the unfathomable entity requires a more precise method of travel. But [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) has a plan:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A relic of Atagua's past holds the key to reaching the Drought Elder," [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) says. "The *Hammock of Worlds* once allowed people to visit Chimagua, using the Ghost Orchid Tepui's connection to Atagua. But with the Far Realm's influence affecting the land, the hammock could likely follow those corrupted planar connections as well, creating a path to the Drought Elder. But if it's to work, we must move quickly."
^4ee

[Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) shares the following information, explaining how to recover the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md):

- The *Hammock of Worlds* is held by one of the most ancient beings in Atagua, the Dawn Mother.  
- The Dawn Mother is an ageless giant that wanders the Llanos and is said to call forth the sun every morning. She frequents an oasis called the Basket. Although she's aloof, she loves the land and is sure to help.  
- Once the characters have the hammock, they must take it to the mystics known as the Green Doctors at the Silver Tapir Monastery.  
- [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) can't come with the characters because her immortality is tied to the Feywild (see the "Yarana" section).  

![Hammock of Worlds](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/141-14-004.hammock-of-worlds.webp#center)

## Back across the Llanos

Once the characters are ready to return to Atagua, [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) escorts them back to the portal they used to reach the tepui. [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) travels with them through the portal, carrying with him a message to the Green Doctors. Upon returning through the portal, the characters find themselves back in the field of termite mounds in eastern Atagua. The macaw swiftly departs to deliver his message to the Silver Tapir Monastery.

The Basket is 30 miles from the portal, a journey that takes one full day and a quarter of the next at a normal pace. The fastest route by land is via the Grassroads. During this journey, the characters might encounter any of the sights mentioned in the "Journey across the Llanos" section from earlier in the adventure.

### Sugar Bug

As the characters near the Basket, they encounter an iridescent-hued [thri-kreen](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thri-kreen.md) hurrying along the Grassroads in the opposite direction. The thri-kreen hails the characters and explains that her people need help. If the characters agree to listen, she rapidly shares the following information:

- The thri-kreen's name is Cht-Chak, and she's a leader of a nomadic band of thri-kreen traders who deal in panela.  
- Her people were camped at the Basket when a terrible storm appeared out of nowhere.  
- Soon after, a terrifying, root-covered giant—the Dawn Mother—appeared and attacked her people without provocation.  
- Cht-Chak is desperately trying to find help.  

If pressed for details, Cht-Chak explains she's never seen the Dawn Mother act like this. She's willing to pay the characters to help her band, though she can offer only a load of panela worth 200 gp. She can, however, lead the characters directly to the Dawn Mother.

### The Dawn Mother

It takes Cht-Chak and the characters only a few hours to reach the Basket and, from there, to follow a trail of lightning scorches to where the Dawn Mother still pursues a group of thri-kreen. Read the following as the characters approach:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Numerous thri-kreen dash through the tall grass, attempting to avoid the steps of a massive figure. A gigantic, ancient woman dressed in thick tree roots and vines stomps after the mantis-folk. Amid her roaring, she occasionally plucks a sizable seed pod from her garb and chucks it after her quarry.
^4f2

The hostile [storm giant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) chasing the thri-kreen is the Dawn Mother. Although the giant has long been a stoic guardian of the Llanos, her recent dreams of otherworldly insects have confused and enraged her. Fearing the thri-kreen are to blame, she has attacked Cht-Chak's innocent band.

If attacked, the Dawn Mother turns her rage on whoever harmed her. Her rage continues until she is reduced 50 hit points or fewer, after which she comes to her senses and stops attacking. Characters can also use an action to talk her down, then make a DC 22 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Succeeding on this check once dulls her fury, while two successful checks cause the Dawn Mother to stop attacking.

#### Consulting with the Dawn Mother

Once the Dawn Mother comes to her senses, she apologizes for her rage and explains that she's been suffering terrible dreams. If asked for the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md), she rummages amid the vines covering her and produces it. If the characters explain why they need it, she's eager to help them and not only gives them the hammock but also leads them to the Silver Tapir Monastery.

If the Dawn Mother is calmed or defeated, Cht-Chak thanks the characters and rewards them. If the characters kill the giant, Cht-Chak helps them retrieve the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) from the giant's body and directs them to the Silver Taper Monastery.

### The Hammock of Worlds

The [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs. It functions as a [well of many worlds](Mechanics/items/well-of-many-worlds.md) with two exceptions:

- It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.  
- The portal it creates can connect only to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user's choice)—the two planes linked to Atagua.  

Any member of the Green Doctors at the Silver Tapir Monastery can use the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md).

## Silver Tapir Monastery

The Silver Tapir Monastery is approximately 15 miles from the Basket, a journey that takes 5 hours at a normal pace. As the characters approach, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A large, oxidized silver statue of a tapir stands before a broad stone structure covered in carvings of stylized local animals—tapirs, capybaras, hawks, and more. Dozens of people stand outside the building, many wearing distinctive green sashes.
^4f6

An elder Green Doctor named Melecio (neutral good, elf [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) steps from the crowd, with [Nene](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nene-jttrc.md) perched on her shoulder. Melecio explains that the Green Doctors have been expecting them and shares the following information:

- Melecio understands the characters have been sent to fetch the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) and seek to use it to travel to the Far Realm. She believes this can be done—though it hasn't been tried before.  
- The [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) is traditionally employed only at dusk during a ritual dance, one the Green Doctors are prepared to host this coming dusk.  
- At Melecio's invitation, leaders from across Atagua are gathering to represent their people during this rare, important ritual.  
- Melecio can also share details on the Green Doctors and legends from the "Atagua Gazetteer" section.  

Until the ritual, the characters are welcome to rest and prepare for their journey. Green Doctors (neutral good, human [priests](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) can use their magic to heal the characters during this time.

The Sugar Man is among the leaders who arrive to participate in the dance. He asks if the characters retrieved a [white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod for him. If the characters did not, or choose not to give it to him, he is disappointed but understanding. Otherwise, he pays them the agreed-upon price.

### The Portal Ritual

At sunset, the ritual for travel through the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) begins:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two wizened trees stand before the Silver Tapir Monastery, their ancient boughs lit by dusk light. Between them stretches the *Hammock of Worlds*, its patterned fabric loose and empty. Soon the Green Doctors and other visitors who have come to participate in the ritual begin a rhythmic drumming. All around the monastery, the dance begins, with the sound of drums, flutes, harps, and chants rising. Mystics, people from nearby villages, thri-kreen travelers, and even enthusiastic capybaras shuffle and gyrate in time to the music. As they do, the hammock sags and an otherworldly glow emanates from within it.
^4f8

At the height of the ritual, Melecio uses the hammock to open a portal to the Far Realm. When the characters are ready, they can pass through the portal, arriving inside the Drought Elder (area D1).

![The dessicated husk of the...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/142-14-005.dessicated-husk.webp#center "The dessicated husk of the Drought Elder endlessly drifts through a lifeless void in the Far Realm")

## The Drought Elder

The Drought Elder rots within a region of the Far Realm filled with shadows and dead stars. Characters who pass through the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) emerge within the gigantic, lifeless, yet still malicious being. The Drought Elder cannot move, but it is aware of creatures within itself and uses its powerful telepathy to read their thoughts. However, as an immortal being that embodies unfathomable forces of apathy, desiccation, and planar dissolution, it doesn't actively impede the characters or attempt to communicate with them. It can feed information to any of the various aberrations infesting its body, though.

### Drought Elder Features

Areas within the Drought Elder have the following features:

#### Carapace Exterior

Characters can access the exterior of the Drought Elder's carapace from areas D3 and D5. It can be climbed by any creature that succeeds on a DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. However, traveling outside the carapace beyond area D3 or `D5` attracts the attention of `1d3` [whistlers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) every minute. These whistlers are hostile.

- **Ceiling.** The ceilings within the Drought Elder are 20 feet high.  
- **Darkness.** The interior of the Drought Elder is not illuminated; its occupants rely on [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume that the characters have a light source or some other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Floor and Walls.** The floor and walls are made of moist, russet chitin. Any 5-foot-square, 1-foot-thick segment of chitin has AC 12, 60 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If damaged, a section of chitin unleashes a wave of psychic pain. Each creature within 15 feet of the damaged chitin must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 17 (`5d6`) psychic damage.  
- **Spiracles.** Holes in the walls allow fetid air to cycle through the Drought Elder's interior. Peering through these spiracles reveals the Drought Elder's body and an endless alien void beyond.  

### Navigating the Drought Elder

The following areas are keyed to map 14.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 14.3: The Drought Elder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/143-map-14.3-the-drought-elder.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/144-map-14.3-the-drought-elder-player.webp#gallery)

#### D1: Egg Chamber

Characters who pass through the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) have the feeling of jolting awake from a dream, then emerge into the Drought Elder standing up. Read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air is dense and humid. Slick, chitinous walls rise around you, forming a space that feels like the interior of some vast, insectile organ. Dozens of pale, oblong masses lie piled at the room's center, and a curved passage leads out of the space. Nearby, a glowing, oval portal leads back to Atagua.
^4ff

A character who investigates the walls and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation) or [Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes they're inside some gigantic creature, though it doesn't seem to be alive.

##### Eggs

A heap of oblong insect eggs filled with swirling, psychedelic colors fills the center of the room. These eggs are a manifestation of the dream energy the Drought Elder is stealing from Atagua. The eggs are easily broken; each has AC 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. If they're destroyed, the energy within dissipates, leaving the closest creature with a fleeting impression of a dream belonging to someone from Atagua.

##### Egg Sucker

A moment after the characters arrive, a [whistler](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) enters the chamber from area D2, moves to the pile of eggs, cracks one open, and feeds on the energy within. It ignores the characters unless attacked.

##### Portal

A creature that enters the portal emerges back at the Silver Tapir Monastery through the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md).

#### D2: Dead End

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This short tunnel ends in a wall of pallid meat, devoid of the thick chitin covering the other walls.
^504

If a creature approaches what appears to be the tunnel's end, hundreds of saucer-sized eyes with fanged pupils open and begin repeating a random character's name. The wall is a [gibbering mouther](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) controlled by the Drought Elder. It moves out of the way for any Aberration, revealing a 5-foot-diameter gap in the wall, but it attacks any other creature. Destroying the gibbering mouther leaves the gap in the wall unguarded.

#### D3: Void Striders

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The structure falls away, opening into a void filled with floating chunks of insectile parts. Hundreds of feet away, a similar opening gapes in the other half of the massive body. That segment ends at a wide, cave-like mouth.
^506

Part of the Drought Elder's body has been shattered, reduced to a mass of broken chitin islands floating between the two halves of its body.

##### Shattered Path

Five-foot-square chunks of chitin drift in this area of low gravity between the two halves of the Drought Elder. The pieces stay 10 feet apart. Any creature that can't fly through the area must leap between these platforms. The low gravity doubles the distance creatures can jump. However, any creature that jumps must make a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a successful check, the creature lands in the intended spot. On a failed check, the creature lands 5 feet away from its intended spot and is suspended in the area's strange gravity. Suspended creatures are [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) until they use an action to pull themselves onto a nearby platform or until an adjacent creature uses an action to help them to stable ground.

- **Servants of Dissolution.** Drifting amid the shattered body is an old and withered [beholder](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) called Ozk. It blends in well amid the floating meat and has advantage on its Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks. If Ozk notices any non-Aberration, it stops meditating on its own decay and attacks, shouting in Deep Speech that the characters should "welcome the endless" and "escape the tyranny of breath."  

#### D4: Vestige of Consciousness

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The chitinous tunnel widens into a domed, circular area. At its center, a ring of strange runes is etched into the ground. The symbols move, crawling in a circle. Above them hovers a mass of insectile limbs encompassing an alien light. Beyond it, a narrow passage opens into the vast void outside.
^509

A vestige of the Drought Elder's obscene consciousness lingers here. Beyond, its maw opens into the void.

##### Runes

The runes are manifestations of the Drought Elder's obsessive thoughts. They're written in Deep Speech and change constantly. A creature who reads them realizes they recount terrifying ends for Atagua and Chimagua, and that creature must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature shakes off the horror. On a failure, the creature is [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned), and the words change to name that creature. The [stunned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Stunned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### Nexus of Dissolution

A sphere the size of a human head and composed of oversized centipede limbs encompasses a foul light. This sphere is a fraction of the Drought Elder's alien consciousness. It uses the [demilich](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/demilich.md) stat block but is an Aberration rather than Undead. It ignores the characters unless they try to harm it or try to enter area D5—either through this area or via another route. This nexus of the Drought Elder's being is vulnerable to Chimagua's power. If it comes into contact with a seed from a [ghost orchid's white seed](Mechanics/items/white-ghost-orchid-seed-jttrc.md) pod, it and the pod are destroyed instantly.

##### Maw

A gap lined with dull mandibles opens into area D5. The tiny mouth-parts twitch occasionally but are harmless.

#### D5: Mandible Walk

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Massive mandibles extend from the dead mass of the alien husk. Between their tips hovers a starlike crystal.
^50e

Approximately 40 feet from the Drought Elder's maw hangs the Sleeping Stone shard, twinkling between the being's two gigantic mandibles. The Drought Elder's servants avoid this area, fearing that their master might awake and consume them.

##### Void Walk

Creatures that can fly can easily reach and recover the fist-sized crystal. Alternatively, a creature that succeeds on a DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check can climb the Drought Elder's exterior and mandibles. Any creature that falls from the mandibles or is knocked into the void begins slowly drifting away from the Drought Elder at a rate of 10 feet per round. Unless the creature has a tether thrown to it or is recovered by another flying creature, it gradually drifts out of sight and is lost.

##### Sleeping Stone Shard

The fragment of the Sleeping Stone is weightless and contains a portion of the dreams of Chimagua. The first creature to touch the crystal must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or fall [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for `1d4` minutes as the creature's mind is overwhelmed by visions. An [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature begins drifting away from the Drought Elder. Once the stone has been touched, though, the psychic energy stored within is expelled, and the stone can be touched safely.

#### Escaping the Drought Elder

Once the characters have claimed the shard of the Sleeping Stone, they must still return to Atagua. The Drought Elder does nothing to physically impede the characters, but it telepathically urges the creatures inhabiting its massive corpse to attack the intruders. At your discretion, additional pairs of [whistlers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/whistler-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) and groups of `2d4` [gibbering mouthers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) menace the characters as they return to the portal.

## Conclusion

When the characters return to Atagua, Melecio greets them and can use the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) to speed them back to the Ghost Orchid Tepui. There, they find [Yarana](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/yarana-jttrc.md) attending the weakening Chimagua. If the fragment of the Sleeping Stone is restored to the whole, the crystal glows in a rainbow of colors. Chimagua awakens with full awareness of what the characters have done, having dreamed the characters' adventures. The spirit thanks the characters and awards them a [lesser version](Mechanics/items/lesser-hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md) of the [Hammock of Worlds](Mechanics/items/hammock-of-worlds-jttrc.md). This magic item functions as a [well of many worlds](Mechanics/items/well-of-many-worlds.md), but the user can cause it to always reliably connect to the Ghost Orchid Tepui.

With the tepui's magic and guardian restored, the nightmares and Far Realm incursions plaguing Atagua cease. If the characters return to Atagua later, people across the land know of their heroics, and they're celebrated wherever they go. Some may seek out the heroes, hoping they can solve other threats facing the land.

## Atagua Gazetteer

Much of Atagua consists of grasslands, wetlands, and narrow stretches of tropical forests bordering the Holroro River. Two extreme seasons each year of intense rain and dusty drought have shaped this land and blessed its people with resilience. They live, work, and tell stories in villages built on platforms or in sprawling hacienda estates surrounded by sugarcane fields or cacao orchards. Though their villages might be separated by many miles, Ataguans meet each other in their dreams due to the connections between this land and a mystical mountain in the Feywild.

For nearly two hundred years, the people of Atagua have thrived, peacefully trading among diverse outposts connected by the Grassroads—a system of walkways elevated to protect from floods, fires, and other threats and engineered by the ancient Flood People who first settled these lands. Yet danger remains. In some years, the rains that end the dry season are late, increasing the risk of wildfires. [Bulettes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) and other predators shadow travelers on the Grassroads or stalk the [thri-kreen](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/thri-kreen.md) folk who wander the Llanos. And among the Green Doctors, a guild of healers and scholars, old tales warn of strange whistling creatures that sometimes pass into Atagua from dark realms—and that might someday emerge in unstoppable numbers to consume this land.

### Atagua Features

Those familiar with Atagua know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** This land is known for the chocolate and sugar produced there and for the elevated walkways that traverse its forests and tropical savannas. Folk there experience vivid dreams, often of an invisible, flat-topped mountain .  
- **People of Atagua.** Ataguans are predominantly humans with tan to dark-brown complexions, along with smaller numbers of dark-skinned forest gnomes and tieflings, the latter of whom typically bear three horns. Nomadic clans of thri-kreen with iridescent carapaces also wander the Llanos; they're rarely encountered in towns and cities.  
- **Languages.** Quirapu is the language of Atagua, a melded derivative of the original languages of the Flood People who first settled these lands and the colonizers who came after them. All folk of Atagua also speak Common.  

### Noteworthy Sites

Atagua is a rugged country of tropical grassland plains and gallery forests—a great savanna known locally as the Llanos. Spread across the basin of the twisting Holroro River, the peoples of this land dwell in scattered outposts connected by walkways called the Grassroads.

#### The Grassroads

The Grassroads are a system of elevated, 15-foot-wide roads ranging from 5 to 20 feet in height and punctuated by lean-to shelters; the roads and shelters alike are constructed from wood, reeds, and stone. The folk of Atagua use these roads to ensure safe passage above the many hazards of the Llanos. Traders and farmers walk the roads day and night, protected by the elite fighter-scouts known as Cababa warriors, who patrol constantly for poachers and bandits. Thri-kreen can often be found scavenging the ground beneath the pathways for items dropped from above. They then trade these items for panela—cones of brown sugar cooked in mills across Atagua.

#### El Caparazón

Hundreds of farming villages dot the Llanos, bordered by sugarcane fields and orchards of cacao trees. El Caparazón ("The Shell") is the largest of these settlements and the capital of Atagua. It was named for a latticework partial dome built by the Flood People hundreds of years ago. The dome provides precious shade to the central square known as the Mercado Sucre and to a grand hacienda roofed with amber-hued tiles. Called the Sugar Alcázar, this hacienda is home to Alfonz Rubinaz-Zumdi, the powerful landowner known as the Sugar Man.

About 5 miles outside the city, Port Panela serves as Atagua's port. It boasts dozens of wooden docks as well as thatched huts on stilted platforms, and the harbor teems with sleek trade boats returning or departing with sugar, cacao, goods, and travelers.

#### The Outposts

Three remote settlements, collectively known as "the outposts," are home to the most notable factions of Atagua. One is a busy encampment that serves as a base for the Tribe of Builders, the engineers and workers who repair and extend the Grassroads. Every six years they rebuild this encampment, which they affectionately call the Devil's Hammock. The second outpost was once the El Chapán rum distillery; after it closed down long ago, it became a trading post for the thri-kreen of the Llanos. The third outpost is the Silver Tapir Monastery, which serves as the sanctuary and school of the Green Doctors.

### Life in Atagua

Those who live in Atagua or travel through the Llanos are shaped by the following truths.

#### Hard-Won Independence

Nearly five hundred years ago, an invading force rolled across the Llanos of Atagua, thereafter invading the neighboring region of San Citlán. But after three centuries of occupation, the mixed descendants of the Flood People who first settled Atagua and former invaders who made peace with them decisively expelled their would-be rulers after a thirteen-year war of independence. Atagua's people are the result of the multigenerational intermingling between the native Flood People, the descendants of invaders who rebelled against their leaders and settled here, and a steady stream of new immigrants and adventurers drawn to the freedom and challenges of life on the Llanos.

The aftermath of war was marked by a vibrant rebuilding period. Large settlements such as El Caparazón retained some of the cultural aspects of the long colonial occupation, while rural villages primarily drew on the legacy of the Flood People.

Even after two centuries of peace, tensions sometimes arise between clans and factions due to feuds and the revival of ancient grudges. These conflicts flare but are resolved through hard work, patient negotiations, and compromises by all sides. Overall, the people of Atagua embrace the idea that they form a complicated, diverse culture—and that together, they will shape a hopeful future.

#### Lives of the People

Sugar and chocolate are abundant in the cuisine of Atagua, especially in the favored beverages: drinking chocolate, strong coffee, and even stronger rum sweetened with panela—the cooked-down juice of sugarcane. Corn, black beans, and plantains are the cornerstones of every meal, and arepas—grilled buns made from ground corn—are eaten by the wealthy and the poor alike.

The folk of this land work hard by day, but they mark each noon as the start of the siesta, which offers a much-needed respite from the midday heat. People retire to the shade of haciendas or huts, to rest or quietly gather with their closest kin, for it is said that only the untrustworthy conduct their affairs under the blistering midday sun. And when work is done, evenings explode with social activity and music.

Cropped cotton trousers, long-sleeve tunics, long and loose sleeveless jackets known as gilets, full skirts, and straw hats are everyday dress for people of all genders in Atagua. Geometric tattoos or angular designs painted with butterfly-based pigments are commonplace on faces and hands. And the Cababa warriors and the workers of the Tribe of Builders bear accessories made from feathers and flowers, paired with snakeskin kilts.

#### Faith and Fortune

Religion in Atagua revolves around the Suwa, a shifting pantheon of hundreds of folk heroes. Small, colorful statues of Suwa heroes are found everywhere in Atagua and are honored with offerings of rum or sweets. Ataguans are tolerant of different beliefs and often adopt legendary figures from other cultures into the Suwa.

#### The Green Doctors

The collective of mystics known as the Green Doctors weaves together knowledge of magic and herbal medicine to heal the people and creatures of Atagua. The leader of their order is an elf named Melecio. Green Doctors are recognized by the green sash they wear around their waists, but any healer, mage, or storyteller can study medicine at the order's home, the Silver Tapir Monastery.

#### Names

Some Ataguan names honor the ancestral heroes of the Flood People, while others are derived by mixing those names with ones from the colonial past. In addition to given names, insightful nicknames from a person's childhood often linger into adulthood. The following are examples of such names:

- **Feminine.** Cruz, Tibísay, Yamaira, Zulibeth  
- **Masculine.** Estwaldo, Jecson, Oru, Payaro  
- **Gender-Neutral.** Ara, Riaguey, Tamí, Zamiri  
- **Nicknames.** Arrow, Little Toucan, Orchid, Quipper  
- **Surnames.** Periro, Secuentes, Táreru, Zárates  

### Legends of Atagua

Ataguans dream vividly of a great tepui—a tabletop mountain surrounded by jungle. Though the site is unseen and unreachable, many claim the shared experience of having explored the mesa in their dreams, seeing others like themselves in passing, and meeting otherworldly beings.

The secret behind these dreams is found in the oldest legends, which speak of the Ghost Orchid Tepui existing simultaneously in the Llanos and in the Feywild, parallel to Atagua. The source of the dreams is a powerful crystal called the Sleeping Stone, which many who dream have seen, alongside magical white orchids growing in the crystalline caverns below the tepui's summit.

As counterpoint to these bright dreams, sinister creatures haunt the history of Atagua. During the war of independence, rattling whistles rose from the Llanos at night. As the fighting increased, the whistling manifested near villages and haciendas, inspiring nightmares or incurable despair for those who survived hearing it. Some reported seeing hunched giants from the corner of the eye—a new threat to terrorize a war-weary people.

When the fighting ended and Atagua was free once more, the nightmares ended. The menacing whistlers were largely forgotten as the peoples of Atagua embraced peace and reconstruction. But even today, whistlers occasionally appear in the Llanos, evidence that the Far Realm still influences the land. And some among the Green Doctors whisper that Atagua might yet face an invasion by those terrors.

### Characters from Atagua

If players want to create characters from Atagua, ask them the following questions:

**Have you traveled far in Atagua?** Are you familiar with the Grassroads? Do you have contacts among thri-kreen traders?

**Are your dreams remarkable?** Have you had visions of serpentine dream spirits or strange flowers? Do you have nightmares of terrible insects? Do you not dream at all?

**Have you interacted with the Green Doctors**? Did they heal you, or a dear friend or family member? Have you learned about traditional magic from them?

## Whistler

Whistlers are inscrutable stalkers hailing from airy, screeching reaches of the Far Realm. They are difficult to see as they're not tethered to one point in space, blurring in a state of perpetual physical uncertainty. A dead whistler appears as a gray, featureless, humanlike biped with long limbs and thin fingers. Those stalked by a whistler can't shut out its soundless, seven-note tune, an otherworldly melody that invades and scourges the mind. Few creatures that encounter a whistler escape; those that do are forever haunted by the stalker's frightful tune.
