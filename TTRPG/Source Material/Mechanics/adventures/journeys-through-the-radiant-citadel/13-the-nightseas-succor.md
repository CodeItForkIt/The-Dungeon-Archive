# The Nightsea's Succor
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 168* 

*An Adventure for 12th-Level Characters*

After experiencing a mysterious haunting, the characters become embroiled in a quest to restore lost lore to the realm of Djaynai. As they journey from the misty coast of Djaynai to the phantasmagoric realm of Janya beneath the sea, the characters discover not all folk are of one mind concerning the mysterious Djaynaian teachings called the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts. Some believe these mystical practices and defensive martial strategies should be restored to reestablish the power Djaynai held in the past. Others believe they should only be used as the basis for new arts and then retired. Still others want the lost lore destroyed so Djaynai and Janya can break from the past that binds them. Ultimately, the characters must decide which path to follow and face a forgotten terror in the deepest reaches of the Nightsea.

## Background

In centuries past, the people of Djaynai employed mystical practices known as the Blackmist Way and defensive martial strategies called the Blackthrone Arts to protect their land. During a period called the Passage of Vultures, raiders assailed the nation and kidnapped its people. Many of those captured escaped into the ocean to found a new aquatic realm called Janya. These escapees included the most skilled practitioners of both arts, but the writings that recorded their lore were lost.

Recently, the People's Stewards, the leaders of Djaynai, enacted the Will of the Insurgent Tides, a collective vow to restore the glorious knowledge and traditions of Djaynai's past. As [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md), leader of the People's Stewards, seeks aid in finding lost evidence of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, sinister forces near the undersea city of Janya have roused the spirits defending this lost wisdom. Now these wayward souls travel far to find aid in their homeland, hoping to prevent their people's ancient wisdom from being turned to wicked ends.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Djaynai and Janya in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive in a clearing 5 miles upriver from Djaynai. If you wish to further detail these lands, use the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section at this adventure's end as a starting point.  
- **Forgotten Realms.** Djaynai could lie among the Nelanther islands or be a new island realm in the Trackless Sea.  
- **Greyhawk.** Consider setting Djaynai along the coast of Hepmonaland or as an influential land anywhere along the Azure Sea.  

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure:

- **Ancestor's Invitation.** A character's relative or associate is a local official who lives in Djaynai. This contact has received strange dreams in which the spirit of one of their ancestors tries to communicate with them. The contact asks the character to visit them in Djaynai to help them unravel the mystery of their ancestor's message.  
- **Defending the Land.** Djaynai's leaders often employ experienced adventurers to exchange knowledge and magic with Djaynaian scouts and defenders. Based on the characters' previous exploits, high-ranking Djaynaian officials request the characters share their expertise.  
- **Lore Masters.** An ally in Djaynai or someone who recently visited the city has heard talk of unusual sightings of spirits there. This ally connects the characters to an official who knows more about the spirit sightings and arranges for them to visit.  

## Starting the Adventure

![Castle Djaynai monitors th...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/112-12-001.castle-djaynai.webp#center "Castle Djaynai monitors the arrival of travelers to the fog-shrouded port of Djaynai")

The adventure begins with the characters arriving in the city of Djaynai. Whoever arranged for the adventurers to come to the city has paid for their ship's passage, as well as for rooms at a fine inn on arrival. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ship passes through swirling fog that parts to reveal distant cliffs. A port emerges from the mist, nestled among mangroves. Elaborate mud-brick buildings in chalky pastel colors line the shore. A grand mud-brick castle bristling with wooden supports and adorned with pilasters dominates the skyline.
^3c3

A porter cowled in flowing damask-and-linen fabric greets the characters and offers to escort them to their inn: Anadoua's Rest House, a well-appointed, two-story, mud-brick building painted pale blue. The characters have a full day to rest and explore Djaynai before they meet with the official who arranged their journey at Castle Djaynai. Map 12.1 depicts the central portion of the city of Djaynai, near where the characters are staying.

Anadoua, a friendly, well-dressed human woman, owns the inn and attends to the characters. Each is given a private room, and delicious meals are prepared and served in the common room. Anadoua is happy to share details from the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section or direct the characters toward the market for any mundane items they require.

## The Restless Dead

After the characters retire for the night, the quiet of Anadoua's Rest House is disturbed. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Distant music provides an almost hypnotic undertone to a calm night. Then shouts ring out, shattering the peace. Someone's calling for help!
^3c5

The characters can tell the shouts are coming from the inn's common room. Following the sound, the characters find the common room lightly obscured, filled with swirling mist. The haze makes the area feel like it's full of fog and floating on a stormy sea. Staff and other patrons who've stumbled out of their rooms are frightened by the sight.

Amid the mist are two terrified figures who cry out, saying "Please, they're coming after us!" and "We can't lose them again!" These [haints](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haint-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) are spirits murdered during the Passage of Vultures. They've both taken on the lifelike appearances of the artisans they were in life and seek to escape the wicked souls who hold them captive in death. Their sorrow causes them to fear the characters are allies of the invaders who murdered them.

Before the haints can say much, or after 1 round of combat, a [wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) that looks like a faceless sea raider manifests near them. This is the spirit of one of the wicked captors the haints are trying to escape. The wraith looks around, then signals toward the characters. If the haints haven't already attacked, they back away from the wraith and reluctantly join it in attacking the characters. All three Undead attack until the wraith is destroyed.

### Spirits' Plea

When the wraith is defeated, any surviving haints remain, lingering in the center of the common room. If both haints were destroyed, their voices emerge from silhouettes drifting in the lingering mist. The spirits apologize for any harm they caused and entreat the characters for help, sharing the following information:

- Their names are Derek and Violette.  
- They were separated from their families and taken from their homes in Djaynai long ago.  
- The ship they were on, the *Girscamen*, sank, and they were lost to the sea, along with important tomes they were protecting.  
- Something wicked recently disturbed their remains and claimed the lore they were guarding.  
- The wraith was one of the haints' captors. The haints are free now, but the tomes they protected are in danger.  
- They entreat the characters to help them by finding their resting place and reclaiming the tomes. Only when that knowledge is safe can they find true peace.  

Before the spirits can answer all the characters' questions, the mist filling the common room swirls faster, and the characters hear the distant sound of howling wind and pounding waves. The spirits cry out, "Something terrible threatens our precious lore. Please help us, or our people's secrets will be lost forever!" Then the mist roils away to nothing and the haints vanish. The common room returns to normal, but where the spirits vanished, two puddles of water remain, each forming a distinctive sigil. They're clearly visible for a minute before drying.

### What Was Lost

Characters who succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recognize that the sigils represent the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts: two local traditions lost during the Passage of Vultures. Any local in the common room or resident of Djaynai who sees a copy of the symbols can identify them and share the basics about these lost traditionsâ€“as described in the "Background" section of the adventure.

The name *Girscamen* holds no meaning to anyone.

If questioned, Anadoua is baffled by what's occurred. No other spiritual manifestation has occurred at her inn during the thirty years she's owned it.

## Castle Djaynai

The next morning, guards wearing long black tunics wait to escort the characters to their meeting at Castle Djaynai. The guards are members of Djaynai's elite reconnaissance patrol, called the Lightsea Lancers. They are formal and encourage the characters not to dawdle.

As the characters near Castle Djaynai, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The onyx-colored Castle Djaynai towers over the surrounding structures. It is built of mud bricks and studded with the projecting ends of wooden supports. Stern guards stand watch alongside an open gate.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/114-map-12.1-central-djaynai-player.webp#gallery)

### Meeting Atiba-Pa

The characters' escorts lead them through magnificent corridors lined with glass-encased lights. Their trip ends in a tapestry-lined hall whose floor is covered in luxurious rugs. Instead of the official they expected to meet, they see a somber human man with gray hair wearing purple robes and sitting on a central rug among several books and sheafs of paper. As the guards retreat, the man introduces himself as [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md), regent of the People's Stewards, and he thanks the characters for coming as he beckons them to join him.

#### Atiba-Pa

[Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) (lawful good, human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) is a former Lightsea Lancer and Djaynai's current regent. He is known not only for his falcon-eyed shrewdness but also for his compassion and kindness.

Those close to him know he suffers bleak moods, during which it is challenging to obtain an audience with him. Yet during those times, he is still kind to those he meets, even as he speaks sparse and sorrowful words. [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) fears that the Djaynaians' ancient traditions are lost forever, and that their loss puts his homeland at risk. Hearing of others' commitment to reclaiming lost lore acts as a balm for his bleak moods.

##### Personality Trait

"It isn't our way to simply treat guests with kindness. It is our way to welcome guests as family."

##### Ideal

"The nobility of each person's essence can never be sullied by the actions of others."

##### Bond

"It is my honor to serve my homeland. I will not pass beyond our borders for any reason."

##### Flaw

"I can't let them see me when I'm like this. The melancholy in my bones is mine alone to bear."

### Will of the People's Stewards

The characters originally planned to meet with a lower-ranked official of the People's Stewards. However, rumors of the events at Anadoua's Rest House reached [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md), and he decided to meet with the characters himself.

[Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) quickly dismisses the characters' original mission in Djaynai and asks them to recount what they saw the previous night. A sheaf of notes before him makes it clear he has heard the story already, but he records any new details the characters share. When the characters' account is complete, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) pauses thoughtfully, then shares the following information:

- The spirits called haints aren't uncommon in Djaynai, as spirits born of sorrow were spawned all too frequently during the Passage of Vultures.  
- The manifestation of the sigils connected to the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts is a noteworthy development, not seen elsewhere.  
- The appearance of these symbols is timely, as [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) and the People's Stewards believe now is the time to restore the traditions of Djaynai's pastâ€”an endeavor they refer to as the Will of the Insurgent Tides.  
- If the characters haven't already learned about the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) shares their history from the "Background" section.  

Before continuing, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) pauses and patiently answers any of the characters' questions before moving on to propose a theory. In answering questions, he can share any information from the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section.

### Atiba-Pa's Plan

Once the characters understand how meaningful [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) finds their encounter, he proceeds:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "For centuries, we have dreamed of reclaiming the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts so our people can defend their lands and our neighbors with all the strength of the past. I believe that you all have connections to Djaynai's ancestors... perhaps your roots or something gained in your life's journey. This drew the spirits to you, and we must learn why."
^3d2

Since hearing of the characters' encounter, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) has been engaged in research and verifying stories. Based on his investigations, he believes the following is true:

![Regent Atiba-Pa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/115-12-002.regent-atiba-pa.webp#center)

- The longship *Girscamen* was a raiding ship that captured Djaynaians took over and sank during the Passage of Vultures. The spirits the characters encountered likely died in the struggle before the ship sank.  
- Two great stone tomes holding the collected lore of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts were lost during the Passage of Vultures.  
- The sigils suggest some connection between this lost lore and the *Girscamen*.  
- The People's Stewards now hope the tomes were on the *Girscamen* and can be recovered from its wreck.  

[Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) explains that he wants the characters to find the wreck and any hint of Djaynai's lost lore still aboard. In return for finding the ship and whatever it holds, he will reward them with 3,000 gp and whatever they originally came seeking.

#### The Regent's Mission

[Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) admits that finding the *Girscamen* won't be easy. No one in Djaynai knows where the ship sank. However, the People's Regents know the undersea folk of Janya have detailed records of wreck sites and other points of interest around their undersea city. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check knows that Janya is an aquatic city populated by the [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md), an aquatic people descended from the people of Djaynai. [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) can also share this information and details about Janya from the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section. He solemnly speaks of the importance of recovering his people's lore:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "The Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts helped save Djaynai in the ancient past. Without that knowledge, who knows how we might fare if another threat comes to our shores? If you succeed in this mission, you will help ensure Djaynai's future by reclaiming the strength and traditions of the past." [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) then mutters, "If the Night Revelers don't drag us into chaos first."
^3d4

Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check know the Night Revelers are local philosopher-hedonists who embrace new ideals and oppose the People's Stewards. [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) can also share this information. He clearly views the group as misguided and encourages the characters to avoid contact with them.

#### Making Preparations

To help with the characters' journey to Janya, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) is having a sailboat called the *Beden-Moon*, crewed by Lightsea Lancers, prepared to sail at dawn. He also provides each character with a necklace of black cowrie shells. The necklaces are magic items that provide the same benefits as a [cloak of the manta ray](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-the-manta-ray.md), except each is activated or deactivated as a bonus action. The necklaces are historic relics of Djaynai, and [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) expects to get them back when the characters complete their mission.

The characters are free to do what they please for the rest of the day, and [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) has paid for their continued stay at Anadoua's Rest House. When the characters are ready to leave, [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) thanks them warmly and summons guards to escort the group from the castle.

## The Night Revelers

The characters are free to wander Djaynai while they prepare for their mission. At a point of your choosing, whether the characters are exploring the streets or resting at the inn, an agent of the Night Revelers visits them:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A figure wearing pale-blue robes approaches, her face obscured by a diaphanous blue veil. "The People's Stewards have lost their way," she whispers. "Many speak of your mystic experiences last night, of what they might mean, and of what causes are championed by those seemingly at the center of them."
^3d7

The whispering figure identifies herself only as "the Blue," and conveys the message that [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) of the Night Revelers has invited the characters to the Ancestors' Danse House for a meeting that night, at any time of the characters' convenience.

If the characters ask what [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) wants with them, the Blue says the meeting is to discuss the choice between "[Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md)'s folly and [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md)'s glorious revelry." The Blue then takes her leave.

If the characters ignore the summons, skip ahead to the "To the Nightsea" section.

## Ancestors' Danse House

Anyone in the city can provide directions to the Ancestors' Danse House, and the characters find it easily. The structure is a combination mausoleum and dance hall, a place where the living can both honor the departed and celebrate.

When the characters arrive, the Blue is waiting for them. She leads them past a pair of sentries into the chalk-white, mud-brick structure. Read the following when the characters enter:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A captivating drumbeat grows louder as the Blue leads you along a corridor set with archways, at the end of which a cavernous ballroom opens up. Half the space is filled with dancing people, but other figures stand along the sides, vigorously debating.
> 
> The Blue leads you to a nearly seven-foot-tall figure draped in a complex arrangement of robes and sashes. Speaking in a beautifully sonorous voice, the figure greets you. "Welcome! I am [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md), and we have much to discuss."
^3d9

### Djeneba

![Djeneba](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/116-12-003.djeneba.webp#center)

Mysterious and bright, with a unique mind that rapidly jumps from one subject to the next, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) (chaotic neutral, human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) is the charismatic voice of the Night Revelersâ€”and a person whose true identity is a mystery to all but the most devoted members of that anarchic group. [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md), who speaks with a honeyed tongue that makes others feel understood and embraced, has convinced an increasing number of Djaynaians to embrace the ways of the Night Revelers.

[Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) is exceptionally tall and always adorned head-to-toe in elaborate layers of form-obscuring gray and blue fabric. All other aspects of [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md)'s appearance and identity are unknown.

#### Personality Trait

"People sometimes have difficulty following my rapid shift in thoughts."

#### Ideal

"Indulging in all of life's pleasures is the path to serenity and freedom."

#### Bond

"The best way to honor our ancestors is to build a new future."

#### Flaw

"I know my thoughts are hard to follow, but even unfocused minds hold value."

### Djeneba's Curiosity

After leading the characters to a private corner of the ballroom set with fine couches, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) speaks wistfully of the past and more animatedly of the present and future. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- Ancient Djaynai was a wondrous place, its streets lined with alchemical lights and its people's hearts gilded with the peace of free living. But the past is gone, and it's not coming back.  
- Too many in Djaynai focus on the glories of the past, obsessed with searching for ancient lore that might restore that glory. The Night Revelers seek to surpass the heights of ancient Djaynai with new traditions.  

[Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) asks the characters about the spirits they saw, but quickly grows bored and excitedly changes the topic. "We will speak more, friends, but first, let us partake in the night revelry!"

#### The Night Revelry

[Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) dances into the crowd, away from the characters. Soon after, nearby musicians approach and encourage the characters to participate in the festivities with them, perhaps by dancing, drumming, or joining a group of Night Revelers in a vigorous debate.

##### Dancing

The dance of the Night Revelers involves graceful acrobatics and exuberance. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check performs the dance well. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character is lauded by the dancers around them, one of whom bestows the gift of a fine Djaynaian silk neck scarf.

##### Drumming

Joining in the percussion performance on one of the hall's large drums requires a character to make a DC 12 Charisma ([Performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance)) check. A character who succeeds impresses their fellow musicians and is allowed to keep a small, resonant [drum](Mechanics/items/drum.md).

##### Debating

Debating Night Revelers engage in spirited arguments regarding gradations between states of anarchy and freedom. A character who engages them and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or a DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check impresses the philosophers. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character stuns the group with some insight, and several philosophers ask the character to sign their favorite journals.

#### Djeneba's Offer

After the characters interact with the Night Revelers or an hour passes, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) circles back to them. If none of the characters interacted with the Night Revelers, or all the characters failed at their attempts to dance, drum, or debate, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) admits having forgotten about the characters and invites them to leaveâ€”clearly, they aren't Night Reveler material.

If one or more characters succeed on their checks to dance, drum, or debate, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) is impressed and pulls the characters aside to share the following information:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Word comes to [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) of meetings between the so-called People's Stewards and adventurers, yes? And whispers of sigils seen where the spirits of the past are wrought to life by ancient pain. [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) knows those sigils as well as I. But I offer you a chance to turn from his empty past and help build the future for Djaynai."
^3e6

[Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) assumes [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) hired the characters to seek the lore of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, and makes a counteroffer:

- If the characters find the lore of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, they should bring it to the Night Revelers instead of the People's Stewards.  
- The Night Revelers hope to take these ancient traditions and forge them into something more powerful.  
- With this new power, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) promises the people of Djaynai will be so scintillatingly free that no marauder would dare come to their shores except to engage in the revelry.  

[Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) promises the characters a reward of 4,000 gp and a place of honor among the Night Revelers in return for the lore. If the characters seem reluctant to answer, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) tells them to take their time. The leader offers the characters the use of private rooms in the Ancestors' Danse House, as well as a chance to join in the revelry until the night is spent.

If the party refuses the offer, [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) says the characters may yet change their minds if they see firsthand the pain the past carries with it.

## To the Nightsea

However the characters spend the night, the same guards who took them to Castle Djaynai the previous morning come to Anadoua's Rest House at dawn to escort them to the docks to board the *Beden-Moon*. If the characters didn't stay at the inn, the guards find them on the street and hasten them to the ship.

Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters reach the docks:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beneath the pink dawn sky, a swift-looking, double-masted vessel floats in the aquamarine water. Two wiry figures wearing green-blue armor and matching silk cloaks stand on the deck. One looks dour, the other cheerful.
^3e8

The boat is a beden-safar, a common vessel in Djaynai. The figures on board are Lightsea Lancers, skilled local scouts and sailors. They wear their hair in natural locs and have warm brown skin.

As the characters approach, the cheerful Lancer introduces himself as Gurau (neutral good, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)). He is friendly and explains that the two have been informed of the characters' mission and are eager to help. His brooding companion, Kisaroua (neutral good, human [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)), encourages the characters to board swiftly so they can embark. Kisaroua is initially sour, but her mood lightens toward characters who help prepare the ship, which requires a successful DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

Once the *Beden-Moon* is underway, its journey takes two hours. During this time, the sailors can share with the characters any of the details about Janya from the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section.

### Preparing to Descend

The *Beden-Moon*'s journey across the calm, shallow waters known as the Lightsea is uneventful. Eventually the water darkens as the ship crosses the edge of the continental shelf, entering the Nightsea. Gurau and Kisaroua furl the sails and drop a sea anchor at what Gurau calls the gateway to Janya, an area of glassy open water that Kisaroua identifies by careful compass and sun reckonings. Gurau offers to wait for the characters and hold on to any equipment the characters don't want to take underwater.

When the characters are ready to descend, Gurau explains what to expect.

- The descent to Janya is approximately 4,500 feet. This should take about 4 minutes for characters who have a swimming speed of 60 feet, or 15 minutes for those who don't have a swimming speed.  
- Word has been sent ahead to Xoese-Addae, an emissary of the High Court that rules Janya. He'll meet the characters when they arrive.  

Once Gurau has shared these details, Kisaroua has little patience for lingering. She gives the characters three [driftglobes](Mechanics/items/driftglobe.md) and encourages them to dive into the water. She pushes in characters who tarry.

### Beneath the Waves

Schools of silvery fish swarm around the characters as they descend through the first few hundred feet of the Nightsea. Life in the sunlight zone begins to thin as the water changes from vibrant blue-green to deeper blue. Once the characters descend 500 feet, only dim light illuminates their surroundings. After the characters descend 3,000 feet, they enter an area of complete darkness.

Unless characters are aided by magic, such as the cowrie shell necklaces from [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md), they can't swim for a full 8 hours per day. After each hour of swimming, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). A creature that has a swimming speed can swim all day without penalty and uses the normal "forced march rules" in the "Player's Handbook". The magic surrounding Janya protects visitors from being harmed or growing exhausted more swiftly because of the deep water's pressure and temperature.

Before proceeding with the following encounters, review the rules for "underwater combat" in the "Player's Handbook".

#### Death Helms a Ghost Ship

After the party descends approximately 3,000 feet, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score spots something unexpected:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The water begins to churn. From the darkness below glides a glowing, translucent longship, its oars bringing it just below you. A cloudiness covers the deck, swirling into forms vaguely resembling people. On the foredeck, a figure resolves from the cloudinessâ€”a transparent, rough-looking sailor in crusty scale mail, whose eyes blaze.
^3ec

The name *Girscamen* is plainly emblazoned on the ghost ship's hull. As the ship comes alongside the characters, the first mate (use the [wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) stat block) is joined by four crew members who are little more than eerie light and drifting skulls (they use the [flameskull](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) stat block). At first, it appears they are searching for somethingâ€”they're hunting for the haints that escaped them, Derek and Violette. Once they see the characters, however, the hostile Undead snarl challenges and attack.

Once the Undead are destroyed, the ghost ship breaks apart as if wrecked by a spectral storm and disappears.

## Arrival in Janya

As the characters near the seafloor, a pearlescent haze cuts through the darkness. Below they see a shimmering dome of light, a great magical barrier that shelters the city below. As the characters pass through, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A majestic vista spreads beneath the dome: the undersea city of Janya. The city's dark towers are carved with circular windows and covered with designs marked by bioluminescent barnacles. People slip through open corridors between buildings, swimming high above the volcanic rock and coral of the seafloor below.
^3ee

As the characters take in the beauty of the city, a figure approaches them.

![The shadows of aquatic res...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/117-12-004.undersea-janya.webp#center "The shadows of aquatic residents flit beneath the iridescent magic that protects the undersea city of Janya")

### Meeting Xoese-Addae

A figure with kelp-colored hair and stingray-colored skin approaches the characters, introducing himself as Xoese-Addae, an emissary of the High Court of Janya. Xoese-Addae is neutral good and one of the [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) (see below). He greets the characters warmly, saying his friend Gurau sent word of their coming, and asks what brings them to the city.

Once the characters relate their story, Xoese-Addae ponders a moment. If the characters mention the phantom ship they encountered on the way to Janya, he is particularly concerned. Many of the wreck sites dotting the seafloor around Janya are known to be haunted, but he's never heard of similar manifestations in open water.

Xoese-Addae notes that if anyone has heard of ghost ships or knows if the wreck of the *Girscamen* is charted, it's [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md), who commands Janya's security force. He offers to escort the characters to the Cerulean Lyceum, Janya's great bardic college, where [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) and the other members of the High Court are attending a gala.

If the characters want to explore Janya, Xoese-Addae can guide the characters around the city before taking them to the Cerulean Lyceum. Use the "Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer" section to guide explorations of Janya.

#### Nightsea Chil-liren

Xoese-Addae or any of Janya's other residents can tell the characters that the undersea city of Janya is populated by descendants of Djaynai who escaped into the sea during the Passage of Vultures. The magic of Djaynaian transmuters and that of the Nightsea itself gave these people the ability to live beneath the waves. Now known as [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md), the people of Janya look similar to the humans of Djaynai, but their brown skin is often tinged shades of gray, and eel-like fins run along their arms and legs.

[Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) use the [merfolk](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/merfolk.md) stat block with the following changes:

- They have [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.  
- Replace the Amphibious trait with the trait below.  

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Water Breathing.** [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) can breathe only underwater.
^3f1

### Gala at the Cerulean Lyceum

Xoese-Addae leads the characters to the Cerulean Lyceum, a series of vaulted, crystalline halls set around a broad quadrangle. When the characters arrive, the quad is filled with Janyans enraptured by the low-toned, hypnotic music of a group of bards.

Xoese-Addae leads the characters to a private audience suite overlooking the quad, occupied by a single Janyan wearing fine, billowing robesâ€”this is [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md).

![Zisatta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/118-12-005.zisatta.webp#center)

#### Zisatta

The aloof [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) is a member of the High Court and commands Janya's security forces, called the Billowing Patrol for their sable robes that undulate like jellyfish. She is lawful neutral and one of the [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) (see the "[Nightsea Chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md)" section). Tattoos of ancient Djaynaian symbols peak out from beneath her flowing robesâ€”signs of her fervent desire to prove her connection and dedication to Djaynai.

##### Personality Trait

"I have more important matters to attend to than you."

##### Ideal

"Tradition must be preserved at all costs."

##### Bond

"While Janya and Djaynai are separate nations, we must defend our Djaynaian kin."

##### Flaw

"I'm enraged by any suggestion that I am not Djaynaian."

#### What Zisatta Knows

[Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) rises without introducing herself and is initially indifferent to the characters. She acknowledges Xoese-Addae and imperiously asks why he and his surface-world friends have interrupted her enjoyment of the performance.

Use the following points to guide the initial conversation, but see "Unexpected Interruption" below if the characters get into the details of their mission:

- As soon as a character speaks, [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) interrupts and orders all the characters to introduce themselves rather than first sharing her own name.  
- If the characters speak about the ghost ship, [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) tensely reports that sightings of a ghostly vessel above Janya began several days ago.  
- [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) remembers the name *Girscamen* and says the Billowing Patrol knows the location of its wreckage.  

#### Unexpected Interruption

Before the characters can share all the details of their mission with [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md), the door to her suite bursts open, and a figure swims in: [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md), another member of the High Court.

[Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) announces he learned of a group of surface-world heroes coming to Janya through "friends among the Night Revelers." He saw the characters arrive while he was watching the performance and wants to learn if they have come to Janya on "mercenary business from the surface."

#### Brother Broumane

[Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) is one of the charismatic leaders of the New Janyan movement, a political group focused on Janya's self-reliance and future greatness. He secretly also heads the Untethered, a cult dedicated to chaotic philosophies. He's chaotic neutral and one of the [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) (see the "Nightsea Chil-liren" section). He wears robes made from a patchwork of rough-spun and fine white fabrics.

![Brother Broumane](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/119-12-006.brother-broumane.webp#center)

##### Personality Trait

"I want our culture to swim free from irrelevant traditions."

##### Ideal

"Janya is its own realm."

##### Bond

"We serve Janya by defining the future instead of dwelling on the past."

##### Flaw

"Cross me and you'll regret it more than you can imagine."

#### Caught in the Middle

Both [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) and [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) want to learn the scope of the characters' mission. They largely ignore each other as they each attempt to win the characters to their side. During the conversation, [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) focuses on the following points:

- [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) tries to discern whether the characters are working for the People's Stewards and is pleased if they are.  
- She tries to get the characters to admit their mission is connected to lost lore essential to the future of both Djaynai and Janya.  

At the same time, [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) focuses on the following points:

- [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) tries to find out if the characters are working for the Night Revelers and is pleased if they are.  
- He tries to get the characters to admit they're seeking the outdated lore of a foreign land.  
- He claims his faction has ways of learning everything the Billowing Patrol knows, and if there's information the characters need, he can provide it.  

The two High Court members eventually insist the characters choose who theyâ€”and, by extension, Djaynaiâ€”will align with. Xoese-Addae, a consummate politician, keeps his opinions to himself.

#### A Fraught Debate

It should be clear that the characters' mission puts them in the middle of a political and philosophical debate that stretches back generations. [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md)'s group, the Djaynaists, believe in cultivating the Janyan people's connection to their original homeland, Djaynai. [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md)'s group, the New Janyans, want Janyans to forge their own identity. The characters are unlikely to have strong opinions one way or the other but need to get information from one of the High Court members.

##### Choosing Sides

The easiest route to gaining the information the characters need is to declare support for one High Court member's philosophy. This earns the chosen person's favor, but the other leaves, insulted. While the insulted politician won't oppose the characters' mission, they take the characters' choice as indicative of all surface dwellers' stances, which might fray the relationship between the two civilizations.

##### Diplomacy

If the characters don't want to publicly align themselves with either faction, a character brings the debate to an end civilly by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. The characters can then reconvene with either High Court member in private. Alternatively, if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, they present a point that both court members agree to, winning the support of both.

#### Ending the Debate

Whichever High Council member the characters align with can get them directions to the *Girscamen*'s wreck with only a few hours of work. But they pass on their information only if the characters agree to a request.

##### What Zisatta Wants

In return for directions to the wreck of the Girscamen, [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md) wants the characters to bring her whatever lore they find so her people can learn more about their lost heritage. She asserts that it is her duty to share this cultural wisdom with the People's Stewards (and believes that doing so will validate the viewpoint of her faction). Through compelling roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can convince her to settle for making a copy of whatever they find before they return to Djaynaiâ€”a process that takes a week.

##### What Brother Broumane Wants

[Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) tells the characters the location of the Girscamen's wreck if they swear to return any lore they find to him so he can destroy it. When the party returns, a character can fool [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md) by claiming they found nothing and succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. If the characters return and give him something that looks like an ancient relic but isn't the lost Djaynaian lore, they can convince him it was all they found with a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check.

##### Destination in the Depths

Once the characters have reached an agreement with a High Court member, that person provides a map of the region around Janya with a location 15 miles from the city marked. This spot, known as the Trench of Love Lost, is where members of the Billowing Patrol found the wreck of the Girscamen.

Xoese-Addae is familiar with the region around Janya and is willing to escort the characters to the top of the trench. If the characters please, they can spend some time in Janya before seeking the *Girscamen*.

## Trench of Love Lost

The region around Janya is well guarded, but dangers still occasionally slip past the Billowing Patrol. Following Xoese-Addae, the trip to the Trench of Love Lost takes 2Â½ hours for characters who have a swimming speed (or 10 hours otherwise). Along the way, the characters might encounter a variety of deep-sea creatures, such as three [giant sharks](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-shark.md) feeding on the remains of deep sea whales. No spirits or ghost ships make an appearance, though.

As the characters near the trench, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Meadows of feathery, pale-pink sea lilies move slowly to and fro in the gentle current. The view is idyllic up to the trench's edge, which crumbles away to deeper depths.
^409

Xoese-Addae assures the characters that the shipwreck should be below. He agrees to wait for the characters at the top of the trench for a few hours but is eager to get back to the safety of Janya as soon as possible.

### Trench of Lost Love Features

The following features are common throughout the trench and the surrounding areas:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings of both the ship and ruins are 10 feet high.  
- **Darkness.** All areas are cast in complete darkness.  
- **Underwater.** All areas are fully submerged and airless.  

### Trench of Love Lost Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 12.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 12.2: Trench of Love Lost](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/120-map-12.2-trench-of-love-lost.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/121-map-12.2-trench-of-love-lost-player.webp#gallery)

#### T1: Trench

The trench is 200 feet deep. At the bottom is the wreck of the *Girscamen*. Read the following description as the characters come within sight of the wreck:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Midnight-colored coral covers the trench's sheer walls. As the bottom of the trench comes into view, you see the wreckage of an ancient, familiar-looking longship gripped by the spreading coral. Silt and debris cover the deck, but the name *Girscamen* is still visible on the hull.
^40d

Characters within 10 feet of the *Girscamen* feel a harmless supernatural chillâ€”an effect of the unquiet spirits haunting the ship. If characters succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, they can tell restless spirits dwell nearby.

#### T2: Wreck

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The *Girscamen* evidently broke in two when it sank. Half the ship is embedded in the trench wall and the coral around it; the rest was lost to the tides. A sizable hole pierces the deck and the hull below.
^40f

The first time a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead comes within 5 feet of the ship's wreckage, the creature must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (`6d6`) psychic damage and telepathically hears dozens of drowning cries.

Characters who inspect the hole in the ship determine it continues through the bottom of the vessel, and beyond that a hole punched through the bottom of the trench leads into area T3 20 feet below.

Any other search of the ship reveals nothing except for ancient, rusted chain mail and scraps of decaying armor not of Djaynaian design.

#### T3: Broken Entry

The hole below the ship extends through the ceiling of an ancient, hidden structure. Characters who have the Stonecunning trait can tell falling rocks punched through into the structure. The chambers below are made of interlocking, dark gray stones carved into puzzle-piece-like shapes.

#### T4: Obsidian Throne

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this chamber are inscribed with images of sea creatures and geometric patterns. At its center, a short platform bears a high-backed, obsidian throne sculpted with stylized images similar to those on the walls. Behind and to the sides of the platform are four deep, rounded alcoves.
> 
> A spectral, armored figure with blazing emerald eyes appears from behind the throne and advances. "More fools of Djaynai? I'm the captain of the *Girscamen*, and you will meet the same fate as all who set foot upon my vessel!"
^412

This hostile [wraith](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) wears armor similar to that of the wraiths the characters battled previously. It fights to the death.

##### Ancient Art

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check can tell the carved walls and throne are ancient and were perhaps made by the very first Janyans as a way to preserve sacred knowledge in a secure place. A [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of abjuration magic around the throne.

##### Lurking Aboleth

In the shadows of the southwest alcove lurks the [aboleth](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) Ylch. It doesn't interfere with the wraith's attack and won't initially threaten the characters. Once it is revealed, it telepathically invites the characters to talk. Use the following information to guide the conversation.

- Ylch recently discovered this ruin, created by ancient Janyan stewards of knowledge.  
- Ylch was attracted here by the aura of the Undead still suffering from the legacy of the Passage of Vultures.  
- In investigating the site, Ylch disrupted the unquiet spirits of the *Girscamen*. It has been using its magic to control the wraiths that arose from that terrible ship.  
- It wants to know what brought the characters here so it can better understand the value of the site and the magical relics it has discovered.  

If the characters reveal what they seek, Ylch realizes the value of the tomes in area T5. After this, or if the characters are hostile toward it, Ylch telepathically calls upon the lingering crew of the *Girscamen* to aid it and then attacks.

##### Sunken Souls

At the aboleth's call, three [flameskulls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md)â€”the remains of the hateful crew of the Girscamenâ€”come to the aboleth's defense via the passage to area T2. As the flameskulls enter the area, a familiar [haint](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haint-jttrc.md), Violette, appears in her incorporeal form and intercepts one of the flameskulls. Violette, now free from the crew of the Girscamen, is friendly toward the characters and keeps the flameskull she intercepted at bay. After 2 rounds she defeats that flameskull, then aids the characters against any remaining foes.

Once the aboleth is defeated, the remaining flameskulls flee to area T1 and then out of the trench. Violette offers a sincere nod to the characters, then joins Derek in area T5.

#### T5: Forgotten Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The ceiling is covered with a mosaic of wide-eyed figures swimming through a sea teeming with life. Below, the walls are lined with strange, rusted weapons and the stone shelves of a library.
^417

Soon after the characters enter the room, the friendly [haint](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/haint-jttrc.md) Derek appearsâ€”he's joined by Violette if the battle in area T4 occurred. Derek and Violette have been protecting the books hidden in this chamber. Upon recognizing the characters, Derek thanks them for coming to recover the tomes he and Violette have been guarding for so long. Derek then directs the characters' attention to a shadowy shelf where rest two elegant tomes made from iron-bound pages of carved slate. These books bear the symbols the characters saw after the haunting at Anadoua's Rest House and are the *Book of the Blackthrone's Aegis* and the *Book of the Blackmist*.

##### Treasure

The weapons along the walls are rusted and made for creatures with non-Humanoid anatomies. However, two magic items inscribed with Djaynaian symbols are usable and remain intact: a [sun blade](Mechanics/items/sun-blade.md) and a [staff of frost](Mechanics/items/staff-of-frost.md).

### Legacy of the Lost

Once the aboleth is defeated and the writings in area T5 are recovered, the spirits of Derek and Violette appear before the characters in their lifelike forms. They thank the group for defeating the aboleth and ask the characters to return the tomes to their rightful owners, the people of Djaynai. They don't elaborate on what group that might mean and know nothing of Janya. If the characters agree to return the tomes, the two haints invite the characters to bow deeply to the throne in area T4 to honor the ancestors who once sat upon it. If the characters do so, the lingering spirits reward the party (see "Gifts of the Deep" below). Should one or more of the characters refuse, Derek and Violette quietly fade away.

#### Gift of the Deeps

After the characters agree to return the tomes, the throne in area T5 starts shedding dim light. Each character who bows before the obsidian throne for the first time gains the charm below (a type of "supernatural gift" detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Once all the characters bow before the throne or 10 minutes pass, the light fades and the throne loses its magical properties.

##### Seasoul Touched

Inspired by teachings in the Blackmist Way and Blackthrone Arts that ease the distinction between body and soul, this charm allows you to cast the [gaseous form](Mechanics/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell as an action, with no spell components required. Once used three times, the charm goes away.

## Conclusion

Once the characters finish exploring, where they go next is up to them. Xoese-Addae is eager to take them back to Janya or can be convinced to escort them to the surface where they left the *Beden-Moon*. The journey back to Djaynai is uneventful.

How the adventure concludes depends on who the characters return the tomes to.

- If the characters bring the tomes to [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md), he is overjoyed, declaring the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts will be a boon to Djaynai's people and help protect its shores. The People's Stewards hold a solemn ceremony of honor in Castle Djaynai followed by festivities that spill onto the streets.  
- If the characters bring the books to [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md), the Night Reveler leader speaks ecstatically of how they will remake the old ways into new arts, and how any foes will be awed and want to emulate the people of Djaynai and their revels.  
- If the characters take the books to [Zisatta](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zisatta-jttrc.md), she holds onto the books for further study, seeking to understand them comprehensively before returning them to Djaynai.  
- If the characters deliver the books to [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md), he scans the books for knowledge he believes the Untethered can improve upon before he destroys them.  
- If the characters admit to leaving the tomes in Janya or, worse, destroying them at the behest of [Brother Broumane](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/brother-broumane-jttrc.md), [Atiba-Pa](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atiba-pa-jttrc.md) is mournful while [Djeneba](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/djeneba-jttrc.md) is philosophical.  

No matter the fate of the books of lore, the characters are celebrated by some and vilified by others, but they have an opportunity to serve in the future of Djaynai. They might be offered permanent positions of service to the People's Stewards or ritually inducted as members of the Night Revelers. Additionally, friction between Djaynai and Janya might arise if the characters followed the will of one city at the expense of the other.

In any case, many in both Djaynai and Janya come to wonder what other powerful Djaynaian wisdom might rest in the deep, waiting to be rediscovered.

## Djaynai and Janya Gazetteer

Modern Djaynai is a coastal realm descended from a grand civilization. Though the nation has never been defeated by external forces, its fortunes were greatly diminished hundreds of years ago after raiders perpetrated atrocities upon the land and its people in a series of attacks known as the Passage of Vultures. Djaynai's defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the Lightsea Lancers, who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid Djaynai and its neighbors.

During the Passage of Vultures, countless captured Djaynaians leaped from the ships of the marauders, like raindrops falling into the sea. "Freedom now!" they shouted as they sought the ocean's embrace. In the midnight depths, those ancient Djaynaians called upon their magic and that of the Nightsea, and they were transformed into beings dubbed [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md), gifted with the ability to live in the deep. Over centuries, they became the civilization known as Janya.

Modern Janya is a majestic, deep-sea city protected by magical wards that resemble an opalescent aurora with the sheen of a blue-black pearl. Its buildings are castle-like structures resembling those of Djaynai above, but made from magically hardened, obsidian-hued silt and studded by crystalline support beams jutting from the smooth walls.

### Djaynai and Janya Features

Those familiar with Djaynai and Janya typically know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** These lands are known for their ancestral legacies, political schisms, and transformed cultures.  
- **Djaynai's People.** Djaynai's folk are mostly human and have tightly curled hair, which is worn in a variety of natural and ornate styles. Their lustrous skin tones range from warm ebony and mahogany to the coppery glow of the setting sun. Gnomes, dragonborn, and other Humanoid folk are common and accepted in Djaynai.  
- **Djaynai's Languages.** The people of Djaynai speak Djaynaian, Common, and occasionally Aquan.  
- **Janya's People.** Janyans are an amphibious people of Djaynaian descent called [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) (see the "Nightsea Chil-liren" section earlier in this adventure). They typically resemble lithe humans with sharp teeth and ribbon-like fins along their appendages. Their skin tones are usually desaturated shades of gray-brown.  
- **Janya's Languages.** The people of Janya speak an archaic form of Djaynaian that allows easy if slow communication with people who speak the modern tongue, as well as Common and Aquan.  

### Noteworthy Sites

Djaynai is a peaceful land dominated by mangrove forests along the southern coast and jagged cliffs to the north. Its calm coastal waters are known as the Lightsea, but beyond a continental shelf the waters grow suddenly deeper. This is the Nightsea, the shadowy depths that hold the vibrant city of Janya.

#### Castle Djaynai

Castle Djaynai is made from onyx-colored mud brick studded with wooden pilasters and features a roof of sharp pinnacles. It is home to the rotating representative government called the People's Stewards, and its chambers hold ornate rugs and tapestries, the fragrance of essential oils, and performances of hypnotic music, which combine to create a warm welcome for invited guests. To deter intruders, the castle is lined with magical traps that polymorph victims into the saltwater salamanders (use the [lizard](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/lizard.md) stat block) common among Djaynai's mangroves.

#### Ancestors' Danse House

Home to the spiritual faction known as the Night Revelers, the Ancestors' Danse House in Djaynai is a mausoleum with smooth, chalky-white, mud-brick walls. Its library contains numerous scrolls of magical lore, and thousands of ancestors' bones in ossuaries throughout the site are enchanted to magically rise as [skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) and defend against would-be-thieves.

#### Trench of Love Lost

This great undersea trench near Janya resonates with mystery and foreboding. It is named in memory of the countless Djaynaians who vanished into its depths during the earliest days of the Passage of Vultures, before the first [Nightsea chil-liren](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/nightsea-chil-liren-jttrc.md) came to be. The trench is defined by the pale-pink meadows of feathery creatures known as sea lilies that grow along its edges. Scouts of Janya's Billowing Patrol have explored only a small fraction of the trench, which contains the wrecks of numerous ships and mysterious sites.

#### Cerulean Lyceum

A center of culture in Janya, the Cerulean Lyceum is a great bardic college with a connected series of vaulted halls set around a broad quadrangle. Icicle-like spikes surround the Cerulean Lyceum's main conservatory, which resembles a massive blue crystal. Djaynju, opera from Djaynai, is just one of the many musical forms practiced and perfected here.

### Life in Djaynai and Janya

The following truths are known to people who dwell in Djaynai or Janya, and to travelers who spend time in those realms. Those above and below the sea share similar cultures and values, though Janya's aquatic environment drives some differences.

#### Education and Religion

Both realms' culture is tightly tied to Djaynai's historical roots as an advanced, influential civilization. Education and creativity are the foundations of the culture, and its people embrace philosophy, magic, mathematics, and the study of underwater societies. In keeping with these traditions, spirituality isn't focused on gods, but on revering and emulating forces such as liberation, fluidity, and change. As such, most people are open to the spiritual views of others, as long as those views don't embrace evil.

#### Food and Clothing

Meals are considered sacred in Djaynai, and wasting food is a major breach of etiquette. Key ingredients of Djaynai's cuisine include banana, groundnut, milk from several types of animals, red and black beans, and chili peppers. In Janya, edible undersea plants form the bulk of people's diet, supplemented by ingredients imported from Djaynai. As a rule, both peoples eschew eating meat.

Djaynaian clothing combines rough-spun and delicate materials, and it is common to see linen with lace or damask with crocheted fabrics in the same outfit. Most Djaynaians wear a form of shawl or cloak at all times, and their fashion favors muted colors. Headwear is typically worn in public, most commonly cowls with pointed caps, wide-brimmed hats, or tagelmusts and tasuwarts that can function as headgear and veil. Clothing in Janya parallels Djaynaian style but features materials like eel skin and elegantly woven sea grasses.

#### Government in Djaynai

The government of Djaynai is called the People's Stewards, whose leadership ranks change whenever a significant number of citizens publicly call for new elections. All citizens of Djaynai are simultaneously seen as nobles, workers, and potential Stewards. The anarchic spiritual group called the Night Revelers poses a challenge to the Stewards' authority, arguing that Djaynai must abandon all government to truly be free.

The security forces that protect Djaynaiâ€”including the scouts known as Lightsea Lancersâ€”are highly effective in their roles, but Djaynaian law emphasizes redemption over punishment. In the direst criminal cases, controversial rituals are performed to prevent the offender from acting on their wicked impulses. The offender is then banished for life.

#### Government in Janya

Janya is an oligarchy ruled by a group called the High Court, some members of which are able to contact key leaders in Djaynai on rare occasions through magical means. Members of the High Courtâ€”and the many agents and liaisons who serve itâ€”work in the city's magnificent Council Chamber, which is housed within the shell of a gigantic whelk. However, friction between the Djaynaist and New Janyan factions of the High Court can turn meetings into fraught debates.

The security forces of Janya are called the Billowing Patrol, named for their flowing, dark robes. Their headquarters is a looming silvery fortress guarded by imposing sentries in armor bristling with spikes.

#### Music

Traditional music in both realms functions to spiritually transfigure listeners. It emphasizes low tones and syncopated rhythms, utilizing stringed instruments such as the [lute](Mechanics/items/lute.md)-like guembri, akoting, and xalam; the musical bow known as the berimbau; and the sonorous atabaque [drum](Mechanics/items/drum.md).

#### Names

Djaynaians and Janyans use only single names publicly, reserving family names for close loved ones. In both realms, those family names combine Djaynaian words focused on nature, such as Pineshadow or Misthare. The following are common public names:

- **Feminine.** Chainay, Fantou, ImanÃ©, Kadidia, Khonjit, Lashall  
- **Masculine.** Adesola, Alphiadou, Bacar, D'arael, Darweshi, Mayn  
- **Gender-Neutral.** Akkia, Evlyn, Jayvyn, Kellar, KionÃ©, Lakarai  

### Legends of Djaynai and Janya

Djaynai has been a beacon of independence and knowledge for millennia. Indeed, Djaynai has ultimately prevailed over all invaders, with a key role played by the mystical practices known as the Blackmist Way and Blackthrone Arts. Unfortunately, Djaynai's friendly neighboring realms are more often threatened. For instance, inscrutable lizardfolk in the wetlands periodically congregate and cause havoc in the nearby ocean. The Lightsea Lancersâ€”who take their name from the shallow coastal waters Djaynaians call the Lightseaâ€”was formed to monitor such threats before they impact Djaynai. Travelers occasionally come to Djaynai to learn the Lightsea Lancers' ways, as their heroics, dance-like martial arts, and knowledge of transmutation magic are renowned throughout Djaynai and beyond.

Beneath the Nightsea, the realm of Janya has its own tales. Many tell of how early Janyans were focused not only on rebuilding their lives but on preserving what they treasured from the land above. To keep such lore safe, ancestral Janyans built structures in hidden reaches, like the Trench of Love Lost, to archive sacred wisdom before it was lost. Eventually, though, such archives faded from memory. Profound Djaynaian secrets remain hidden in the deep, awaiting rekindling.

### Characters from Djaynai

If players create characters from Djaynai or with ties to Janya, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**How do you feel about the Will of the Insurgent Tides**? Do you support the quest to recover the lore of the Blackmist Way and the Blackthrone Arts, or are they relics of an unrecoverable past?

**Do you or anyone in your family have a connection to the Night Revelers**? Do you embrace that faction's call to anarchy, or do you seek to undermine that call before it spreads further?

**Whether you come from Djaynai or Janya, how much do you know of the other realm**? Do you consider yourself a person of two worlds? Or do you yearn for a greater understanding of your kin on the other side of the water's surface?

## Haint

Rising from the sorrowful dead, haints are spirits that change their shape in tragic imitation of what they once were. A haint can shift from its spectral form to appear as the corporeal Humanoid it was in life, passing as a living creature. These spirits might mistakenly view innocents as those who killed them or entreat mortals to exact revenge on their behalf.
