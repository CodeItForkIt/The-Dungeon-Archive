# The Radiant Citadel
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 6* 

*Gathering Place of Strangers and Stories*

Against the unending mist and unseen terrors of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel stands bright as a bastion of hope. It's a living relic of the ingenuity and collaboration of twenty-seven great civilizations. Abandoned and lost for ages, the Citadel was resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by descendants of those societies, though some peoples remain missing. The city serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life.

The Radiant Citadel is a miracle of architecture, a floating city carved out of a single, massive fossil that snakes around a colossal gemstone shard known as the Auroral Diamond. The luminescence of the Auroral Diamond is mirrored in the constellation of fifteen structure-sized gemstones, the Concord Jewels, which orbit the city and provide transportation to the far-flung homes of the Citadel's founding civilizations. In the haze of the Ethereal Plane, the Auroral Diamond is a scintillating beacon visible from leagues away. The diamond itself seems to have moods, changing colors unpredictably, but it is always visible for wanderers lost and in need. Just beyond the city whirls a massive, ever-threatening, ethereal cyclone known as the Keening Gloom—a looming threat that's a grim reminder of the Citadel's precarious position.

Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in the Radiant Citadel. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid.

## Features

Those familiar with the Radiant Citadel know the following details:

- **Hallmarks.** The Radiant Citadel is an extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty. Local traditions of oral storytelling preserve ancestral wisdom from many worlds.  
- **People of the Radiant Citadel.** The majority of the Radiant Citadel's populace comes from the civilizations that govern the city. This makes the population an ethnically diverse mix of humans, dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, along with a variety of other races.  
- **Languages.** Common is widely known, along with dozens of other languages.  

## Noteworthy Sites

The Radiant Citadel is a testament to a lost age of extraordinary magic and mythical beasts. The city rises from a gargantuan fossil, and every road and building has been carved from it. The Citadel is a place of beauty and wonder, with a vast array of vegetation and a multitude of sites and inhabitants.

### Auroral Diamond

The Auroral Diamond is the heart of the Radiant Citadel. A massive gemstone of unfathomable power, its life-giving magic runs through the entire city; the city's vegetation, water, light, and unique artifices depend on the Diamond.

The Auroral Diamond changes color for unknown reasons. Sometimes it holds a color for an entire year, while other times it shifts twice in a single week. Rarely does it ever repeat a color. Some scholars believe each color represents the birth of a new civilization somewhere in the multiverse, and repetition of a color means the death of that civilization. Other scholars hypothesize the changing colors are a countdown to some unknown event.

The Auroral Diamond is indestructible. Whatever magic hollowed out the gemstone's center and created the Preserve of the Ancestors (described later) is unknown.

### Court of Whispers

The denizens of the Court of Whispers barter for current knowledge. Heralds, criers, bards, and griots buy and sell information from the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, as well as other lands. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term reconnaissance or long-term infiltration. The Court is a mixed outdoor-indoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas, and plentiful work is available here for talented adventurers.

The Speakers for the Ancestors—the leaders of the Radiant Citadel—employ freelancers from the Court of Whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people's homelands, as well as potential threats to the Citadel, while the Shieldbearers of the Citadel (see the "Palace of Exile" section) seek information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Even common citizens might hire folk from the Court to find missing loved ones, locate lost family treasures, or gather information on rivals.

Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. Noteworthy examples include the Harpers of Abeir-Toril, Sigil's Fraternity of Order, and agents of the planes-traveling gnome fixer Vi.

### House of Convalescence

The House of Convalescence focuses the life-giving energies of the Auroral Diamond, allowing for incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It also draws clerics and healers of many traditions. Most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself.

Magic is affected in the following ways in the House of Convalescence:

- **Diamond Components.** When the spells [raise dead](Mechanics/spells/raise-dead.md), [resurrection](Mechanics/spells/resurrection.md), [revivify](Mechanics/spells/revivify.md), or [true resurrection](Mechanics/spells/true-resurrection.md) are cast in the House of Convalescence, a diamond material component is never required.  
- **Hit Point Maximum.** When creatures would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, they instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring `2d6` hit points to a creature, a spellcaster restores 12.  

### The Keening Gloom

Just beyond the light of the Radiant Citadel rages the Keening Gloom, a massive ethereal cyclone. Nothing that enters the cyclone is seen again.

When explorers rediscovered the Citadel, the Keening Gloom hungrily circled the city. Its endless howl struck terror in their hearts and engulfed several adventurers. After the heroes entered the Citadel and reawakened its power, the cyclone was driven back. But in times of turmoil within the Citadel, the cyclone ominously draws closer.

Scholars have studied the Keening Gloom for decades but have only theories about its nature, its connection to the Radiant Citadel, and what befalls those caught in its terrible throes. Many fear the cyclone cannot be held at bay forever.

### Palace of Exile

The adventurers who discovered and reoccupied the Radiant Citadel were from the civilizations that founded the city long ago. Among them, several had been set on the path of adventure after conflict or disaster drove them from their homes, and the Citadel provided solace. In turn, they established the Palace of Exile to help others in need.

The palace was named in honor of Socorro the Exile, its founding leader. He was a refugee of war in the land of San Citlán, and he selected one of the most beautiful complexes in the Citadel to house the needy as they arrived. He swore that while his homeland was occupied, he would be an exile and would make his home in the Palace, alongside any others with nowhere else to go.

The Palace of Exile has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in the Radiant Citadel permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palace's staff coordinate with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded.

The Shieldbearers, the Radiant Citadel's dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. Where there is a need, the Shieldbearers help.

### Preserve of the Ancestors

The Preserve of the Ancestors is a sprawling, domed wilderness cut into the heart of the Auroral Diamond. Lush vegetation grows directly out of the diamond, and the expanse is dotted with jackalberry trees, whistling thorn, and zebrawood. Insects, small birds, and the occasional hare make their home here. In the center of the Preserve is a circular, in-ground amphitheater that serves as the meeting place of the Citadel's ruling council, the Speakers for the Ancestors.

While the Preserve has little indigenous wildlife—mostly birds and small mammals—a sect of druids frequently brings injured animals here to be healed and rehabilitated. The Preserve is where the druids keep animals that can no longer survive in their native habitats, creating a menagerie of rare creatures from across many worlds.

Drawn by the power of the Auroral Diamond, spirits from countless lands make their home in the Preserve. Spirits from the same lands or of similar origins inhabit tiny jewels and assemble into amalgamations known as Incarnates. Some are small collections of spirits, but the greatest—related to the citadel's founding civilizations—are larger-than-life beings that embody the wisdom of ages (see the "Incarnates" section for details).

### Trade Discal

Encircling the Auroral Diamond, the Trade Discal is a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. It serves the needs of cities and nations or major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as entire herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported via the Concord Jewels (described below) to the Trade Discal quickly and safely.

The Trade Discal is a vital outlet; if something were to happen to it, the impact would be severe for both the Radiant Citadel and the civilizations that depend on it. Adventurers are sometimes hired to oversee the transport of commodities to and from the Citadel or to negotiate on behalf of a major trading company or government. Normally this is a smooth process, but when large amounts of gold are involved, trade is never risk free.

## Concord Jewels

![The Radiant Citadel, Which...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/003-01-002.drifting-citadel.webp#center "The Radiant Citadel, Which drifts through the depths of the Deep Ethereal, is a beacon of possibility and adventure")

Beyond the Radiant Citadel drift the Concord Jewels, which connect the city to its founding civilizations. Each Jewel is a building-sized vessel capable of holding hundreds of people and tons of goods. Though the Jewels take a variety of shapes, their interiors are similar. A cylindrical core holds containers for goods, including livestock. Surrounding the core is seating for passengers. The Citadel employs official operators called Clavigers to pilot the Jewels.

Each Concord Jewel is linked to one of the civilizations that founded the Radiant Citadel. A Jewel unerringly travels between the Radiant Citadel and the homeland of the Jewel's linked people. Even if the Jewel's people have migrated to another world on the Material Plane, the Jewel finds its way to their current home. While not in use, the Concord Jewels orbit the Radiant Citadel in an incandescent constellation. Each Jewel corresponds to one of the founding civilizations and resembles a giant gemstone of the type noted for that civilization on the Concord Jewels table. Missing civilizations and their Jewels are not listed and can be detailed as you please.

### Controlling a Concord Jewel

At a Concord Jewel's center are controls for the structure. A creature adjacent to these controls that spends a minute manipulating them can make a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. On a success, the creature can direct the Concord Jewel to take one of the following actions:

- **Land.** When commanded to land, the Jewel automatically settles into a safe position adjoining the Radiant Citadel or on the surface of a Material Plane world. From this site, creatures can move back and forth between the Jewel and the location. Sections of the exterior walls of the lowest 15 feet of the Jewel then become immaterial and semitransparent, allowing passage into and out of the Jewel.  
- **Embark.** A Jewel that has landed moves away from a location. If the Jewel is near the Radiant Citadel, it moves into the open Ethereal Plane and orbits the city. Otherwise, it rises 600 feet off the ground and hovers. A Jewel flies at a rate of 50 feet per round.  
- **Plane Shift.** The Jewel and everything on it shifts between planes. When it does so, it teleports either to the Deep Ethereal several thousand feet away from the Radiant Citadel or to a specific site on the Material Plane in the land the Jewel is linked to. When a Jewel teleports to its linked land, it appears 600 feet above a site where it can land and hovers there. The location where a Jewel arrives is noted in the "Setting the Adventure" section of each of this book's adventures.  

### Clavigers

Clavigers oversee the Concord Jewels. Each Speaker for the Ancestors chooses the Clavigers for the Jewel linked to that Speaker's civilization. A dozen Clavigers are assigned to each Concord Jewel, and at least two keep watch from each Jewel as it orbits the Radiant Citadel and guide it during its travels. Clavigers not only maintain transit and trade to and from the Radiant Citadel but also serve as ambassadors from the city to the founding civilizations. Many Clavigers go on to become Speakers for the Ancestors.

## Life in the Citadel

The Radiant Citadel is a city of immigrants. Several of the explorers who reclaimed the Citadel were refugees who escaped hardships that plagued their lands. They chose the Citadel as their home, despite its strangeness and the surreal surroundings of the Deep Ethereal, as it presented an opportunity to start anew. Most of the city's current inhabitants are descendants of the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, but all are welcome.

Some find living in the Deep Ethereal too disquieting to stay or chafe at the confines of the Citadel. Others depart out of fear that the Keening Gloom will destroy the Citadel. Their numbers are replenished by new arrivals who seek a different life, want to study the city's lore, or find solace in the city's peace and safety. The Citadel's society is shaped by this ebb and flow. Traditions, customs, and values are a mix of old and new; while some adhere to rituals no longer followed in their homeland, others create their own novel practices.

### Art and Culture

The Radiant Citadel's diaspora communities constantly learn and borrow from one another, creating a culture unique to the city. This evolution is displayed in the art, the clothing, the music, and—perhaps mostly vividly—the food of the city. While cantinas, tea houses, and eateries serve food and drink from specific communities, the most popular cuisines are fusion dishes like couscous infused with habanero and saffron, panela-coated fried yams, and kimchi tacos.

### Diplomacy

Relationships between the Radiant Citadel and the founding civilizations are often shifting. The Citadel sends diplomats abroad and houses embassies from foreign governments, but this goodwill is not always reciprocated. The Citadel's uniqueness makes it a target of foreign actors who seek to exert subtle or overt control over it. At the same time, political activists, dissidents, and revolutionaries seek to exploit the city's neutrality to their advantage, even staging incursions against their home governments from the relative safety of the Citadel.

### Governance and Politics

![The Obsidian Eagle, Dawn Incarnate of Tletepec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/004-01-003.obsidian-eagle.webp#center)

The Radiant Citadel is governed by a council known as the Speakers for the Ancestors. Each Speaker is a descendant of one of the founding civilizations currently known to the Citadel. They are chosen by their community and affirmed into office by the wise and ancient Dawn Incarnates. The Speakers for the Ancestors meet openly in the amphitheater in the center of the Preserve, and Citadel residents often watch their debates. All laws and major decisions of the city are decided by majority vote of the Speakers. Debates can become heated; because each Speaker represents very different constituents, consensus and compromises might take days or even months to reach. Those citizens of mixed ancestry or unconnected to the founding civilizations can choose a Speaker for the Ancestors to represent them. They register with the Speaker's office, and from then on, participate in future elections for that Speaker.

Governance is public, transparent, and participatory. Laws are not static but evolve to meet new challenges and needs. Subcouncils and committees manage the city under the guidance of the Speakers. Complexities persist in governing a highly diverse city with varied customs, beliefs, and social norms, but robust civic engagement helps the city overcome adversity.

### Law Enforcement and Justice

Public safety and peacekeeping are administered through a variety of councils and organizations designed to address specific issues. The House of Convalescence helps those living with mental illness, while inspectors investigate nonviolent crimes and use nonlethal methods of detainment. Theft is uncommon in the city, and rehabilitation and restorative justice are preferred methods of addressing wrongs. Highly trained local guards mobilize to handle the rare incidents of violence, and citizens are expected to proactively intervene if needed. The worst offenders are sentenced to a controversial Djaynaian punishment wherein the criminal is subjected to a ritual that prevents them from repeating their crime and then is banished from the city.

### Lifestyle and Society

Denizens of the Radiant Citadel strive to sustain an egalitarian society. Every citizen is entitled to a basic income that affords them the necessities of living and dignity in lifestyle. Food, water, and green spaces are equally accessible throughout the city. The House of Convalescence turns no one away; healing is priced according to one's means, and the poorest are served without charge. All housing is public, distributed, and administered through the city's councils.

Since the city's resources are limited due to the Citadel's relatively small area and its strange nature, foodstuffs and other materials are carefully conserved, and goods are reused or recycled when possible. Similarly, most food is vegetarian and is grown in green spaces throughout the city. Whether served in a home or an eatery, most animal products must be imported and so are subject to high tariffs.

### Tariffs and Taxation

Taxes are progressive to help reduce the gap between the most affluent and the poorest. High tariffs on imports keep the public coffers full, but the Speakers lower or remove tariffs for civilizations in trouble. Similarly, visitors to the Radiant Citadel pay a toll to enter. Those who come with nothing except good will pay no fee. Those with big pockets and big hearts give more according to their conscience rather than risk the rebuke of the city's guards. Rich and poor alike can instead offer something unique that might be to the liking of the Incarnates, such as a lost song, a secret tale, or a rare piece of art. Those who choose this option may present their gift to the Dawn Incarnate of their choice. If their toll is accepted, the visitor is allowed to stay in the Citadel.

## Groups of the Citadel

Several groups hold influence within the Radiant Citadel, guiding and protecting the city's peoples.

![In the Preserve of the Anc...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/005-01-004.amethyst-tiger.webp#center "In the Preserve of the Ancestors, a traveler seeks the wisdom of the Amethyst Tiger, Dawn Incarnate of Yeonido")

### Incarnates

The keepers of vast wisdom from distant lands, the Incarnates are collections of spirits bound within gemstones. Each of an Incarnate's component gemstones holds a spirit from the same land on the Material Plane. These might be nature spirits from a particular place or the spirits of individuals who once dwelled there. Upon forming, an Incarnate manifests a unique personality and identity, a gestalt of its constituents and their shared background. The greater the number of spirits that make up an Incarnate, the broader and deeper both its personality and its knowledge are.

Most Incarnates are small, no more than a handful of gems in the shape of a plant or animal. The least of them originate from spirits lost on the Ethereal Plane and are tiny collections of wayward spirits of similar origins with nowhere else to go. The largest and most influential are those of the fifteen founding civilizations collectively known as the Dawn Incarnates. Spanning more than a dozen feet in height, these Incarnates are composed of thousands of smaller gems of the same type. Each holds court in a portion of the Preserve, such as the Amethyst Tiger's knoll or the Obsidian Eagle's aerie.

The Dawn Incarnates have existed since the creation of the Radiant Citadel. While the Citadel's creators left behind no texts, it's believed that their collective wisdom is held by the Dawn Incarnates.

The Dawn Incarnates know everything that transpires in the Preserve of the Ancestors, which is why they require the Speakers for the Ancestors to meet there. While they do not interfere in the day-to-day administration of the city, they hold the Speakers responsible to the duties of their office. While a Dawn Incarnate has never removed a Speaker for the Ancestors (see "Speakers for the Ancestors" below), it is believed they could do so if displeased.

#### Identities of the Incarnates

Each Incarnate has a unique, amalgamated personality. Most who interact with an Incarnate interact with this primary identity. However, an Incarnate's primary personality is not a repository of its constituent spirits' knowledge; these spirits have their own thoughts and personalities. While an Incarnate broadly knows what its spirits know, a wealth of information is locked inside them. A constituent spirit within an Incarnate might be awakened by evoking the spirit's name or presenting something of significance to that spirit. Once a spirit is awakened, it takes over as the dominant personality of the Incarnate for a matter of minutes and might share its specific memories.

A spirit knows only what it has observed. A nature spirit that inhabited a small pond might know a great deal about the fisher who visited its banks every week for fifty years, but might not know that person's name or where they lived. An ancestor spirit might know the intimate details of their family and town, but nothing about their neighbor's great-grandchildren. Each spirit is a single window into the civilization; together, an Incarnate's spirits have a wide but not infallible perspective on the history of their people.

![The Amber Scorpion, Dawn I...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/006-01-005.amber-scorpion.webp#center "The Amber Scorpion, Dawn Incarnate of the Sensa Empire")

#### Audiences with Incarnates

An Incarnate and its constituent spirits are not malicious or duplicitous, but they do not necessarily answer questions easily or without a price. Some require the completion of a quest, while others might give a puzzle to solve. Some speak plainly; others respond in poem or parable. And some refuse to speak at all.

#### Dawn Incarnates of the Preserve

Each Dawn Incarnate that inhabits the Preserve of the Ancestors is related to a founding civilization active in the Citadel, as detailed on the Dawn Incarnates table.

**Dawn Incarnates**

| Civilization | Dawn Incarnate |
|--------------|----------------|
| Akharin Sangar | Turquoise Lion |
| Atagua | Yellow Quartz Kapok Tree |
| Dayawlongon | Serpentine Banyan Tree |
| Djaynai | Water Opal Saltwater Salamander |
| Godsbreath | Jasper Pecan Tree |
| San Citlán | Fire Opal Xoloitzcuintle |
| Sensa | Amber Scorpion |
| Shankhabhumi | Moonstone Water Lily |
| Siabsungkoh | Ruby Pangolin |
| Tayyib | Sard Elephant |
| Tletepec | Obsidian Eagle |
| Umizu | Pearl Carp |
| Yeonido | Amethyst Tiger |
| Yongjing | White Jade Flowering Pear Tree |
| Zinda | Bastite Caiman |
^dawn-incarnates

A grim anomaly, a dead Dawn Incarnate known as the Sapphire Wyvern, disturbs the tranquility of the Preserve of the Ancestors. It lies inert, its gemstones blackened and cracked. Scholars believe it was the Dawn Incarnate of one of the Radiant Citadel's twelve lost civilizations, but all efforts to awaken it have failed. What happened to it and the eleven absent Dawn Incarnates of the other founding civilizations, none know.

### Speakers for the Ancestors

The Speakers for the Ancestors are the ruling body of the Radiant Citadel. Candidates are chosen through an election among the diaspora of the people they represent. Once a candidate has been elected, they must face the fifteen founding Dawn Incarnates and pass their tests. Some Dawn Incarnates question the candidate until they are satisfied, while others send the candidate on a quest. These trials ensure Speakers understand each of the founding civilizations of the Radiant Citadel.

Once a Speaker for the Ancestors is chosen, they hold office for ten years. At the end of their tenure, they can step down; if they don't, they must face the same selection process again. There is no assurance a Speaker will be reelected, or if they are, that the Dawn Incarnates will approve them again.

As founding civilizations are rediscovered and rejoin the Radiant Citadel, the council is expanded, and the new Speakers gain power equal to that of their peers.

#### A Speaker's Role

The Speakers for the Ancestors face incredible challenges in their role. They must maintain the internal stability of a large and diverse city and ensure its people are treated equally and fairly under the law. Simultaneously, they manage a complex relationship with the founding civilizations. The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise. However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.

While decisions by the Speakers are made by simple majority, each Speaker has a very powerful veto that prevents them from being marginalized by political alliances.

#### Power of the Speakers

While in the Radiant Citadel, each Speaker rightfully chosen by the Radiant Citadel's people and the Dawn Incarnates can take an action to exert control over the Concord Jewels in the following ways:

- They can deactivate all Concord Jewels that are in orbit around the Radiant Citadel, preventing the Jewels' controls from functioning and rendering the vessels stranded.  
- The Speaker who deactivated the Concord Jewels can reactivate the Jewels. (The rightful successor of a Speaker who deactivated the Concord Jewels can also take this action.)  

Since every Speaker has the ability to paralyze trade and major transit to the city, they are forced to find diplomatic resolutions to disagreements. Though the use or threat of a veto might prompt furious debates and intense rivalries, eventually the Speakers for the Ancestors find solutions.

#### Bound to the Citadel

Once a Speaker no longer holds office, they lose the powers related to their position. If a Speaker steps down before the end of their term or dies while in office, all basic necessities in the Radiant Citadel gradually cease to function. Unless a suitable replacement for that Speaker is elected and approved by the Dawn Incarnates within thirty days, plants in the Radiant Citadel stop growing, wells run dry, and lighting ceases to function. Similarly, a Speaker cannot leave the Radiant Citadel for more than thirty days before the city's basic utilities begin to fail.

Speakers for the Ancestors are often celebrated heroes capable of handling most danger that comes their way, yet they are so vital to the integrity of the Radiant Citadel that each is carefully protected, both magically and by contingents of guards.

#### Sholeh

[Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md) is a legendary figure in the history of the Citadel. Having led the successful effort to rediscover the Radiant Citadel, she was the first Speaker for the Ancestors and is the only originator of that position to still hold the office. This is, at least in part, because she is a famed [ancient brass dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/ancient-brass-dragon.md) of Akharin Sangar. Unlike many of her kind, she is neutral good and a pragmatic, shrewd leader. For two hundred and fifty years, she has been a consummate councilor and has deftly managed the complex politics of the city. She hopes to find the missing twelve founding civilizations and believes the fate of the Citadel depends on it.

Known affectionately (or derisively) as the Old Lady, she often takes the form of an older, brown-skinned human woman. Quick to anger and quicker to love, she has rivals and adversaries aplenty, but friends and suitors in even greater number. She loves a good drink, loves dancing even more, and spends her free time with the common citizens of the city. More frequently, she's legislating in the council or negotiating in a secret corner of the Court of Whispers, trading for information or sending spies on missions.

She has a complex relationship with her homeland. While she loves Akharin Sangar, she refuses to bend to the will of its angelic ruler, [Atash](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/atash-jttrc.md). Rather than oppose him directly, she plays a delicate political game even as she worries about the future of her native land.

![Speaker Sholeh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/007-01-006.speaker-sholeh.webp#center)

In recent years, the weight of leadership has taken a toll on [Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md). She picks her scales in private as she tries to find relief.

##### Personality Trait

"True leaders must see what others do not, but they must remain connected to those they lead."

##### Ideal

"I will find the missing twelve and bring back the full glory of the Radiant Citadel."

##### Bond

"I love the city and all its people. I will do anything for them."

##### Flaw

"Do I exist only because others need me?"

### Shieldbearers

Since their founding, the Shieldbearers have led the Radiant Citadel's rescue and relocation missions. Typically organized in cohorts of four to six members, they are deployed to lands in crisis. Strict rules of engagement prevent them from impacting local conditions or taking sides in a conflict; their mandate allows them only to extract those in danger and defend themselves if attacked. They are among the bravest of the Citadel, and heroes who die in service to the Shieldbearers receive the city's highest honors.

Shieldbearers stand ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the vulnerable and the defenseless. Many members adhere to a tradition of getting a ritual scar or tattoo after each successful deployment, designed to represent a pivotal moment in that quest. The most accomplished veterans display such body art with pride.

Many adventurers who come to the Radiant Citadel eventually join the Shieldbearers, particularly those with the [folk hero](Mechanics/backgrounds/folk-hero.md), [soldier](Mechanics/backgrounds/soldier.md), or [outlander](Mechanics/backgrounds/outlander.md) backgrounds.

#### Arayat

Arayat (neutral, human [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) was born to a family of Dayawlongon freedom fighters who had no more wars to fight. Peace did not bring them prosperity, and the family's glory faded. Arayat grew up on the streets until luck brought him to the Radiant Citadel. He soon joined the Shieldbearers, which gave him meaning and purpose. Defying the odds, Arayat has survived hundreds of deployments to the most dangerous situations across the founding civilizations and beyond. He is a master of the Dayawlongon martial art of eskrima and favors a pair of shortswords in combat.

Now in his forties, he leads the Shieldbearers. He is a canny tactician and a highly competent leader, but he bristles against the rules of engagement imposed on the Shieldbearers by the Speakers for the Ancestors. He has cremated a hundred fallen comrades-in-arms and seen horrors few can comprehend. The toll has pushed him to his limits, and he believes a more aggressive, proactive strategy will save lives. But thus far, he has not defied the council.

In secret, Arayat drinks heavily. It is the only way he can sleep at night.

##### Personality Trait

"I will do anything and everything to protect the innocent."

##### Ideal

"I was born to save those who cannot save themselves."

##### Bond

"The Shieldbearers are my family and the Citadel my home."

##### Flaw

"I cannot stop seeing the faces of those I've lost."

## Citadel Defenses

The Radiant Citadel's location within the Deep Ethereal makes it difficult to assault. It keeps no standing army, but its council for defense has contingency plans it frequently refines based on intelligence from the Court of Whispers.

The city's primary protection is a powerful ward that can be activated by the Speakers for the Ancestors. When all fifteen are assembled in the council room at the center of the Preserve, by unanimous consent they can erect a diamond sphere that envelops the entire city. The diamond sphere resembles the Auroral Diamond in texture and color and deflects all attacks. Nothing can pass or teleport through it.

If the diamond sphere cannot be erected for any reason, the Radiant Citadel is not helpless. Due to its many mysteries and its magical properties, the city attracts an unusually large number of powerful adventurers and spellcasters. If the citadel is attacked, no fewer than a dozen [archmages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) and twenty [mages](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) led by [Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md) rally. If required, Arayat, commander of the Shieldbearers, also mobilizes his Shieldbearer [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md), while the other Speakers for the Ancestors call on the citizenry to bolster the city's defense.

The Auroral Diamond's illumination also provides strong protection. It radiates bright light throughout the city and dim light 1,000 feet beyond the city's borders. This light is akin to sunlight, which many natives of the Ethereal Plane and evil Undead abhor.

## Entering the Citadel

Most visitors come to the city by passage on one of the Concord Jewels. However, it's possible to find the Citadel through exploration of the Deep Ethereal. The Auroral Diamond acts like a beacon for the lost and hopeless, and many who seek the Radiant Citadel within the Deep Ethereal find their way there within a few days of searching.

There is only one official entrance to the Radiant Citadel: the Passage of Respite. The Concord Jewels dock adjacent to it, and people using other means to travel to the city are directed by guards to enter through it.

At any time, six [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) are stationed at the Passage of Respite. They are led by a [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) responsible for accepting tolls. These guards often employ magic items, such as [helms of telepathy](Mechanics/items/helm-of-telepathy.md), when suspicious of the motives of a visitor. A [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) from the House of Convalescence also attends the gate, ready to assist the ailing.

It's possible to bypass the Passage of Respite by teleporting or flying into the city, but anyone caught doing so faces massive fines, and repeat offenders risk banishment.

## Legends and Lore

Two hundred and fifty years ago, the great brass dragon [Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md) undertook a quest to find the Radiant Citadel. For millennia, the dragons of her lineage had recounted tales of its glory. As threats loomed on the horizon, [Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md) looked to the legend of the Radiant Citadel as salvation.

[Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md) gathered a mighty expeditionary force of adventurers from the civilizations she believed originally created the Radiant Citadel. Their travels took them across perilous planes and to distant worlds, and many died or gave up in despair. Only a quarter of the heroes who set out completed [Sholeh](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/sholeh-jttrc.md)'s quest, but the adventurers' sacrifices were rewarded. In the depths of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel lay dormant and abandoned by all but the Incarnates of the Preserve of the Ancestors. Yet it was undiminished in its grandeur, waiting for its inheritors to reawaken its power for a new era.

Many believe that the full potential of the Radiant Citadel can be unlocked only when the twelve missing civilizations are found and their representatives join the Speakers for the Ancestors. Some hypothesize the Citadel can unleash an incredible weapon, while others believe the Concord Jewels can be used to travel anywhere in the multiverse, or that the Radiant Citadel can be shifted between planes. The most fervent dream about tapping the power of the Auroral Diamond to resurrect lost civilizations and worlds.

Some scholars studying the Radiant Citadel's origins posit that the Citadel is a relic of the mythical First World and was a vital center of diplomacy between great cultures before a cataclysm shattered that world. Others speculate that it was a fortress, a refuge, or even a weapon in a war that transpired in the last days of the First World. Thus far, the Dawn Incarnates have declined to answer scholars' questions on the subject.

Recently, two founding civilizations were discovered and reconnected to the Citadel: the Tayyib Empire and Umizu (detailed in "Beyond the Radiant Citadel" at the end of this book). This success has prompted new rumors in the Court of Whispers about the twelve civilizations still missing and how they might be found.

## Using the Citadel

![Fleeing disaster, a family...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/008-01-007.concord-jewel-base.webp#center "Fleeing disaster, a family discovers the base of a Concord Jewel—a gateway to the Radiant Citadel")

The Radiant Citadel links to a multitude of worlds. While the fifteen lands presented in this book are the best known, you can decide where else the Concord Jewels reach and what connections they create to future adventures.

### Reaching the Radiant Citadel

While the Concord Jewels already create paths between many realms, you can place the missing Jewels anywhere you decide, linking more lands to the Radiant Citadel. Characters can learn about and travel to the Radiant Citadel, or their adventures might begin in the city. Consider the following ways to introduce the Radiant Citadel in your campaign:

- **Citadel Locals.** The Radiant Citadel is a hub for those seeking adventure, but it's also home to thousands. Either the characters have lived in the city all their lives, or they're stationed there by a world-hopping organization.  
- **Founding Residents.** The characters are from locations detailed in the gazetteers throughout this book. They already know about the Radiant Citadel but journey to it seeking to learn more.  
- **Ruin Explorers.** A group discovers that the land they're adventuring in was once the site of one of the founding civilizations. That civilization is lost, but the Concord Jewel connecting it to the Citadel remains.  
- **Sanctuary Seekers.** A disaster threatens the characters' home, but their timely discovery of a Concord Jewel allows them and their community—a forgotten founding civilization—to escape.  

### Connecting Adventures

The Radiant Citadel is a useful tool for connecting D&D adventures. The Citadel doesn't connect to all places in the multiverse—just the Material Plane locations linked to it by the Concord Jewels.

As you develop your campaign, consider what adventures—or parts of lengthy adventures—you want to run. Rather than spending time determining how characters get between remote locales, create links between adventure sites via the Radiant Citadel. Perhaps your next adventure is in a land presented in this book, or maybe it's somewhere else you decide has a Concord Jewel that links it to the Citadel. Use the Citadel's network of Jewels to create permanent connections between any lands and adventure sites you please. Groups from the Citadel, like the Shieldbearers or the spies in the Court of Whispers, can then point the way toward adventure. This makes the Radiant Citadel a useful bridge between wherever your characters are and any adventure in your D&D library.
