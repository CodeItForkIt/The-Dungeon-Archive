# Trail of Destruction
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 106* 

*An Adventure for 8th-Level Characters*

Disaster might strike at any moment, a truth the characters learn soon after arriving in the volcanic region of Tletepec. The town of Etizalan reels from monstrous attacks and unexplained earthquakes, leading the community's leaders to send for aid. When these requests go unanswered, the townsfolk enlist the characters to seek answers. The party must cross a region in the throes of volcanic upheaval and locate a shrine known as the Gate of Illumination. There the characters must placate a fiery creature awakened from its age-long slumber or face region-wide devastation.

## Background

Volcanic eruptions have been devastating the region around the town of Etizalan. Ordinarily, scholars called the Watchers of the Ashes predict volcanic eruptions and warn local folk, mitigating loss of life. Lately though, more and more eruptions evade detection.

[Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md), one of Etizalan's leaders, believes the gods have grown angry and seeks to placate them. She has collected offerings from her town's people and now heads to the shrine known as the Gate of Illumination to pray for an end to the danger.

Unknown to [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md), dangerous Elemental creatures roam the land. Salamanders and fire snakes serve Izel, a powerful creature known as a tlexolotl. Tlexolotls, long thought to be myths, slumber within the volcanoes of Tletepec. So long as the tlexolotls are dormant, the volcanoes they slumber in are quiet. When they awaken, the volcanic dangers across Tletepec increase.

Izel, finding himself the only one of his kind active in the region, seeks to awaken his fellow tlexolotls. The salamanders allied with him are stealing offerings meant for the gods and plan to offer them to sleeping tlexolotls to rouse the creatures. If large enough offerings are made, the tlexolotls are sure to awaken, unleashing volcanic devastation.

### Pronunciation Guide

In Tletlahtolli, the language spoken alongside Common in Tletepec, when tl appears at the end of a word, it creates a sound like the **tl** in **subtle**, **brittle**, or **rattle**. The Tletepec Pronunciations table notes how to pronounce key names in this adventure.

### Setting the Adventure

Use the following suggestions to help contextualize Tletepec in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Visitors from the Radiant Citadel arrive in Tletepec north of Etizalan and begin their investigation there. You can use the "Tletepec Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure as a starting point to detail the region.  
- **Forgotten Realms.** The region of Tletepec might sprawl among the Peaks of Flame in Chult or the Firesteap Mountains east of the Lake of Steam.  
- **Greyhawk.** Tletepec could easily exist in the volcanic region where the Hellfurnaces meets the Amedio Jungle, just south of Cauldron. It could also be added as one of the Olman Islands.  

### Character Hooks

Consider the following ways to involve characters in this adventure.

- **Elemental Attacks.** [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md), the assembly chief of Etizalan, requests aid to defend her city from attacks by hostile elemental creatures. By the time the characters arrive, though, things have grown far more dire.  
- **Natural Disaster.** A devotee of a nature god asks the characters to visit Tletepec and learn what methods the locals use to placate their tempestuous gods. The characters' contact hopes these techniques can be used to calm natural upheavals in other lands.  
- **Prepared for the Worst.** The Shieldbearers of the Radiant Citadel hire the characters to visit Tletepec to verify rumors that the region is becoming dangerous, so they can prepare for an influx of refugees. They suggest the characters start their investigations near Etizalan.  

## Starting the Adventure

![Salamander raiders ambush ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/069-08-001.salamander-raiders.webp#center "Salamander raiders ambush Ameyali's caravan on the road near Etizalan")

The adventure begins as the characters approach the town of Etizalan. Before they reach the community, they encounter a caravan being raided. Read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The road weaves through a stretch of rain forest that flanks a deep valley, drawing near the town of Etizalan. Past a bend, smoke rises through the trees and shouts ring out. An overturned wagon lies in the road, and through the smoke you can see people being attacked by serpentine creatures wreathed in flame.
^24e

Two [fire snakes](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) and two [salamanders](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) have ambushed three travelers from Etizalan. The three travelers use the [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) stat block and fight to defend a wagon full of food, flowers, and colorful crafts. If the characters defend the travelers, the Elemental creatures focus their attacks on the newcomers.

The area within 25 feet of the overturned wagon is obscured by smoke, which can be dispersed by a strong wind in 1 round. Flames burn in the forested area on either side of the 15-foot-wide road. Any creature who enters the burning forest must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) points of fire damage. The fire produces a great deal of smoke but will burn out in the wet forest in about 10 minutes. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check realizes the flames won't spread far.

### After the Battle

Once the characters deal with the vicious Elementals, their problems aren't over. The ground heaves as a small earthquake ripples through the area. Characters must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to keep their footing. The sound of wood splintering and trees falling echoes from deeper in the forest, but the tremor soon passes.

In the aftermath of the battle and earthquake, the travelers are thankful for the characters' help. Their leader introduces herself as [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md).

#### Ameyali

[Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) (neutral good, human [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)) has lived in Etizalan for years. After fire elementals destroyed her birth village and killed her parents, neighbors took her in and moved to Etizalan. There she learned a sense of community and acquired a strong desire to help others. As a youth, her aptitude with tools and weapons led her to train with the inventors known as the Shapers of Obsidian in Itzimico. She returned to Etizalan as an adult to ensure her birth village's fate would never befall her new home. Her many useful inventions impressed the people of Etizalan, and she eventually became a local leader.

##### Personality Trait

"I like building things. Seeing a complete work after hours of placing pieces is wonderful."

##### Ideal

"I want my inventions to ensure fewer children lose their parents."

##### Bond

"I always wear the necklace my adoptive sister gave me. When I feel anxious about a project, I hold the necklace to give me confidence."

##### Flaw

"The world disappears when I'm focused. I often don't notice people talking to me at such times."

#### Ameyali's Request

[Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) can use her magic and three [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) she has to heal wounded characters. She gladly gives the characters any unused potions, sharing her wish that these items will keep the brave travelers safe.

While her companions right their cart, [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) can answer the characters' questions. She then asks if her caravan might travel back to Etizalan with them. Along the way, she shares the following information:

- The region around Etizalan is suffering a spate of earthquakes and incursions from fiery monsters.  
- Three days ago, [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) sent four of the town's best warriors to seek insight from the Watchers of the Ashes. They dwell at the Twin Gods Observatory, a site of volcanic study that normally warns Etizalan of impending earthquakes and eruptions. The warriors have not returned.  
- [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) and her fellow travelers intended to look for the warriors and then take offerings to the Gate of Illumination, a shrine to the gods, in hopes of placating them and quelling the earthquakes.  
- The group has traveled only a couple of miles from Etizalan, and the journey has already proven more dangerous than expected. For their safety, her group must abandon its mission.  

Once the characters and [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) reach Etizalan, she thanks them again and asks if they'll do her another favor. She's still concerned about her town's warriors. She asks the characters to go to the Twin Gods Observatory and find out what happened to them. In return, she offers to pay the characters 400 gp each, and they will have earned the gratitude of her people.

If the characters have questions about monsters in the area or how to prepare for the journey, [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) suggests they talk to other locals (see the following section).

## Exploring Etizalan

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The town of Etizalan has seen better days. Although its colorfully painted stone homes and shady, tree-lined streets are welcoming, an air of urgency lingers over the community. Many of the stalls in the town's paved central market are closed as locals shore up buildings damaged by the recent earthquake or reinforce the town walls.
^257

Enough local shops are still open that the characters can find any common goods they seek. A local inn called the Jolly Cotinga can also host guests, giving them a place to stay and a delicious meal of rice, fruit, and smoked turkey for 1 gp.

Characters who speak with the locals about threats in the area each learn one of the following pieces of information:

- Most of the creatures attacking the area are [salamanders](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) or [fire snakes](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) that dwell near volcanoes. They don't usually attack settlements.  
- The earthquake the town recently suffered is the fourth this month. Earthquakes aren't uncommon, but this is far more than usual.  
- A [fire giant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) named [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) roams the territory around Etizalan and its volcano, and the folk of the city know to avoid him.  

When the characters are ready to depart, [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) provides a map of the region outlining the path to Twin Gods Observatory.

## The Way Up

The path to Twin Gods Observatory snakes through the rain forest, then climbs into the hills near the Twin Gods Volcanoes. Trails along the river flowing out of Atialli Lake lead to the town of Xoxotla, about 17 miles away. From there, paths lead another 9 miles to the observatory. The whole trip takes just over a day to complete at a normal pace.

### Volcanic Threats

Volcanic activity increases as the awakening of the tlexolotl Izel affects the region. While the characters travel, the earth occasionally shakes anew. During the journey, roll on the Volcanic Awakening table every 12 hours or whenever you desire. You can also have two [salamanders](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) ambush the party as these volcanic events take place.

**Volcanic Awakening**

`dice: [](09-trail-of-destruction.md#^volcanic-awakening)`

| dice: d4 | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | A fumarole opens alongside the road, venting noxious gases 25 feet in all directions. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) poison damage. |
| 2 | Falling ash lightly obscures the characters' surroundings for the next hour. |
| 3 | The ground suddenly collapses, creating a 30-foot-deep fissure that's 120 feet long and 20 feet wide. The gap severs the road ahead of the characters. |
| 4 | The earth cracks, revealing magma flowing below. A [fire snake](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) rises from the crack and attacks the first creature it sees before retreating after 1 round. |
^volcanic-awakening

### Xoxotla

Xoxotla is the largest community in the Tletepec region. Characters might stop, rest, and resupply here, safe from fiery threats or monster attack. See the "Tletepec Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure for more details on Xoxotla.

### Daring Dancer

![Ollin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/070-08-002.ollin.webp#center)

As the characters are leaving Xoxotla, an impossible figure to ignore hails them. This is [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md), a tiefling performer with turquoise patterned skin. They're headed the same direction as the characters and are eager to travel with the party, both for company and protection. The dancer is kind-hearted but has an over-the-top stage persona they rarely let slip. In return, they offer to be the characters' guide and good luck charm on the road. Even if the characters don't accept [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md)'s company, the performer is traveling in the same direction and tags along anyway. [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) keeps their distance only if threatened or rebuffed in extremely clear terms.

#### Ollin

[Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) is a chaotic good tiefling. They use the [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) stat block but have [Performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance) +3 rather than [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion), and they can speak Common; Ignan; and the local language, Tletlahtolli.

[Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) is a bombastic, traveling dancer who enjoys participating in local celebrations and entices Tletepecs to dance their cares away. [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) uses their skillful dances and optimistic view of the power of the gods to lighten others' hearts. With the increasing dangers in the region, [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) has decided to head to Twin Gods Observatory on behalf of Tletepec's people and personally find out how to stop the problem. The performer knows the value of a good supporting team, though.

##### Personality Trait

"I love to help people and am not afraid to take on tasks I don't know how to do. I'll figure it out!"

##### Ideal

"I want my public to forget their worries for a moment, letting me guide them to a happy place."

##### Bond

"I want to spread the smiles I see on the faces of those I entertain."

##### Flaw

"My stage persona cloaks my insecurities. Sometimes I go to extremes to keep up this facade."

## Twin Gods Observatory

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Above the trees on the rocky slope ahead rises a tower covered in elaborate carvings of local animals and majestic mountains. Beyond it, smoke rises from a volcanic peak.
^262

Twin Gods Observatory is home to a group of scholars and regional guardians called the Watchers of the Ashes. These scientists observe and record the behavior of Tletepec's volcanoes, predicting eruptions and warning locals before danger strikes. The Observatory itself is a narrow, 120-foot-high tower.

### Meeting the Watchers

When the characters arrive, three Watchers (neutral, human [acolytes](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md)) greet them with a hint of disdain. The Watchers explain they are aware of the unusual volcanic activity and are doing their best to determine the cause, but their work will proceed faster if they're not interrupted. They initially claim to know nothing about warriors from Etizalan.

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces a Watcher to behave more hospitably, whereupon the acolyte shares the following information:

- The observatory has been besieged by inquiries from across the land seeking answers the scholars don't have.  
- Dozens of volcanoes are showing activity across Tletepec, which is unprecedented.  
- The acolyte doesn't recall warriors from Etizalan arriving, but the Watchers' leader, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md), might.  
- [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) has been tirelessly observing the volcanoes from atop the observatory.  

Regardless of the acolytes' attitudes, the characters are free to enter the tower.

![Tonalli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/071-08-003.tonalli.webp#center)

### Inside the Observatory

The interior of Twin Gods Observatory is hollow, with a spiral stone staircase rising to a roof with a commanding view of the region. Carvings along the observatory's interior depict volcanic events and smoke formations, which the Watchers consult to inform their predictions. The stairs leading to the top of the tower are shallow and have no railing, winding around an open, 15-foot-wide, central space. The stairs count as "difficult terrain" and, following the steps, the route from the bottom of the tower to the top is 200 feet long.

A character who spends at least 5 minutes examining the carvings inside the observatory and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notes a carving of a gigantic, frilled reptile bursting from an exploding volcano. If asked, any of the Watchers identify this creature as a mythical being called a [tlexolotl](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/tlexolotl-jttrc.md), a spirit said to sleep in volcanoes. Most Watchers don't believe tlexolotls are real.

### Disaster Strikes

![As volcanic eruptions shak...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/072-08-004.ancient-twin-observatory.webp#center "As volcanic eruptions shake the earth, the ancient Twin Gods Observatory topples")

When a character climbs to at least half the height of the observatory—whether using the steps or via another method—the structure begins shaking, and a crack like a thunderclap sounds from below. Anyone outside the observatory sees the structure sway, while those inside feel the floor pitch beneath them. Creatures on the stairs inside the tower must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall. Unless characters have been tracking their ascent, assume they've climbed 60 feet when the earthquake hits, causing them to take 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and knocking them [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) if they fall.

#### Countdown to Ruin

After the initial quake, have characters roll initiative to emphasize the urgency of the situation and track their movement through the tower. Twin Gods Observatory will collapse after 6 rounds or whenever feels appropriately dramatic. Emphasize the tower's precarious state by describing the continued swaying of the building and crumbling of walls.

#### Tonalli

The leader of the Watchers, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) (lawful neutral, dwarf [priest](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md)), is on the rooftop when the structure begins to collapse. He survives only if the characters reach the roof and encourage him to flee back down the stairs immediately or save him via some other method. Desperate to escape, he eagerly follows the characters' instructions.

#### Collapse

When the tower collapses, each creature in or atop Twin Gods Observatory must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, a creature falls from its current height and takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, but lands free of the collapsing structure. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes the falling damage and an additional 17 (`5d6`) bludgeoning damage, and the creature is buried under rubble. A creature buried in this way is [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained), and has total cover. It can try to dig itself free as an action, ending the [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions on itself and crawling to the surface with a successful DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.

A creature that is neither [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) nor [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried in the rubble. Once free, that creature is no longer [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) or [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the collapsed structure.

### In the Ruins

As dust rises from the ruins of Twin Gods Observatory, the earthquake ceases. All of the Watchers survived, with the possible exception of [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md). If the characters didn't rescue [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md), the other Watchers soon find his body. They entreat the characters to rush the dead scholar back to Xoxotla, where he can be resurrected.

Once saved or revived, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) is thankful for the characters' help. If the characters explain why they came, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) tells them what he knows:

- [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md)'s warriors arrived three days earlier.  
- At the time they arrived, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) didn't have any theories about what was causing the eruptions, but he knew they were strongest near the volcano called Jademount.  
- [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) sent the warriors to the Gate of Illumination, a shrine to the gods on Jademount, to see if they could learn anything more. They haven't returned.  
- Just before the observatory collapsed, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md)'s research into the tower's writings and signs in the surrounding lands convinced him that the cause of the eruptions is a [tlexolotl](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/tlexolotl-jttrc.md)—a spirit of the volcanoes.  
- Tales say many of the volcanoes in Tletepec have tlexolotls dwelling within them. [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) believes these volcanic spirits are all gradually awaking at once—which in turn increases the activity of their volcanoes.  
- Based on his observations, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) believes there's already an awakened tlexolotl near where the volcanic disturbances began: Jademount.  

[Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) regrets sending [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md)'s people to the Gate of Illumination—he didn't realize the danger. He asks the characters to travel to the shrine to check on the warriors and seek signs of the tlexolotl.

## Traveling to the Gate

[Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md) or other locals can easily mark a trail on the characters' map leading to the Gate of Illumination, a well-known sacred site. The route from the ruins of Twin Gods Observatory leads 9 miles back to Xoxotla. From there, it follows the Atialli River 18 miles to the shrine. At a normal pace, the journey takes a little over a day.

As the characters travel, volcanic events continue to rock the region. Consult the "Volcanic Threats" section earlier in the adventure for dangers that might occur. Additionally, at a point between the Xoxotla and the shrine, the characters come upon the aftermath of a battle.

### Ashen Battlefield

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Four bodies lie where they've fallen on the road ahead, all showing burn marks and spear wounds. Broken arrows and fragments of a shattered wooden cart are strewn about.
^26d

The four bodies were human travelers from the town of Itzimico who were headed to Twin Gods Observatory to seek answers about the growing volcanic disturbances from the Watchers of the Ashes. Like [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md)'s warriors, they carried offerings of fruits and crafts, but those have been stolen. A character who investigates the bodies and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds burns on them and sizable, snakelike tracks nearby, suggesting the travelers were killed by salamanders. The tracks lead toward the Gate of Illumination, with a few dropped prickly pears along the path—offerings the raiders stole.

#### Giant's Wrath

As the characters prepare to move on, a roar comes from a forested rise over the road. The towering figure of a fire giant pushes through the trees toward the characters. "Go back!" he yells in Common. "Abandon your offerings! You know not what you do!"

This is the [fire giant](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md), whom characters might have learned about in Etizalan. [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) is neutral. He wields a massive hammer, which deals bludgeoning damage but is otherwise identical to a fire giant's Greatsword attack. He can speak Common, Giant, and Tletlahtolli.

[Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) isn't interested in fighting unless he's attacked first, but he blocks the characters' way and tries to frighten them into returning the way they came. Calming the giant and convincing him to talk requires either a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or appropriate roleplaying.

If the characters convince [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) to talk, he shares the distressing information he has recently learned.

#### What Xocopol Knows

![Xocopol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/073-08-005.xocopol.webp#center)

Like many of his kin, [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) dislikes the tendency of Humanoids to build settlements near the volcanic mountains. The awakening tlexolotls, however, have made the small folk of these lands the lesser of two evils. [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md)'s people have long known about the tlexolotls that slumber deep in the region's mountains and don't consider them myths.

If the characters calm [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) and explain they aren't headed to the Gate of Illumination to make an offering, the fire giant stops threatening them and shares the following information:

- Tlexolotls dwell deep in volcanoes. When their sleep is disturbed, volcanic eruptions often follow.  
- The [tlexolotl](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/tlexolotl-jttrc.md) that inhabits Jademount has awakened. [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) has seen it moving inside the volcanic pool connected to the Gate of Illumination.  
- [Salamanders](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) and [fire snakes](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) serve this tlexolotl. They have been stealing offerings meant for the gods and are carrying them back to Jademount.  
- [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) doesn't know why the tlexolotl is hoarding offerings, but he has seen salamanders going to volcanoes throughout the region with them.  

[Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) doesn't know much more. While he's happy to fight any salamanders he encounters, he's too large to slip into the Gate of Illumination and find out what's happening there. If the characters are willing to do so, [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md) offers to travel with them and defend them along the way.

## Gate of Illumination

The Gate of Illumination is a centuries-old shrine consecrated to the gods of nature, fire, and renewal. It's cut into the slope of the Jademount volcano and tunnels to the lake of magma within the caldera. The slopes of Jademount are steep and treacherous to climb, making passage through the shrine the most direct route to the volcano's interior. Traditionally, offerings of flowers, fruits, and crafts are brought here and to similar shrines to thank the gods for their bounty, as the volcanic pools are viewed as passages to the gods' realm.

As the characters near the Gate of Illumination, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A well-traveled trail climbs into the mountains, the haze of volcanic smoke hanging overhead. The path ends at the entrance to a cavern carved with images of divine figures and gigantic lizards amid cracking mountains, clouds, and geometric flourishes. Crimson light emanates from within, and the smell of sulfur is thick in the air.
^271

Characters who noticed the tlexolotl carvings at the Twin Gods Observatory recognize similar imagery here. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) realizes the carvings depict reptilian spirits that dwell in volcanoes.

### Gate of Illumination Features

The following features are common to all areas of the shrine:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings throughout the shrine are 10 feet high.  
- **Heat and Gas.** The air in the shrine is heavy with smoke and heat. The shrine's magic keeps the temperature at 90 degrees Fahrenheit, despite its proximity to the volcano's magma. This same magic prevents volcanic gases from posing a threat, but these gases still lightly obscure every area within the shrine.  
- **Illumination.** Veins of magma thread the walls and fill magical lanterns throughout the shrine, illuminating each area with dim light.  

### Gate of Illumination Locations

#### I1: Cave Entrance

A 30-foot-long tunnel leads from the entrance of the shrine to its main chambers. Magical decorations look like veins of magma flowing through the walls, but they're cool to the touch and don't seep into the room. A character who has the Stonecunning trait can tell the passage isn't natural and was constructed using magic (no check required).

#### I2: Hall of Histories

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Bright murals cover the walls of this broad, pillared hall, depicting people through the ages receiving blessings from the gods. A stone double door stands at the far end of the room, while stairs rise to the west and another hall opens to the east.
^276

People who bring their offerings to the gods prepare their prayers in this area, meditating on the blessing they want. A [salamander](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) and four [fire snakes](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/fire-snake.md) are in this room. The salamander stands guard before the door to area I5, while each fire snake lingers near one of the room's pillars. These creatures are hostile and attack any strangers that enter the room.

##### Door

A narrow, 10-foot-tall stone double door bars the way to area I5. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to open the door. As the door opens, it grinds nosily, alerting any creatures in this room and areas I4 and I5.

##### Murals

The murals covering the walls depict several myths known throughout the region. Any of the legends mentioned in the "Tletepec" section at the end of this adventure might be represented here, such as the tale of the two lovers.

##### Dying Dancer

If [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) didn't join the characters in Xoxotla, the dancer came to the shrine on their own and fell victim to the salamander and fire snakes. The dancer has 0 hit points, is [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious), and will die if they don't receive healing within the next hour.

#### I3: Blessings Memorial

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Murals of people making offerings to the gods cover this room's walls. At the chamber's center stand three statues on short pedestals: one of a tiefling, one of a dwarf, and one of a human, all in poses of supplication. Two of the statues—the tiefling and the human—appear to be missing something.
^27b

This room memorializes some of the greatest offerings made to the gods, as well as legendary figures who made earnest sacrifices and were rewarded. The three statues at the room's center have inscriptions written in the local language, Tletlahtolli, that include the following details:

- **Leuchis.** At the north of the room, this white stone statue depicts a tiefling offering a sculpted ring to the heavens. His other arm is bent as if holding something, but it is empty. An etching at the base of the statue reads, "Leuchis, who traveled on the wind."  
- **Lilva.** In the middle of the room, this red stone statue of a dwarf holds a large urn as if about to take a drink. An etching on the statue's base reads, "Lilva, who brewed the waters of the gods."  
- **Pattox.** At the room's south, this blue stone statue of a human holds up a seed, offering it to the heavens. His other arm is crooked, as if holding something that's missing. The etching at the foot of the statue reads, "Pattox, who brought the rain with a seed."  

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes these statues as devout figures from local legends who earned the favor of the gods. If [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) is with the party, they can also share this information.

The statues are magical, but their power was disrupted when the urns held by two of the statues were removed. They're currently in areas I4 and I5. Only the urn on the statue of Lilva remains; inside the urn is a worn, stone cup.

If the empty white urn is placed back upon the statue of Leuchis, the urn fills with nonflammable oil. If the empty blue urn is placed back upon the statue of Pattox, the urn fills with water. Both urns magically fill in this way once per week.

If the contents of the white and blue urns are poured into the red urn, they create a bright red magical fluid that is equivalent to three [potions of resistance (fire)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-fire-resistance.md).

#### I4: Raided Memorial

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Shelves are carved into this room's walls, their contents swept onto the floor, reduced to shards of shattered pottery and heaps of ashes. A mural on the north wall depicts erupting volcanoes and smoke in the shape of tiny people drifting into the sky. Beneath the mural, a salamander lies curled in a corner.
^27d

This room held the ashes of priests who sought to be interred near the gods, along with small remembrances for the dead. Salamanders have raided this room and thrown most of the memorial items into the volcano, leaving little behind.

The salamander resting here is named Xind, and it was wounded during an encounter with [Xocopol](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/xocopol-jttrc.md).

##### Xind the Salamander

Xind is a [salamander](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) with 1 hit point and no will to fight. Upon seeing the characters, it throws up its hands and says in Ignan, "I give up." In return for being left alone, Xind is willing to tell the characters about Izel's plan to collect offerings and cast them into volcanoes across the region, waking dozens of other tlexolotls. It can also relate any other detail of the Izel's plot from the adventure's background.

##### Mural

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Knowledge ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check recognizes that the mural depicts a local myth about the Ashrise, a period when all the volcanoes in the area will erupt, devastating the region. If [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) is with the group, they can also explain the mural's significance.

##### Treasure

A character who spends at least 5 minutes sifting through the debris finds a sand-colored pouch embroidered with colorful, geometrically stylized animals. This is a [tan bag of tricks](Mechanics/items/bag-of-tricks-tan.md). Any creature created by the bag looks artistically stylized in a manner similar to the embroidery on the bag. This doesn't affect the creatures' statistics.

An intact white stone urn lies near the mural. This urn is part of one of the statues in area I3.

#### I5: Preparation Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Crates and heaps of supplies surround a stone altar with a flame burning in a depression at its center. Stone double doors lead to the north and south. The door to the north is carved with the image of a frilled, lizard-like creature amid flames.
^282

The salamanders serving Izel have brought the stolen offerings here. One [salamander](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/salamander.md) is currently organizing the offerings. It attacks any strangers who enter the chamber.

##### Altar

The stone altar is consecrated to the gods of fire and nature. A candle-sized flame burns in a bowl-sized depression upon its surface. The flame is magical and relights after 10 seconds if extinguished.

##### Gate

A 10-foot-tall stone double door bars the way to area I6. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to open the door. As the door opens, it grinds nosily across the ground, alerting any creatures in this room and area I6.

##### Offerings

The offerings consist of foodstuffs and colorful crafts with little monetary value. The edges of the room hold hundreds of pounds of such goods, all of which are flammable. If purposefully set aflame, all of the offerings burn up in less than 10 minutes. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices a blue stone urn amid the offerings. This urn is part of one of the statues in area I3.

##### Offering with Intention

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows locals value the intention behind the offerings they make more than an offering's monetary value. A small offering made with an earnest prayer to the gods is considered greater than a valuable offering made while going through the motions of piety. Should the offerings in this room be burned or thrown into the volcano along with a prayer to the gods, every character that participates in making the offering gains advantage on their next saving throw as a minor blessing. Destroying these offerings undermines Izel's plan, as the offerings are consecrated to the gods and can't be used to coax forth other tlexolotls.

#### I6: Caldera

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The masonry of the shrine gives way to the natural formation of the volcano's caldera. A blast of heat and gas billows off the lake of magma roiling here. At the magma's edge stands a pair of ornate altars carved of obsidian. Nearby, four humans are slumped against the west wall, their arms dangling from rusty manacles. Beyond, sooty rock juts into the molten lake. Something moves amid the lava.
^288

The magmatic pool at the heart of Jademount is the lair of the [tlexolotl](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/tlexolotl-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) named Izel. The tlexolotl resents any interruptions to his plans. The four humans chained to the wall are the missing warriors from Etizalan.

##### Izel

Izel emerges from the lava and speaks in Ignan, demanding the characters leave. If the characters don't respond, he attacks. If they do, he's willing to converse with them and explain the following:

- Izel awoke several months ago and can tell that the other tlexolotls dwelling in volcanoes across the region are still asleep. Izel treats these other tlexolotls as his family.  
- Izel has instructed his salamander servants to make offerings at the volcanoes where his family dwells and wake them. So far the salamanders have made some small offerings, causing other tlexolotls to stir.  
- Izel doesn't understand or care that the awakening tlexolotls endanger the region's populace. The Elemental has little experience with Humanoids or the concept of mortality.  
- The magma vents beneath the volcano connect to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Izel convinced the awed salamanders on the other side to assist him. He knows nothing of the vicious attacks they've conducted to fetch offerings for him.  

Through convincing roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can talk Izel out of his plans and persuade him to send his salamander allies away. Any such negotiation needs to account for the fact that Izel will be lonely if this happens. If [Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) is with the party, they volunteer to stay at the Gate of Illumination—[Ollin](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ollin-jttrc.md) believes keeping Izel content is important and wants to help keep the region safe (they also like the idea of having a regular audience).

##### Lava

A creature that enters the lava in this area for the first time on a turn or that starts its turn there takes 55 (`10d10`) fire damage.

##### Missing Warriors

The four missing warriors from Etizalan found their way to the Gates of Illumination and would have been killed by salamanders if Izel hadn't been curious about them. The tlexolotl can't understand them, so it has had them manacled to the western wall. If asked, they explain that the tlexolotl didn't harm them—it seemed curious about them, not hostile. The warriors use the stat blocks of [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md), but their weapons have been destroyed and they each have 1 hit point remaining. Their manacles have no locks, as the salamanders melted them closed. Each manacle has AC 19, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage, or can be broken as an action with a successful DC 18 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Treasure

The obsidian altars are bare except for four ruby-encrusted torch sconces, two on each altar. The sconces are easily removed, and each is worth 750 gp.

## Conclusion

After the characters defeat or placate Izel, the remaining salamanders and fire snakes in the region return to the Plane of Fire. Without offerings being made to awaken the region's other tlexolotls, the volcanic threats cease, and the characters find their travels back to Etizalan free of volcanic dangers. If the warriors from Etizalan survived, they ask to accompany the characters.

Back in Etizalan, [Ameyali](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ameyali-jttrc.md) is eager to hear the characters' story. So long as the volcanic threats to the region have ended, she rewards the characters with 250 gp each regardless of whether her town's warriors survived. If the warriors did survive, through, local children also show the thanks of the whole community by gifting the characters a local treasure, an axolotl-shaped [decanter of endless water](Mechanics/items/decanter-of-endless-water.md).

If the characters fail to stop Izel's plan, the tlexolotl completes his offerings, and volcanoes across Tletepec begin erupting as numerous other [tlexolotl](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/tlexolotl-jttrc.md) awaken—some larger and more powerful than Izel. How the characters contribute to saving the region could be the focus of future adventures.

## Tletepec Gazetteer

In Tletepec, it's said ancient heroes transformed themselves into volcanoes long ago and now keep vigil over the land. The region's inhabitants view these volcanoes as sacred sites and believe their offerings pass through the volcanoes' flames into the realms of the gods beyond.

Tletepec is surrounded by mountains that enclose lush forests and open valleys. The history of Tletepec is a cycle of destruction and rebirth: ashfall and lava lay waste to the earth, and forests regrow from the fertile soil destruction leaves behind. The locals settle these fertile areas, founding new villages and cities as the landscape changes.

Tletepecs fear a long-prophesied devastation, a time known as the Ashrise, when all the regions' volcanoes will erupt. Scholars like the Watchers of the Ashes look for signs of this doom and seek ways to prevent it. Others wish to use the threat of destruction for their own nefarious ends.

### Features

Those familiar with Tletepec know the following facts:

- **Hallmarks.** Tletepec is known for its cycles of destruction and rebirth. The people of the land live alongside dangerous volcanoes and make communal offerings to the gods to prevent eruptions.  
- **People of Tletepec.** The population is mostly humans and dwarves with brown skin and dark hair. Tieflings are common in many settlements and often have skin tones evocative of minerals or gems. Other folk are rarer and are most commonly visitors.  
- **Languages.** The language of Tletepec is Tletlahtolli, but people also know Common.  

### Noteworthy Sites

Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes constantly change the landscape of Tletepec, moving landmarks and destroying roads. Yet, several noteworthy sites have endured for generations.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/077-map-8.2-tletepec-player.webp#gallery)

#### Xoxotla

Tletepec's capital city, Xoxotla, is a refuge for those forced to evacuate settlements elsewhere in the region. Its founder, Meztli, sought a safe place for her family and made a significant offering to the gods. In return, the gods created a stable plain where she built her new home. A group of guides and explorers called the Trail Keepers base their operations in Xoxotla. From here, the group keeps paths across the region safe and clear. They are often at odds with fire giants that dwell among the volcanoes, who claim that their homes were destroyed when the gods moved mountains to create Xoxotla's plain.

#### Itzimico

As volcanic ash drifts into the sea, it turns the coastal waters of the Obsidian Gulf dense and acidic, making docking a challenge. The magical piers of the town of Itzimico filter the seawater and allow ships to dock safely—for a moderate fee. Captains who avoid docking here often find their boats stuck in the water and at the mercy of the fire giants and dangerous beasts along the coast.

The city is controlled by the Shapers of Obsidian, a group of scholars who create magic inventions that protect the city. These scholars constantly test new magic on the city's walls, which are designed to protect against lava rivers and ash storms. They are always willing to reward those brave enough to help them try out their newest inventions.

#### Twin Gods Observatory

This observatory stands on the slopes of the Twin Gods Volcanoes. From here, members of a group called the Watchers of the Ashes study the surrounding volcanoes and seek to predict disasters before they strike. Centuries of records and myths are etched into the observatory's walls. The oldest Watchers claim all the information necessary to predict and prevent the Ashrise is recorded here.

### Life in Tletepec

The volcanoes of Tletepec are a fact of life. Most locals live their lives focused on the promise of what's to come, not impending doom.

#### Family and Home

Family is a cornerstone of Tletepec society. From birth, Tletepecs are surrounded by family and are protected by their neighbors. People help each other and their community, and they are fond of saying, "Strangers are just family you haven't met."

Tletepecs build villages near the land's many volcanoes, but travel between villages can be challenging, as the dirt paths that connect them often shift or are blocked. Therefore, Tletepecs make great efforts to sustain the common culture and values that unite them, embodying that culture in their food and festivals. Spicy dishes are a specialty; the hotter the feeling on the tongue, the more delicious the food is considered. Peppers appear in every meal in a variety of forms. Festivals often feature turkey covered in molli, a thick, sweet-spicy sauce made from a mix of peppers, seeds, and cacao. Most Tletepecs have a sweet tooth, especially if it involves cacao. Regional candy combines the sweet and spicy flavors of local fruits, and Tletepecs enjoy watching foreigners react to these unique tastes.

#### Leadership

Each Tletepec village is ruled by a rotating assembly, a group of five rulers led by an assembly chief. The chief is chosen through a series of trials that vary from village to village, ranging from tests of knowledge to trials of physical prowess. In earlier days, villages that fought over resources were quickly wiped out, while those whose people cooperated survived and grew, so cooperation has become the central tenet in Tletepec.

#### Offerings and Celebrations

Offerings are an integral part of life and religious celebrations in Tletepec. Twice a year, every village assembles a communal offering to the gods to request blessings, chief among them protection from disaster. The gathered offerings are carried by a caravan of walkers and wagons to a shrine at the nearest volcano, accompanied by a priest to perform the offering. Villagers with individual requests might follow the caravan to make their own offerings. These offerings—typically consisting of foodstuffs and colorful crafts—are dropped into the volcano, where it's believed they're conveyed to the realms of the gods.

On the travelers' return, villagers celebrate for several days, thanking the gods for their help. Event preparations begin many days in advance and involve the entire village. At the end of the festival's final night, villagers light the fire eagle: a fireworks-filled eagle effigy whose burning signifies the offerings given and whose light represents the blessings from the gods.

#### Watchers of the Ashes

The Watchers of the Ashes are a religious coalition dedicated to appeasing the gods and monitoring the land's volcanoes. Watchers look for signs of imminent volcanic eruptions from the observatories the order builds and maintains, measuring and interpreting every smoke ring, ash storm, and tremor to keep the folk of Tletepec safe. The order also watches for signs signaling the disastrous Ashrise and researches ways to prevent it.

#### Names

Most names in Tletepec have meanings drawn from words in the Tletlahtolli language related to nature. Many Tletepecs change their name on reaching adulthood, choosing a new name that reflects their accomplishments or aspirations. The following are examples of common names in Tletepec:

- **Feminine.** Tzalanti, Xochitl, Yeyetzi, Yul  
- **Masculine.** Mixtli, Tequihua, [Tonalli](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/tonalli-jttrc.md), Yoali  
- **Gender-Neutral.** Ameli, Chamani, Citlalli, Quetzalli, Sinti, Tenampi, Tlalli, Yoltzin  
- **Surnames.** Aca, Atzin, Coyac, Pale, Temich, Tepoz, Xopa, Zaca  

### Legends of Tletepec

Long ago, two lovers led their people away from war and conflict, looking for a new place to settle. They and their people were starving by the time they arrived at a peaceful but infertile land. The lovers offered themselves to the land, fusing their souls to create the two oldest volcanoes in what is now Tletepec, but the land remained barren. Desperate, the people offered everything they had to the spirits in the volcanoes, even the last of their food. The spirits accepted this offering in the name of the gods and blessed the land. Since then, the people of Tletepec have offered a portion of what they have to the volcanoes to maintain these blessings.

It's said that when the lovers became volcanoes, their memories of mortal life began to fade. When they forget their past completely, Tletepec will be destroyed by the Ashrise, a chain volcanic eruption that will cover the land in lava and ash. The Ashrise is certain to destroy everything in Tletepec, even as it plants seeds for a new civilization to grow.

^tletepec-adventures

### Characters from Tletepec

If players want to create characters from Tletepec, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**What offerings have you made to gods?** Did you regret the loss of your offering? Did you receive the blessing you sought? Did you expect this or not?

**Have you had to flee a natural disaster?** What happened? Did you lose something while fleeing? What happened to your friends and family?

**Have you trained with the Watchers of the Ashes**? Do you seek omens in smoke or disasters? Do you seek evidence of some coming doom?

## Tlexolotl

Tlexolotls are gigantic, salamander-like creatures that slumber deep in the magma of dormant volcanoes. A tlexolotl drowses amid the molten depths for centuries, rising only rarely to gorge itself on massive amounts of animal and plant life before returning to its slumber. Should a tlexolotl's sleep be disturbed—whether by intruders in its volcanic lair or the eruption of its molten home—the lava-drenched brute emerges in a rage, rampaging forth until its belly is full and its volcano is quiet once more.

Despite a tlexolotl's destructive prowess, the land around its volcano is often naturally abundant. It's common for those who live nearby to honor the tlexolotl as a protector of the land, as the ash it creates rejuvenates the soil and encourages life to flourish.

![Tlexolotl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/078-637937472233889881.webp#center)
