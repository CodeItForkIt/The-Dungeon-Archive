# The Fiend of Hollow Mine
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel, p. 48* 

*An Adventure for 4th-Level Characters*

A deadly magical curse called sereno is killing people in the arid borderlands around the city of San Citlán. After an encounter with an outlaw in the village of Milpazul, the characters learn the source of the curse is a tlacatecolo—a shape-shifting fiend. Fearing for the folk under her protection, the outlaw directs the characters to the ghost town of Hollow and its abandoned mine, where she believes the creature lurks.

When the characters explore the mine, they find a connection to a humble home in the city of San Citlán, where they learn the tlacatecolo is controlling a troubled young man named [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md). Amid the celebration known as the Night of the Remembered, the characters must find [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), confront the evil within him, and destroy it if they can.

## Background

Twenty years ago in San Citlán, an ambitious sorcerer named Orencio made a bargain with the demon lord Pazuzu to gain magical power, a deal that resulted in the deaths of many of his peers. Months later, Orencio's partner, Rosa, found evidence of the profane oaths he had sworn, revealed his crimes, and witnessed his execution.

After his death, Orencio bargained with Pazuzu to avoid eternal suffering. The demon lord allowed Orencio to remain in his court and serve him in exchange for the soul of the sorcerer's firstborn child, to be taken when the child reached the age of twenty. The sorcerer agreed, believing he had no children. He didn't realize Rosa had borne him a son, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), a few months after his death.

As [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s twentieth birthday approaches, Pazuzu's power begins to consume the young man. While waiting for [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s final fall into corruption, the demon lord sent a faithful worshiper named Itzmin del Prado to watch over the youth. Itzmin works to convince [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) to accept Pazuzu's power in exchange for undoing the affliction that has transformed the young man into a fiend. [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) clings to his humanity, unaware of his part in Itzmin's plans to spread a curse across San Citlán.

### Pronunciation Guide

In Citlanés, the language spoken alongside Common in the region around San Citlán, vowels with an acute accent indicate stress on their syllable, the letter **ñ** sounds like the **ny** in **canyon**, **ch** is pronounced as in **charity**. The San Citlán Pronunciations table shows how to pronounce key names in this adventure.

### Setting the Adventure

San Citlán and its borderlands can appear in any setting. The following are suggestions for contextualizing the adventure in a wider world:

- **Through the Radiant Citadel.** Characters traveling from the Radiant Citadel arrive near the Ruisenor Peaks, a few hours travel from Milpazul. You can use the "San Citlán Gazetteer" section at the end of this adventure as a starting point to detail the region however you please.  
- **Eberron.** San Citlán might appear between the Blade Desert and Endworld Mountains in eastern Khorvaire, a location that might lead you to add more elves and dinosaurs into the mix, given the proximity of Valenar and the Talenta Plains.  
- **Forgotten Realms.** This adventure could easily be placed on the edge of Anauroch, potentially along either the Graycloak Hills or Desertmouth Mountains. The lands east of Tethyr or the mountainous reaches of Chessenta might also accommodate this rugged region.  

### Character Hooks

Consider the following suggestions to involve the characters in this adventure's plot:

- **The Dead Return.** The characters are heading to San Citlán to enjoy the food, parades, and celebrations of the Night of the Remembered (see the accompanying sidebar)—and perhaps to reconnect with a departed ancestor or loved one.  
- **Healing the Plague.** The characters have a friend of a friend who lives in the village of Milpazul. This acquaintance writes to them, asking for help investigating a wave of strange ailments and fiendish attacks plaguing her community.  

> [!note] Night of the Remembered
> 
> The end of this adventure takes place during a citywide celebration called the Night of the Remembered, when the deceased visit their loved ones. Establish the festival in advance if the characters don't already know about it. The adventure assumes that the characters take only a day or so to get from Milpazul to San Citlán. If you add more time, or if the characters need to take a long rest after the events in Milpazul or Hollow Mine, adjust the calendar accordingly. No matter what happens, the characters arrive in San Citlán while the festival is in full swing—it lasts as long as you require.
^night-of-the-remembered

## Starting the Adventure

![Ghouls drag a fresh victim...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/029-04-001.ghouls.webp#center "Ghouls drag a fresh victim into the depths of Hollow Mine")

The adventure begins just outside the village of Milpazul, a tiny community a few hours' journey from the city of San Citlán.

Once the players are ready, describe their characters' approach to the village. Read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Clouds rush overhead and dust swirls across the road to the village of Milpazul, which sits atop a hill overlooking a vast, semi-arid valley. The road ends at a wooden archway in a low, dry-stone wall that surrounds most of the settlement. As you near, a man on horseback spurs his mount and vanishes into the village.
^0f3

The characters approach Milpazul at the same time as a group of bounty hunters searching for the outlaw [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md). The man on horseback is the group's lookout; when he sees the characters, he assumes they're either a rival band of bounty hunters or [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)'s bandit allies. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 12 or higher notice a trail of dust rising from the opposite side of the village, suggesting a group entering the community.

### Ambush at the Archway

As the characters reach the archway entrance to the village, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score is the first to notice something is wrong:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Within the waist-high village wall, a dozen or so wood-and-adobe houses surround a well. A worn-out sign hangs crookedly from the arch, proclaiming in fading blue paint, "Welcome to Milpazul," but that welcome is contradicted by angry voices and cries of pain coming from behind a building.
^0f5

The bounty hunters have attacked several villagers who questioned their intentions. The other locals have retreated to their homes while several bounty hunter guards have set an ambush for anyone coming down the road, crouching low and hiding behind the wall near the archway.

A character who is looking for signs of trouble and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices villagers peering from their homes. A character who gets a 15 or higher on the check also hears movement behind the wall. As soon as the characters advance or attempt to fall back from the arch, the bounty hunters spring their ambush:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Seven figures spring up from behind the wall, aiming longbows at you.
> 
> "Clear out!" one of them shouts. "La [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) pays for her crimes this day!" Without hesitation, they attack.
^0f6

Seven bounty hunters (use the [scout](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) stat block) shoot from behind the waist-high wall, which grants them half cover against anyone attacking from the other side. They draw shortswords if the characters close for melee. If three of the bounty hunters fall, the survivors quickly retreat to their nearby [riding horses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md) and flee the village.

Characters can learn about [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) and the crimes of which she is accused from any defeated bounty hunters who survive the fight (see the "Learning about Paloma" section). One of the bounty hunters who dies or is captured during the fight carries a wanted poster depicting a stern old woman with the name "[Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)" below the portrait and offering a 500 gp reward for her capture.

## Welcome to Milpazul

Once the characters deal with the bounty hunters, a handful of locals thank the characters for their assistance and welcome them to Milpazul. Not everyone is enthused, though. Some villagers regard adventurers with distrust, fearing they'll bring more trouble.

### Entering the Village

As the characters progress into the village, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the distance, a slender figure tends to the wounded villagers, who respond with heartfelt gratitude. As the individual approaches, you realize they are more than simply thin—the figure is a skeleton clothed in a yellow-and-magenta dress, with many colorful bead necklaces hanging from the exposed vertebrae of their neck.
> 
> "You must be parched after that fight," they say. "How about some drinks, friends? On the house!"
^0f9

The name of the friendly skeleton is Rufina, and they own the village tavern. As thanks for dealing with the bounty hunters, Rufina invites the characters to the tavern for refreshments and rest, and happily helps acquaint the characters with the area.

#### Rufina

Formerly a human, Rufina is now an olvidado—a deceased person who remained behind after the Night of the Remembered. Rufina doesn't know how or why they don't pass on to the afterlife. Although beings like Rufina are uncommon in the region, they're not unheard of, and the skeleton is a well-liked member of the community. Rufina is neutral good and uses the [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block, but is Undead and doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Rufina has been sheltering [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) in the cellar of the tavern; after witnessing the characters' prowess, the olvidado wonders if the adventurers might be able to help her.

#### Learning about Paloma

While no one is willing to discuss [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)'s whereabouts, a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can gather the following information about the so-called outlaw from Rufina or the other villagers:

- [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) is seen as a hero by the poor. Her band raids the estates and caravans of corrupt landowners and shares the captured wealth with folk who need it.  
- She initially ran afoul of the law years ago when she was falsely accused of a crime.  
- [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) and her band were recently attacked by someone or something on the road. Most of the band were killed, but [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)'s body wasn't found.  

### Cursed Villagers

As they walk through the village, the characters notice many locals huddled in corners, bundled in blanket-like sarapes and trembling with cold despite it being a warm but cloudy day. If asked about them, Rufina replies that these unfortunates have caught sereno, an ailment seemingly spread by bitterly cold winds. Folk who have fallen ill speak of those winds blowing mostly at night, and Rufina warns the characters against staying out after dark. Although no one in Milpazul knows it, the sickness stems from the youth [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), who has transformed into a [tlacatecolo](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/tlacatecolo-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of this adventure) and hunts at night.

A character who examines a villager with sereno and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) or Wisdom ([Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check determines that sereno is not a disease but a curse.

#### Sereno

Sereno is a deadly magical affliction that inflicts a supernatural chill on its victims and eventually kills them. A creature cursed with sereno is [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), can't regain hit points, and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour, gaining 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) on a failed save. The creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it is in sunlight. Sereno can be undone by magic that ends poison or disease, like [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md), but only while the victim is in direct sunlight.

Sereno is inflicted by an insidious, shapeshifting fiend known as a [tlacatecolo](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/tlacatecolo-jttrc.md). If a tlacatecolo that afflicted one or more creatures with the curse dies, the curse ends for its victims. See the "Tlacatecolo" section at the end of this adventure for more details.

### Pulquería

The front wall of Rufina's tavern—called a *pulquería*, as it specializes in a local beverage called pulque—is plastered with portraits of missing persons and requests for help.

When the characters enter the tavern, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The pulquería's walls are painted with murals that depict a series of armed conflicts, with locals celebrating victory at the end. A candlelit altar behind the bar includes a painted portrait of an elderly woman, which is surrounded by yellow marigolds and offerings of drinks and cactus fruits.
> 
> Two dwarves seated at one of the three tables in the pulquería glance at you curiously.
^0ff

The dwarves are revolutionaries ([veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) who hang out in the tavern to protect [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md). They won't engage the characters unless [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) or Rufina is threatened.

Rufina offers the characters pulque, an alcoholic beverage made from fermented agave sap and the only drink Rufina remembers how to make. The olvidado also offers cactus, beans, and tortillas to any characters who are hungry and has a spare room if anyone needs to rest.

Characters who chat with Rufina learn the following:

- The mural was painted by Rufina and is an abstraction of San Citlán's history (detailed in the "San Citlán" section at the end of this adventure).  
- The altar behind the counter is an *ofrenda*, a memorial made to commune with the dead during the Night of the Remembered festivities, which begins in the coming days and will continue for several nights. This ofrenda is dedicated to Rufina's late daughter, Carmen.  

### Meeting Paloma

As conversation dies down, [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) emerges from a door leading to the cellar and approaches the characters. She is wrapped in a rebozo and suffers from sereno with 3 levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). If the characters threaten to take her for the bounty, the dwarf [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) rush to protect her, and Rufina warns the characters that not just the villagers, but the folk of the entire region, will turn against them if they proceed.

![Paloma](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/030-04-002.paloma.webp#center)

#### Paloma

[Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) (chaotic good, gnome [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) leads a band of revolutionaries in the borderlands around San Citlán. She was falsely accused of rustling, defended herself from the unjust arrest, and was charged with attempted murder as a result. She fled to the Indigo Desert and joined an outlaw band, quickly climbing the ranks to become the leader. While traveling across the region, [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) saw many injustices. She has recently allied with local revolutionaries opposing exploitation and corruption in the region, and she is already considered one of the revolutionaries' leaders.

##### Personality Trait

"I've seen much and have a story for every occasion."

##### Ideal

"I lost most of my life to others' corruption. I'll risk what I have left to bring an end to it."

##### Bond

"San Citlán is my home, and no one will ever drive me out of my own home."

##### Flaw

"I don't care who I endanger to further our cause."

#### Paloma's Request

[Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) explains to the characters that she needs the help of trustworthy adventurers to find the source of sereno and put an end to it. She goes on to share the following information:

- The sereno outbreak has killed many since it began a few months ago.  
- One night while [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) and three allies were traveling, trying to determine the source of the outbreak, a strange owl revealed itself to be a terrible fiend. They wounded the fiend, but it escaped.  
- Two of her companions died in the battle. The third—a druid named Lope—died of sereno soon after. Lope had been researching the curse and believed the fiend they saw was behind its spread.  
- Lope's research suggested killing the fiend will end the curse for all those suffering from sereno.  
- Scouts have seen owls and strange figures going in and out of a mine near the supposedly abandoned mining town of Hollow.  

#### The Hunt Begins

[Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) offers 100 gp per character for the party's assistance, and she gives them her [ring of jumping](Mechanics/items/ring-of-jumping.md) if they agree to investigate the mine and slay the fiend if they find it. She gives them directions to Hollow, an abandoned settlement about 14 miles away and 4 miles north of San Citlán. She warns against going at night, lest the characters suffer her fate.

#### Rumors of Hollow

If the characters ask around Milpazul about Hollow, they learn the information at the start of the "A Town Called Hollow" section. Additionally, a local overhears their inquiries and shares a chilling story:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I was riding by Hollow after dark, trying to get home, when I saw movement up by the old mine entrance. Two gaunt figures were dragging some poor soul into the mine—had it wrapped up tight. They looked like twin death, they did. I'll never forget their hissing and their slithering, horrid tongues. As a mercy, the body they were dragging looked like it was already dead. I rode on, I tell you. I didn't look back."
^109

## The Fiend's Identity

The fiend that [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)'s band is searching for is [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), a taciturn young man who lives in San Citlán with his mother, Doña Rosa. The son of the evil sorcerer Orencio, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) suffers from the corruption of the demon lord Pazuzu and has transformed into a [tlacatecolo](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/tlacatecolo-jttrc.md) (detailed at the end of the adventure). His fiendish nature compels him to spread his curse and feed on the afflicted. When he's himself, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is terrified and doesn't understand why he's changing. When he's overwhelmed by fiendish influence, he's ruled by the evil of his new form.

![Serapio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/031-04-003.serapio.webp#center)

### Family Matters

[Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s mother, Doña Rosa, is unaware of her son's transformation and believes he's in some trouble that he's hiding from her. She never told him about his biological father, Orencio. Years ago, Rosa lived among the San Citlánian elite, but after Orencio's execution, she fled the city to escape his followers. Starting a new life, Rosa married a man named Evaristo who helped raise [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md). Evaristo died three months ago from a sudden illness. In truth, Evaristo was the first victim of sereno. Soon after Evaristo died, when [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) showed signs of his own strange affliction, Rosa decided to return to San Citlán to confront her past. She believes the cult Orencio was involved with is somehow responsible, but she's found no evidence of this thus far.

### Pazuzu's Servant

When the wicked sorcerer Orencio was executed, his protégé, Itzmin, made his own pact with Pazuzu. Two decades later, Itzmin has become a corrupt politician in San Citlán who serves Pazuzu as Orencio did, using the demon lord's favor to secure economic and political power. Under Pazuzu's guidance, Itzmin has befriended [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), arranging for the young man to get part-time jobs for a produce distributor and an ironworks warehouse he owns. As [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) comes further under Pazuzu's control, Itzmin uses the youth's fiendish hunger to sow chaos in the borderlands.

## A Town Called Hollow

The mining town of Pontezuela once thrived at the southern extent of the mountains known as the Silver Veins. That changed when the silver ore for which the range was named ran dry. Folks started referring to the mine as "hollow" for its exhausted resources, and discovery of monstrous bones in its depths inspired talk of the site being cursed. Nowadays, "Hollow" is the only name most people call the settlement and its mine. Both were abandoned years ago, making the mine a perfect place for Itzmin and Pazuzu's faithful to hold their secret meetings.

### Traveling to Hollow Mine

The journey from Milpazul to Hollow takes just over half a day at a normal pace. If you want to highlight the dangers of the borderlands, add an encounter or two along the way. [Perytons](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/peryton.md) are common threats in the region, and [ettins](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) sometimes descend from the mountains to raid farmsteads.

#### Night Travel

If the characters ignore [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md)'s warning and travel at night, after a few hours of travel, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) sees them and flies overhead in his owl form. Though his mind is twisted by fiendish hunger, he is too wary to approach adventurers. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check sees sudden movement in the darkness overhead as a spotted owl silently circles the party and then flies away.

### Hollow

When characters approach Hollow, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A decrepit town spreads out along the road ahead, its weathered shacks creaking in the wind. A dozen or so armed figures move in and out of the structures, which appear long abandoned. An opulent coach, looking distinctly out of place, is parked amid the buildings with its curtains drawn.
^111

The road leading to the buildings is littered with items abandoned by the former residents. The armed figures are twelve [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) working for Itzmin, who has been buying property in the area to control access to the mine. The bandits won't allow the characters to access the mine without their boss's permission. If any characters ask questions or make trouble, the bandits point them to the carriage.

If the characters approach the impressive carriage, Itzmin emerges.

#### Itzmin

A spiteful tiefling in his late forties, Itzmin del Prado is a chaotic evil [cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md). He's also a politician and part of San Citlán's ruling council, the Trecena, where he serves as Councilor of Arms. The public gave him the moniker *Astaverde* (meaning "green horn") for his jadeite prosthetic horn.

Following the death of his mother, a celebrated military general, Itzmin squandered his family's fortune, and his family name became synonymous with disgrace. Desperate to regain his former glory, Itzmin sought the guidance of the cultist Orencio and forged his own pact with Pazuzu, offering his obedience in exchange for secrets that could be leveraged against San Citlán's elite.

##### Personality Trait

"I can't stand anyone treating me as their lesser."

##### Ideal

"I'll do whatever it takes to gain the upper hand in any situation."

##### Bond

"I must restore my family to its former glory."

##### Flaw

"I value prestige over security."

#### Itzmin's Goals

Itzmin wants to use [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s corruption to advance Pazuzu's wishes. And the more chaos reigns in the borderlands, the less organized the revolutionaries can be, which benefits Itzmin's political agenda. He's currently in Hollow to cover his tracks by razing the town, caving in the mine, and destroying any evidence of the rites that have taken place there.

#### Meeting Itzmin

Itzmin introduces himself as the owner of the mine and the township. He talks of hearing reports of a disease festering in town and says he plans to burn the abandoned houses to prevent it from spreading. He is dismissive of any suggestion that sereno isn't a disease. If the characters talk about entering the mine, Itzmin advises against it but doesn't stop them. If he is threatened in any way, he orders his bandits to attack and flees in his coach.

#### Cave-In!

At some point after the characters enter the mine, Itzmin's bandits detonate alchemical charges to collapse the entrance. Wherever the characters are in the mine, they hear a thunderous blast from above. If they return to mine's entrance, they find the cavern has collapsed, sealed by tons of impassable rubble. A character who is proficient with [alchemist's supplies](Mechanics/items/alchemists-supplies.md) or who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check confirms that the collapse was deliberate.

To escape, the characters must find the alternative exit in the depths of the mine.

## Hollow Mine

If the characters descend into the abandoned mine, they discover that it isn't empty and that the fiend they search for is at the center of a greater mystery.

### Hollow Mine Features

Hollow Mine has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Most ceilings are about 10 feet high, except for the ceiling in area H5.  
- **Light.** None of the mine's locations are lit unless otherwise indicated.  
- **Wailing Wind.** The structure of the mine and the elevation difference between its shafts funnels a strong wind through the tunnels. Gusts of air hiss and howl, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing.  

### Hollow Mine Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.1: Hollow Mine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/032-map-4.1-hollow-mine.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/033-map-4.1-hollow-mine-player.webp#gallery)

#### H1: Mine Entrance

Loose planks cover the entrance to the mine. Once characters enter the mine, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The mine's entrance leads into a large cavern supported by wooden beams. At the chamber's center, a derelict wooden elevator rattles in the wind that rushes from the depths of a crumbling mineshaft.
^11e

The stone of the mine entrance cavern is crumbling badly, but a character who has the Stonecunning trait or who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check can tell the cavern is in no immediate danger of collapsing. See the "Cave-In!" section for details on how that might change.

##### Elevator

The elevator is rusted in place, and the shaft it once traversed is depicted as shaded spaces on map 4.1. A character who examines it and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check recognizes that the elevator will collapse under any significant weight. If 100 pounds or more is placed on the elevator platform, it collapses. Any creature standing on the platform at the time drops 100 feet into area H5, taking 35 (`10d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

##### Hidden Entrance

The people of Hollow sealed a tunnel leading to the mine's lower levels on the northwest wall after a number of explorers got lost in the mine. With a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, a character perceives a section of the wall rattling in the wind, discovering a wooden door that was hidden behind a pile of rocks.

#### H2: Teocín's Quarters

A makeshift wooden door blocks the entrance to this chamber. Candlelight shines through the cracks. A character who listens at the door and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears growling beyond it.

##### Passwall Trap

A 5th-level [glyph of warding](Mechanics/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) holding a [passwall](Mechanics/spells/passwall.md) spell is inscribed on the floor in front of the door. Characters can spot the glyph with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. If someone opens the door while standing on the glyph, the glyph triggers and casts its spell on the floor around it, opening a pit into area H3. Each creature standing in the shaded spaces in front of the door on map 4.1 falls 30 feet into area H3 and takes 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage. The glyph's effects can be avoided by opening the door from a distance, which prevents the spell from being triggered.

Once the characters can see into this area, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this chamber is slick with blood. Two of three tables have growling corpses strapped to them. A frenzied woman brandishes a knife as she undoes the straps.
^123

This chamber is the workspace of Teocín, a [cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) dedicated to Pazuzu. As soon as the characters enter, Teocín releases the two [ghouls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) on the tables and joins them as they attack.

##### Teocín

The cultist Teocín uses this laboratory to research ways to corrupt the magic of the Night of the Remembered. Itzmin has convinced [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) that Teocín is trying to find a cure for him, so the young man leaves her alone. For months, Teocín's ghouls have killed animals, hunters, prospectors, and others wandering the borderlands so Teocín can study and raise the dead using profane knowledge she gleans from unholy rites.

If Teocín is captured, she says nothing to the characters, but they can learn of her goals, Orencio, and Pazuzu by looking through her notes—dozens of filthy, scrawl-covered pages strewn about the room.

##### Treasure

Teocín keeps the belongings of her victims in a chest: 2,500 cp, 950 sp, and jewelry and other trinkets worth 90 gp. She also wears a [periapt of health](Mechanics/items/periapt-of-health.md) to avoid the threat of disease that comes from working with the dead.

#### H3: Corpse Disposal

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The stench here is horrendous. Hundreds of humanoid and animal bones fill the chamber in charnel heaps.
^127

Teocín uses this chamber to dispose of her failed experiments. Two [ochre jellies](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) feed on the remains and are dissolving meals deep under piles of bones. They emerge, oozing up through the bones, as soon as they sense movement.

If the mine entrance has not yet collapsed and all the characters are in or near this room, Itzmin detonates his charges (see the "Cave-In!" section earlier in the adventure).

#### H4: Serapio's Quarters

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Damaged furniture has been dragged into this area to create a study. Two bookshelves stand alongside chairs and a desk covered with papers. The rough cave walls feature gouges, as if some powerful creature dragged its claws across the stone.
^129

Itzmin set up these living quarters for [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), hoping to entice him away from his mother and make the mine feel homier. [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is not present when the characters arrive but often isolates himself here to hide his monstrous shape. Silence and isolation calm him, as does his hobby of sketching. When the corruption becomes too much, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) scratches the walls with his fiendish talons.

##### Makeshift Library

The bookshelves hold a mix of fiction, histories, and more. A character who scans the shelves and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a [spell scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md) and a book containing rituals for the [alarm](Mechanics/spells/alarm.md), [find familiar](Mechanics/spells/find-familiar.md), and [illusory script](Mechanics/spells/illusory-script.md) spells.

##### Drawing Desk

Nubs of charcoal and drawings are scattered across the desk. The sketches range from mundane portraits and cityscapes to ghastly renditions of demonic faces with saucer-sized eyes. Any character who knows San Citlán recognizes the cityscape drawings as depicting features from San Citlán's Los Gavilanes district, the city's old town. If the characters don't know the city, a number of the drawings have the legend "Los Gavilanes" on them.

Characters looking through the drawings spot two things of note:

- One sketch depicts an elegantly dressed tiefling, whom the characters recognize as Itzmin if they met him outside.  
- Numerous cityscapes show a distinctive vecindad, one of the manor houses converted into apartments that are common in Los Gavilanes. Many of these sketches bear the caption "Home" written in a shaky hand. This is the vecindad of Doña Rosa.  

##### Hidden Locket

A character searching the desk's otherwise empty drawers finds half of a hinged silver locket wrapped in paper. The locket contains a tiny pencil portrait of a warmly smiling woman. The characters likely have no way of knowing it yet, but this is [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s mother, Doña Rosa. The other half of the locket is in [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s room in San Citlán.

#### H5: Wailing Cavern

The wailing wind that gusts intermittently through the mine rises to a continuous howl in this cavern. The elevator shaft in area H1 ends in this cavern's ceiling, and the elevator cage might have crashed to the floor below if the characters tried to use it.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This sizable cavern's ceiling is thirty feet high, and strange symbols are scrawled across its walls. The skeletons of two huge creatures are here, one embedded in the east wall and the other coiled around an altar covered in filthy feathers.
^12e

Itzmin uses this cavern as a secret space to worship Pazuzu, performing rites that would draw attention in San Citlán.

##### Demonic Scrawls

The symbols scrawled across the walls are in Abyssal and represent omens and prophecies sent by Pazuzu to Itzmin. A character who understands Abyssal or succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check gleans that an innocent creature is being twisted into an envoy of Pazuzu and is spreading corruption through the region.

##### Dinosaur Skeletons

These giant skeletons were unearthed shortly before the silver in the mine ran out, inspiring talk that the mine was cursed. When Teocín first joined Itzmin here, she drew on the power of Pazuzu to turn these skeletons into guardians.

If a character approaches within 10 feet of the altar, the two [skeletons](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/dinosaur-skeleton-jttrc.md) animate and attack. They both use the [allosaurus](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/allosaurus.md) stat block, with these changes:

- They are Undead.  
- They are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, immune to poison damage, and immune to [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) and the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.  
- They have [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.  

#### H6: Tunnel to San Citlán

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Eerie scrawls cover the walls of this long, straight tunnel. A breeze flows from that darkness, carrying a faint scent of smoke. Foul-looking feathers litter the floor, and claw marks gouge the stone walls.
^132

This ancient tunnel runs south toward San Citlán. Itzmin, Teocín, and [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) travel this passage from the city to the mine without attracting attention. After the demolition of area H1, this tunnel is the characters' only escape route from the mine.

The feathers here are unnatural, and any character who has proficiency in the [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion) skill can tell they are from a fiendish creature. The claw marks match the marks in area H4. A character who can automatically sense direction or who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check knows the tunnel leads south toward San Citlán.

#### Dry Cenote

The tunnel leads the characters to a dry cenote in the district of Los Gavilanes within San Citlán. The cenote was mined when the city was first established, but these mines were abandoned centuries ago, leaving old scaffolding that can be used to climb approximately 100 feet to the surface.

Impoverished citizens dwell amid the scaffolding. They're surprised to see strangers emerge from the depths but don't bother the characters. If questioned about anything strange they might have seen, these locals prove tight-lipped. Should a character succeed on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or offer at least 1 sp in exchange for information, someone admits having seen a strange spotted owl flying in and out of the cenote at night.

## Night of the Remembered

Emerging from the cenote, the characters find themselves in San Citlán in the midst of the Night of the Remembered celebrations. The characters can make their way through the city without incident, but the festivities are unignorable.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Colorful flowers and paper decorations hang between buildings, and delicious scents waft from the food stalls at every street corner. Locals wearing elaborate masks and costumes celebrate in the streets. Well-dressed skeletons walk alongside pompous-looking business barons, and mischievous children in devil costumes poke at onlookers with toy tridents.
^135

A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History) or [Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows the costumes represent La Catrina, patron spirit of the city; Don Roque, a long-dead politician who became the satirical face of the government; and Los Diablitos, comical renditions of fiends from local fables.

![The living and the dead ce...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/034-04-004.night-of-the-remembered.webp#center "The living and the dead celebrate the Night of the Remembered in San Citlán")

### The Fiend's Trail

While the characters explored Hollow Mine, a desperate [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) watched the preparations for the Night of the Remembered in San Citlán. Overcome by guilt, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) managed to fight back his fiendish urges long enough to resume his human form. He confessed to his mother, then fled his home as he felt himself transforming again. For the better part of the day since, he has flown around in spotted owl form, trying to decide what path to take.

The characters can learn about his plight at Doña Rosa's vecindad, which they might find in multiple ways:

- A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 12 or higher notices folk on the street pointing at the sky. If asked, the people say an owl has been flying over the district during daylight—a strange portent on the Night of the Remembered. The characters can determine the owl's course by succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, which leads them to Doña Rosa's feather-littered vecindad.  
- A character can show the locket containing Doña Rosa's portrait to passersby. If they do so and succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character finds a local or recognizes the picture and provides directions to Doña Rosa's home.  
- If the characters kept [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s cityscape drawings, they can use it to find the vecindad with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.  

As the characters near the vecindad, folk on the street can direct the party toward the old manor house if the characters show them [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s sketches. If the characters found the half-locket in area H4 of Hollow Mine, they can use a [locate object](Mechanics/spells/locate-object.md) spell to find the other half of the locket once they are within 1,000 feet of the vecindad.

### Doña Rosa's Vecindad

The old manor house stands on a quiet street. Read the following to set the scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This large manor shows its age, but the building is well cared for and, like the rest of the city, cheerfully decorated for the impending festival.
> 
> A colorful altar stands opposite the entrance, its tiers covered with sketched portraits. You hear sobbing coming from one of the apartments.
^138

Most of the folk in the vecindad are celebrating, but Doña Rosa weeps alone in her apartment. Unless the characters attempt to sneak in, Doña Rosa hears them approach and opens the door.

Characters who saw [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s locket identify Doña Rosa as the woman in the portrait. If the characters are armed, she faces them defiantly, asking, "Are you here to kill my son?" The group's answer determines how she engages with them.

#### Doña Rosa

If the characters describe the creature they're looking for, Doña Rosa (neutral good, human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) invites them into her home and tells them there is much they don't know about this fiend. Use the following information to guide the conversation:

- The creature the characters hunt is named [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md). He is Doña Rosa's son, not a monster.  
- She had thought [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) was ill, but he confessed his secret earlier that day and fled.  
- [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s father, Orencio, was a sorcerer who consorted with demons. He was executed years ago after Doña Rosa exposed his deeds.  
- Doña Rosa believes Orencio or the cult he served is responsible for [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s curse.  
- She can share any of the details from the "Family Matters" section earlier in the adventure.  

##### A Mother's Request

Doña Rosa asks the characters to spare [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) and bring him to her, promising to look after him until she can find him help. She doesn't know where he has gone, though.

If the characters name or describe Itzmin, Rosa knows him as [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s employer. She doesn't trust him, as his friendliness rings false.

If the characters don't agree (or if they insist on killing the fiend), Doña Rosa orders them to leave. Learning more from her requires effective roleplaying to win her over, as well as a successful DC 13 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

#### Inside the Apartment

Doña Rosa's tiny apartment consists of a living room and a bedroom.

##### Living Room

A corner of the living room features an ofrenda with the portrait of a stern-looking man on top. If asked, Rosa identifies the man as her late husband and [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s stepfather, Evaristo. If a character treats her kindly or succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, Rosa says that Evaristo died of an affliction the characters recognize as sereno, and that [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) confessed to being inadvertently responsible.

##### Bedroom

The bedroom is split by a wooden screen with bedrolls on each side. The walls on [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s side are lined with drawings. The other half of his locket hangs on the wall near his bedroll. This is the top half, and no picture is inside.

#### Offerings for the Dead

After the characters speak with Doña Rosa, they see other residents of the vecindad pausing to decorate or say short prayers at the communal altar. These locals politely invite characters to help them.

##### Setting an Ofrenda

The shared altar has enough space for each character to set a small ofrenda. Locals guide them through the process:

- The altar must be decorated properly with candles and yellow marigolds (provided by the locals).  
- While it is customary to have a portrait of the deceased on the ofrenda, it's not a requirement.  
- Offerings might include any kind of food and drink that the deceased enjoyed in life or small curios.  

A character who sets an ofrenda communes with the soul they're honoring and receives the Guidance of the Remembered charm.

##### Guidance of the Remembered

A deceased ancestor or loved one provides you with guidance, granting you insight via a "charm" (a type of supernatural gift detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). You can cast [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) during a long rest to contact the spirit of a friend or family member without that spirit's corpse. The spirit's answers to your questions manifest as whispers only you can hear. The charm does not function if the spirit you try to contact is Undead or was the target of [speak with dead](Mechanics/spells/speak-with-dead.md) within the last 10 days. Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.

![Altar with Ofrendas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/035-04-005.altar-with-ofrendas.webp#center)

#### Itzmin's Mission

While the characters speak with his mother, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) meets with Itzmin at a metalworks Itzmin owns and recounts his confession to his mother. Itzmin reassures the youth that after he attends to some business, they can return to Hollow Mine. That unnamed business is the murder of Doña Rosa, whom Itzmin believes knows too much.

If Itzmin died or was captured in Hollow, one of his [cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) protégés meets [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) in the warehouse and takes Itzmin's place in the following chase. The characters might recognize the protégé from [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s drawings, or Doña Rosa can identify them as one of Itzmin's people.

As the characters leave the vecindad, they spot Itzmin or his replacement approaching. As soon as he notices the characters, he flees.

### Parade Chase

Itzmin tries to lose the characters by running into a crowd celebrating the Night of the Remembered—ultimately headed for the metalworks where [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) hides. However, the characters can give chase.

After rolling initiative, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. Itzmin begins 120 feet ahead of the pursuers. Track the distance between Itzmin and the pursuers, and designate the pursuer closest to them as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.

#### Dashing

During the chase, a participant can freely use the [Dash](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dash) action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional [Dash](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Dash) action it takes requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). A participant drops out of the chase if its [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.

#### Spells and Attacks

A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to these actions. Chase participants can't normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time.

#### Chase Complications

Complications occur randomly during the chase. Each participant rolls on the Parade Chase Complications table at the end of its turn. If a complication occurs, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend "inspiration" to negate the complication.

**Parade Chase Complications**

`dice: [](05-the-fiend-of-hollow-mine.md#^parade-chase-complications)`

| dice: d10 | Complication |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | A 20-foot-tall, papier mâché skeleton puppet walks across the street. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being stepped on. On a failed check, you take 5 (`2d4`) bludgeoning damage and fall [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). |
| 2 | Fireworks go off nearby. Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by smoke until the end of your turn. While [blinded](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Blinded), your speed is halved. |
| 3 | Centaur acrobats are performing in your path. Make a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. On a success, they lift you from the waist and speed you forward 30 feet. On a failed check, you fall [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone). |
| 4 | Peaceful spectral dancers fill the street. Make a DC 15 Charisma ([Performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance)) check to flow with their movements. On a failed check, they impede your sight and count as 10 feet of "difficult terrain". |
| 5 | A religious procession blocks your way. Make a DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check to recognize their customs and move respectfully among them. On a success, a thankful cleric casts [bless](Mechanics/spells/bless.md) on you. On a failed check, they cast [bane](Mechanics/spells/bane.md) instead (save DC 14). |
| 6–10 | No complication |
^parade-chase-complications

#### Ending the Chase

The chase ends when either side gives up the chase, when Itzmin escapes, or when the pursuers are close enough to catch Itzmin. If neither side gives up the chase, Itzmin makes a Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The chase's crowded surroundings give Itzmin advantage on this check. If the lead pursuer has proficiency in [Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival), Itzmin loses advantage. The check's result is compared to the passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) scores of the pursuers.

If Itzmin is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of Itzmin's check is greater than the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score, he escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round.

If the characters catch Itzmin, he tells them where [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is in exchange for his release. Should Itzmin escape, the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score sees a spotted owl ([Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) in his owl form) overhead, watching Itzmin. They can follow the owl to the metalworks.

### Metalworks Confrontation

The metalworks looks abandoned, and no employees are on site. Map 4.2 represents the structure. A double door is barred from inside, but Itzmin left a smaller door unlocked. When the characters enter, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The warehouse measures about sixty feet by ninety feet and features a raised catwalk along two sides, accessible by ladders. Two fifteen-foot-diameter containers are suspended over the warehouse floor by chains, which run up and through a winch before descending to a mechanical control console atop the catwalk. Two doors near the console lead to other rooms.
^148

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.2: Abandoned Metalworks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/036-map-4.2-abandoned-metalworks.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/JttRC/037-map-4.2-abandoned-metalworks-player.webp#gallery)

#### Scrap Piles

These large piles of scrap metal await separating and sorting and are "difficult terrain". A character who studies or moves over a pile can see it contains mostly iron and a few scraps of low-quality silver (not enough to be valuable without hours of sorting).

#### Hanging Containers

The two huge suspended containers each contain more iron and silver scrap. A console on the catwalk controls both containers. A creature adjacent to the console can spend an action to throw a lever and tip either of the containers. If a container is tipped, the scrap metal within falls to the floor, dealing 14 (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage to any creature below it.

#### Offices

The two unlocked offices on the catwalk contain rough furniture, years-old business records, and mundane tools. If Itzmin reaches the warehouse, he ascends to the catwalk and hides in one of the offices, emerging and trying to escape only after he hears combat.

#### Facing Serapio

When the characters arrive, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) the [tlacatecolo](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/tlacatecolo-jttrc.md) (see the end of this adventure) is lurking on the catwalk. If Itzmin has been dealt with, the young man is struggling with his fiendish form, overcome by fear and rocking back and forth. If Itzmin reached the warehouse before the characters, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is expecting danger and is ready to attack.

##### Talking Things Through

Trying to calm [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) enough to talk to him requires convincing roleplaying and a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If a character succeeds on this check before battle begins, [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) temporarily overcomes the demonic influence afflicting him and reverts to his natural form, that of a human. He maintains this form for 1 minute, during which he begs the characters to find a way to end the curse afflicting him. After doing so, he transforms back into a tlacatecolo and attacks.

If [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) attacks the characters before they can speak with him, a character can use an action to try to calm [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) by making a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Succeeding on this check once causes [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) to hesitate, but he keeps attacking. Succeeding twice causes [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) to regain control and transform back into a human (as noted above).

If [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) throws off the demonic influence, and the characters attack or threaten him in any way, the fiend takes control of him again, causing him to transform back into a tlacatecolo and attack. [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) can't be talked into transforming back into a human more than once.

##### Advantage and Disadvantage

If a character shows [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) part of his locket, the young man's determination to fight the fiendish influence is bolstered, giving the characters advantage on checks made to convince him to stand down. If Itzmin is there, he goads [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) to attack, giving the characters disadvantage.

#### Fighting the Fiend

While [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is in his tlacatecolo form, he tries to remain airborne.

A character who has a passive Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) score of 13 or higher can tell that the tlacatecolo's control of [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is not absolute and deduces that magic might disrupt that control. If [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is targeted by a [lesser restoration](Mechanics/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or [remove curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell, the tlacatecolo is forced to leave his body for 5 minutes. During this time, the [tlacatecolo](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/tlacatecolo-jttrc.md) becomes a separate entity that continues fighting. [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) uses the [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block and keeps out of battle.

If the tlacatecolo is reduced to 0 hit points while separated from [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md), it is destroyed, freeing [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md). If the tlacatecolo is slain while it's still in [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md)'s body, his body retains its monstrous appearance as both the fiend and [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) die.

## Conclusion

If the characters bring [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) to Doña Rosa alive, she weeps with gratitude and thanks them profusely. If [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is still under fiendish control, Doña Rosa seeks aid from the archmages of the Argent Congregation—the local academy of magic-users—who are able to put an end to his affliction and so end the curse on all victims of sereno.

If [Serapio](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/serapio-jttrc.md) is slain while under fiendish control, the characters hear a blood-curdling scream as his soul is dragged into the Abyss. All the victims of sereno are immediately freed from the curse, but Doña Rosa falls into despair and refuses to speak to the characters again.

When the fiend is defeated, [Paloma](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/paloma-jttrc.md) grants the characters their promised reward when they return to Milpazul. She also invites them to join her outlaw gang. The villagers freed from sereno's effects also express their gratitude to the characters.

## San Citlán Gazetteer

The stone-and-iron city of San Citlán stands at a confluence of ley lines, where the veil between the worlds of the living and the dead is thin. It's a place suffused with magic, where citizens commune with the dead in joyful festivals, and industrious minds create wonders of magic and technology. Despite San Citlán's rich culture and magical marvels, economic inequality is stark between the majority of its inhabitants and the wealthy landowners and technocrats who control the land's resources. These elite reap the rewards of progress with little regard for those left behind. As harsh as life can be for those in the city, the borderlands are harsher still. There, every day is a struggle to survive in the face of poverty, banditry, and drought.

A cosmopolitan trade hub, San Citlán is home to grand plazas, vibrant markets, and countless neighborhoods competing for space against towering industrial facilities. Smokestacks rise over cobbled streets. Silence is a commodity, as hammers ring out and forge fires roar in the city's ironworks at all hours.

Discontent among the common people has given rise to revolutionaries in the borderlands who are determined to fight the Trecena—the city's ruling council—to bring an end to corruption. Outrage recently reached a fever pitch as the city reels from political instability wrought by the death of a high-profile politician, Doña Estela. She was the longest-serving member of the Trecena, and rumors that magical resurrection will restore her to rule indefinitely have shattered the government's democratic facade. Discord brews among members of the Trecena, some of whom support Doña Estela's return while others vie for her coveted station.

### Features

### Noteworthy Sites

San Citlán is a land of contrasts. Lavish mansions cradle the wealthy while the poor scrape to survive. Purses are filled in lively markets and emptied in cantinas and wrestling rings. Massive industrial complexes loom over colorful homes in quaint streets and alleys.

#### Papalotlán Hill

This verdant hill at the heart of the city is the center of power and wealth. Councilors of the Trecena try to maintain order from the towers of the Crucible Court, the city's seat of government. Within the enchanted halls of the Argent Congregation, the minds behind San Citlán's progress prepare future generations of spellcasting adepts. The base of the hill teems with monuments, temples, and extravagant estates. These wealthy neighborhoods and aristocratic circles provide the backdrop for political and social intrigue.

#### Marfil Ironworks

The city's primary source of wealth is the industrial collective known as Marfil Ironworks, which processes local minerals using a mix of innovative technology and magic. The ironworks have many complexes across the city, and these labyrinthine facilities house all kinds of wondrous experimental creations.

#### Los Gavilanes

Los Gavilanes is the informal name given to San Citlán's old town. It's the most populous district, where ancient manors turned into collective living quarters are rented to industrial workers and their families. These buildings, known as *vecindades*, each house dozens of tenants and abide by complex internal community structures.

#### The Borderlands and Milpazul

The dry, rocky landscape outside San Citlán offers little in the way of comfort. Over half the city's workers live in these borderlands, while many more folk labor at mines and farms in the area. These communities have suffered neglect that has led to increased banditry on top of the usual attacks by monsters. One of the largest borderlands settlements, Milpazul, caters to travelers looking for shelter. It has acquired a reputation as a hub for mercenaries, as locals turn to *caporales—*traditional defenders on horseback—for security in the absence of city support.

### Life in San Citlán

Molded through generations of cosmopolitan mingling, San Citlán's culture is ever-evolving but not without honored traditions.

#### Food and Recreation

Food is a particular point of pride in San Citlán, whose peoples use it to express their heritage. Local ingredients include agave, beans, cactus, chili peppers, maize, and tomatillos. These are combined with many imported goods to create dishes from painstakingly prepared stews such as hominy-and-meat pozole to ubiquitous snacks like tacos.

For city folk, many recreations relieve the pressures of daily life. Along with music and dance, ball games are a common pastime, ranging from ancient variations played with the hip to more contemporary kicking games. Wrestling evolved into its own form of theatrical entertainment: La Lucha, where luchadores don colorful masks, adopt epic personas, and battle using acrobatic maneuvers.

#### Faith and Festivals

Worship is ingrained in city culture, and major religions have temples ranging from grandiose to quaint. "Don't piss outside the cantina lest you soil a temple" is a local saying that both offers etiquette advice and references the city's many centers of worship. La Catrina—believed to be death herself—is the patron spirit of the city. She is a capricious figure who wishes to be celebrated rather than feared.

While numerous festivals are held throughout the year, the most splendid and anticipated is the Night of the Remembered, a celebration that evolved from ancient funerary rites and draws on the magic of the city. During this night, people can be visited by deceased loved ones if they honor them with an ofrenda: food and drink enjoyed in life, among other traditional offerings, presented on elaborate altars that guide souls back to the world. The days leading up to this event are marked by colorful citywide parades that display San Citlán's diverse culture.

#### Olvidados

In rare circumstances, the deceased remain in San Citlán as Undead following the Night of the Remembered. Known as *olvidados*, or "forgotten," these intelligent Undead often take the form of sapient, peaceful skeletons or spirits. Most retain the memories and personality they had in life, but they have no recollection of the afterlife.

#### Governance and Growth

San Citlán is governed by the Trecena, a council consisting of thirteen elected representatives. The ability to vote for these representatives is limited to landowners and their descendants, those who serve in the military, graduates of the Argent Congregation, and those who make a considerable contribution to the city's economy.

In recent decades, the city has undergone significant transformations marked by great discoveries attributed to the Argent Congregation. Doña Estela, a dwarf landowner who held a seat in the Trecena for more than fifty years, was the congregation's founder and is credited with San Citlán's economic rise. However, her focus on progress and city aesthetics has drawn heavy criticism, as the majority of the populace lives in poverty. The seat of Councilor of the Foundry remains vacant following Doña Estela's recent death, as it has become clear that the oligarch intended to be resurrected to continue her rule indefinitely.

#### Names

Those native to San Citlán often have up to three names: a given name and two family surnames, inherited from their parents. The following are common names in San Citlán:

- **Feminine.** Citlali, Estela, Guadalupe, María, Quintina, Xóchitl  
- **Masculine.** Alejo, Cuauhtémoc, Eladio, Fortino, Pedro, Tenoch  
- **Gender-Neutral.** Azul, Centli, Cruz, Izel, Paz, Quetzal  
- **Surnames.** Apanco, Caloch, Infante, Moreno, Salazar, Xicoténcatl  

### Legends of San Citlán

According to the tale of San Citlán's founding, an explorer named Citlali became lost in the valley of the Calaveras River. After wandering for days, Citlali saw an elegantly dressed skeletal figure trailing behind her, never moving too close or straying too far. She tried to flee, but the figure always caught up. When she turned and followed her pursuer instead, the skeleton led Citlali to a hidden cenote. Citlali dove in to assuage her thirst, and when she resurfaced, the skeletal figure was gone.

Observing that the area was rich in precious minerals, Citlali returned home and convinced others to join her to settle the valley north of the cenote and the mountains now known as Citlali's Rest. Citlali grew old, and the skeletal figure returned to take her, but the settlement remained. It was named in her honor, with Citlán roughly translating to "the place near Citlali." People began calling the skeletal figure La Catrina for her elegant clothing.

San Citlán's history is rife with conflict. After years of failed invasions over its first century of existence, the city was overcome and occupied by a colonizing force. Colonial rule lasted for two hundred years and ended in a bloody series of conflicts called the Wars of Separation. In the aftermath, the folk of San Citlán held their first elections, finally looking forward to a time of peace. The wars have left scars, turning previously fertile lands barren and driving away the fey that once inhabited the region—some say forever.

### Characters from San Citlán

If players want to create characters from San Citlán, consider asking them the following questions during character creation:

**Where do you stand in society?** San Citlán's economic inequality shapes the lives of its people. Are you one of the privileged or one of the destitute? If you're privileged, do you have a vote? If destitute, do you live in or outside the city?

**Whom do you honor with your ofrenda?** Most in San Citlán eagerly look forward to the Night of the Remembered so they can commune with their loved ones. Do you? What does your ofrenda look like, and who is it for?

**Does tradition color how you adventure?** Are you familiar with the ways of an adventuring caporal or lifestyles that give you a close connection to your steed and the open road? Do you have experience as a larger-than-life luchador wrestler—maybe even wearing a signature mask?

## Tlacatecolo

Appearing as plague-stricken, bipedal owls, tlacatecolo sow sickness and feed on the suffering of mortals. These fiends spread an affliction that leaches heat and life from the living, dispersing it upon winds that rattle like a gasp from a frozen body. Sunlight staves off the disease, but those affected rarely survive the dark of night.
