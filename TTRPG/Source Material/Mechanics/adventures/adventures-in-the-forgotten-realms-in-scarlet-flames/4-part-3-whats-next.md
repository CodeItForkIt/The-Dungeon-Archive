# Part 3: What's Next?
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: In Scarlet Flames, p. 12* 

The adventurers may have treasure to sell and lore to lend, or questions in mind and wounds to tend. The aftermath of this adventure is a bundle of questions, so focus on the characters and what they want to do next, perhaps with downtime activities. If they want to chase down Tyreus and Morwena, that trail might simply go cold—for now. Their threads reappear in the next adventure: The Hidden Page.

## The Barrow Wizards

Gifting or selling the library's remains, and any other treasures, might occupy the adventurers until the next adventure. The barrow, or what's left of it, might be of interest to sages—or the adventurers might keep it for themselves.

Investigations into the identities and fates of the barrow wizards doesn't reveal tremendous secrets but neither does it yield many answers. The following items of lore are important for the next adventure, but much about those old wizards is left for you to decide, customize, or leave in mystery.

- The leader of the barrow wizards' sect was a traveler from "a faraway place" or "a distant world."  
- She came to the Sword Coast "looking for answers" and to "study the magic of the Realms." Her followers were scholarly wizards.  
- She lived in a townhouse in Waterdeep sometimes, but left it walled up when she returned to her homeland. The sect fell apart without her.  

### Teleportation Circles

The teleportation circles in the library led to places helpful for the wizards' sect. One led to the attic of the master's boarded-up, derelict townhouse. The other is damaged and presumably not working—or you can use it to plug into your campaign elsewhere.

## The Missing Villains

Tyreus and Morwena magically transported to one of Tyreus's hidden sanctums. Tyreus got what he wanted from the barrow: a tome of magic with a hidden key inside. For now, he and Morwena are working on their magic, getting to know one another, and planning their next moves. The adventurers haven't seen the last of them yet.
