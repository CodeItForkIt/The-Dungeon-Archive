## Chapter 4–Into the Outlands

While Shemeshka investigates the characters' origins and the strange magic affecting the adventurers, the party travels to the Outlands in search of a fugitive modron. Their trail leads to a mysterious castle with the ability to traverse the plane. The magical fortress has recently been occupied by Fiends, which prove to be an impediment to investigating the site, learning more about the missing modron, and exploring the Outlands beyond.

![The walking castle Iedcaru...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/018-02-001.splash.webp#center "The walking castle Iedcaru endlessly explores the Outlands")

### Arrival in the Outlands

When the characters emerge from the portal, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You find yourself standing amid ruins of weathered black marble. The last recognizable remnant of these ruins, a solitary stone archway, provides a frame for the portal you just passed through. Glittering, deep-blue sand spreads before you in all directions. Great impact divots mark the passage of something enormous. The trail leads toward a sudden transition in the terrain, where a forest of magenta trees climbs craggy hills that look like wizened faces.
> 
> Much farther in the distance, an impossibly tall stone spire stretches from the horizon into the clouds.
^0a3

The portal from Sigil opens into a nameless ruin in the Outlands that is roughly halfway between the Spire and the gate-town of Torch. The portal, which leads back to Sigil, can be reopened with a piece of lapis lazuli etched with an eye. The surreal nature of the surrounding desert, forest, and hills, as well as the rapid transition between the terrains, is natural for the Outlands.

Creatures can follow the tracks toward the forest. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check knows the tracks weren't made by an animal, but rather by a large magical device or machine.

A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes the stone spire in the distance as the Spire that marks the center of the Outlands and atop which floats Sigil.

Characters who follow the trail find a walking castle (see the following section) after an hour of travel. Those who avoid the trail come across the castle in another direction.

> [!quote] A quote from The Mosaic Mimir

> "I am a mimir, a magical device designed to provide information. I can be, be, be–" *Cacophonous gibberish and overlapping voices ensue.* "Infinite unlikelihood error: data not found."

### The Walking Castle

The walking castle Iedcaru is a treasure from ages past. It was created by githzerai as a hermitage where ascetics could travel the Outlands and meditate on the nature of realms beyond. While the castle has been forgotten by most githzerai scholars in Limbo, it remains the home of [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md), a sage who seeks to glean multiversal truths from mystical planar forces.

Iedcaru has recently seen more visitors than usual. The first was the modron [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), which stopped at the castle and learned much about the Outlands. More recently, though, a host of Fiends discovered and occupied the castle. They've captured [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) and are now working to discover how to operate the castle. The Fiends' goals are up to you; they could be seeking to claim the castle and sell it as a war machine, or they might be working for Shemeshka through intermediaries seeking to track [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md).

When the characters come within sight of the walking castle, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Amid a grove of strange trees stands an ornate tower. Around it, toppled pillars lie scattered. A short stairway rises from the ground to a stone terrace, where six openings lead into the structure.
^0a5

The walking castle is currently immobile. Those who climb the stairs reach area W1.

#### Walking Castle Features

The castle has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings in the castle are 30 feet high on the first floor and 15 feet high on other floors.  
- **Doors.** Doors in the castle are stone reinforced with iron. The doors have AC 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. They can be broken open as an action with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. Locked doors can be picked as an action with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.  
- **Light.** Crystals embedded on the interior walls and ceilings of the castle fill rooms with bright light.  
- **Water.** Taps in the kitchen, washroom, and workshop provide endless streams of fresh water.  

### Walking Castle Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1. The compass on the map and directions in the following descriptions are provided for ease of use.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.1: Walking Castle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/019-map-2.01-walking-castle.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/020-map-2.01-walking-castle-player.webp#gallery)

#### W1: Terrace

A paved ring with a 2-foot-high lip provides a foundation for the castle. The base of the tower opens into a hall without exterior doors. Along the west and east interior walls of this hall are doors that lead to area W2. The door to the east is locked. The door to the west has been shattered inward.

A character who walks around the tower and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the perch and door to area W4c, 30 feet above.

#### W2: Library

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> All manner of tomes, scrolls, tablets, and folios cram the towering shelves of this airy library. An ancient wooden table surrounded by matching benches stands at the room's center, near an ornate spiral staircase that climbs through the ceiling above. To the north are statues of githzerai scholars and an alcove with a table covered in candles. To the south, in another alcove, stands a crystal sarcophagus.
^0aa

The library holds the collected writings of Iedcaru's scholars. The majority focus on esoteric philosophies of the Outer Planes and multiversal theories.

The spiral stairs rise to area W3.

##### Research Collection

A character who spends 1 hour researching the Outer Planes here can make an Intelligence check with advantage, obtaining the knowledge sought with a successful check.

##### North Alcove

This alcove holds two braziers, a threadbare mat, and a table covered in candles and used incense sticks.

##### Sarcophagus

Visible through the transparent lid of this sarcophagus is the mummified body of Iedcaru's first caretaker, the githzerai scholar Laxuelu, whose name is etched on the lid. The mummy has brass eyes, and its sarcophagus can't be opened. Whenever a creature in the library speaks its desire for a text on a particular topic, the mummy's eyes magically move to look in the direction of a relevant work in the collection (if it exists).

##### Treasure

Among the candles in the alcove sits a partially melted [candle of invocation](Mechanics/items/candle-of-invocation.md) of a random alignment that has 1 hour of use remaining.

#### W3: Main Room

A character who listens carefully before entering this area and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check can hear the tieflings inside discussing whether to betray someone named Thlaarsh.

When a character enters this area, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A spiral staircase emerges through the floor into this multiuse kitchen and social area. To the north, a ladder ascends to the floor above, and six simple doors ring the room. To the west are several cabinets and cooking spaces that have been pillaged, with pots and foodstuffs scattered across the floor. Two tieflings in spiked armor conspire over the table.
^0b0

The tieflings are neutral evil [gladiators](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) in the service of Thlaarsh (see area W5). They're hostile, but a character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or who offers each tiefling at least 1,000 gp convinces the pair to betray their yugoloth allies. Otherwise, the tieflings scream battle cries as they fight to the death. If the characters don't silence the tieflings quickly, the Fiends in areas W5, W6, and W7 are alerted.

Through doors to the southwest are a pantry and washroom. If a character dies in the castle, their incarnation appears in one of these rooms.

The ladder to the north leads to area W6.

##### Supplies

The kitchen has been plundered, but 14 days of [rations](Mechanics/items/rations-1-day.md) remain. These mostly consist of pickled radishes—a favorite of [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md)'s.

#### W4: Bedrooms

The following bedrooms surround the main room:

- **W4a.** This room has a single bed, a desk, and a cabinet containing loose robes.  
- **W4b.** This room has two beds, a writing desk, and an empty cabinet.  
- **W4c.** This room contains a large nest, once used by an avian scholar, and a cabinet with clothes suited for a winged wearer. A door to the east opens onto a sturdy log perch covered in old talon scratches.  

#### W5: Study

If the nycaloth in this room is aware of the characters, it casts [invisibility](Mechanics/spells/invisibility.md). When a character enters the room, read or paraphrase the following, leaving out the last sentence if the nycaloth is [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible):

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sizable desk stands opposite the door in this stuffy study. Cabinets, crowded bookshelves, and maps of the Outer Planes cover the room's walls. In the south corner stands a simple cot. A hulking, green-skinned figure with mighty wings and razor-sharp claws violently peruses the books, discarding those that displease it.
^0b4

This is [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md)'s study. The [nycaloth](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/nycaloth.md) Thlaarsh the Gore Drinker is here, seeking ways to make the castle move. Thlaarsh attacks rival trespassers and fights to the death, but it tries to capture spellcasters, hoping to make them pilot the castle.

##### Treasure

The desk holds [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md)'s notes on the Outlands, which are written in Gith, as well as [calligrapher's supplies](Mechanics/items/calligraphers-supplies.md). On the desk is a broken [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) (see "Sigil and the Outlands") with a skull made of colorful glass shards. This [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) is further detailed in the "Mosaic Mimir" section later in this chapter.

#### W6: Castellan Chamber

If the two mezzoloths in this room were alerted by noise in area W3, they cast [darkness](Mechanics/spells/darkness.md) before the characters enter. Otherwise, read or paraphrase the following when a character enters the room:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This chamber is dominated by a sculpture of a gigantic, humanlike figure looming over a broad, circular table. A ladder to the north descends, while a ladder to the south climbs to the floor above.
> 
> Two four-armed, insectile creatures inspect the sculpture and table, trying to break them loose.
^0b7

The two [mezzoloths](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/mezzoloth.md) attack the characters on sight and fight to the death.

##### Castellan

The statue and table here are together a unique magical being known as the Castellan. It is dormant when the characters initially enter this room. See "The Castellan" later in the chapter for additional details.

##### Secret Door

A character who investigates the south wall and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a secret door that slides open. In this space is a small table on which sit several candles and a [necklace of prayer beads](Mechanics/items/necklace-of-prayer-beads.md) with `1d4 + 2` magic beads.

#### W7: Meditation Chamber

The lights in this room have been destroyed, leaving the area in dim light.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ancient tapestries of the planes and cosmic alignments cover the walls of this simple room. Ladders descend to the floor below and rise to the level above.
^0bb

An [incubus](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/incubus.md) named Arcis, who serves Thlaarsh, waits in this room, guarding the prisoner on the floor above. If he heard battle in areas W3 or W6, he transforms himself to look like a wizened gnome wearing the robes and tall hat of a member of the Fraternity of Order. He pretends to be a prisoner and lies to the characters, begging them to help him get out of the tower before more Fiends arrive. This is a ploy to drive the characters toward any Fiends surviving on the floors below. If none remain, he either tries to escape the tower or uses the characters to his advantage.

#### W8. Signal Tower

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Narrow windows look out from this stark stone chamber in every direction. In the room's center stands a green crystal atop a stone pillar. A ladder descends to the floor below. Seated in a corner is a githyanki woman with long, white hair and closed eyes.
^0bd

The Fiends have kept the castle's caretaker, a neutral [githzerai uniter](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-uniter-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") named [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md), in this chamber. [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) is eager to be free and evict the devils from her home. She is further detailed in the "Zaythir" section.

##### Crystal

The green crystal affixed to the pedestal is a [gem of brightness](Mechanics/items/gem-of-brightness.md). When the gem is lit, its light can be seen over a mile away.

### Castle's Residents

Once the Fiends are defeated and [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) is freed, the characters have access to the walking castle and the gratitude of its residents. These residents help the characters however they can.

![The githzerai Zaythir uses...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/021-02-002.zaythir.webp#center "The githzerai Zaythir uses the Castellan to set the walking castle's course across the Outlands")

#### Zaythir

[Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) is a patient scholar of the planes who rarely shows extremes of emotion. If she is freed and the Fiends are driven out of her home, she's indebted to the characters. She introduces herself and can provide information on the following topics:

- **Personal Background.** [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) is a scholar of the planes who studies the Outlands and the planes beyond. She has guarded the walking castle alone for years.  
- **The Castellan.** This magical being is [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md)'s companion and the heart of Iedcaru. It controls the castle's movement. [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) can introduce the characters to it (see the "The Castellan" section).  
- **Walking Castle.** The walking castle is called Iedcaru. It is a repository of learning and a place to study the Outer Planes. It was created by githzerai long ago.  
- **Modron.** [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) was recently visited by a monodrone who called himself [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). He had been using a [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) (see "Sigil and the Outlands") to follow the path of the last Great Modron March, intending to learn truths of the multiverse. He left his [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) here, saying it told him where to go after visiting all the gate-towns (though he didn't say where that was). His mimir was damaged during the Fiends' attack (see the "Mosaic Mimir" section).  

[Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) knows nothing about the multiversal glitch affecting the characters, but she's happy to let them research in the castle's library. Unfortunately, the library contains no information on the characters' circumstances.

If it's clear the characters plan to explore the Outlands, [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) offers to help, both by sharing her knowledge of the plane and by letting the group travel via Iedcaru and use it as a base.

#### The Castellan

This magical wonder is inert when the characters first enter area W6. [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) can reactivate it with a word, at which point its body animates and the table before it projects an illusory image of the Outlands.

The Castellan has the following features:

- The Castellan is neutral and has an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12.  
- The Castellan has hearing and [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet, and it can understand Common and Gith but can't speak. It communicates through gestures alone.  
- The Castellan can cause Iedcaru to stand or sit. While the castle stands, its lowest level is 40 feet off the ground. The castle can walk at the rate of 12 miles per hour, but it can go no faster or slower.  
- The Castellan controls the walking castle and is friendly toward those who rescued [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md). If the Castellan's attitude changes, a character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to convince it to navigate the castle.  
- The Castellan is indestructible so long as the walking castle stands.  

Provide the players with the "poster map" of the Outlands, and let them use it to determine where the Castellan should navigate Iedcaru next.

### Mosaic Mimir

The Mosaic Mimir is a [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) (see "Sigil and the Outlands") that looks like a human skull made of gold, silver, jade, and onyx. The *mimir* was badly damaged in the attack on Iedcaru, and it lies in pieces.

The Mosaic Mimir can be physically repaired by a character who spends an hour and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) can repair it if the characters can't. While this repairs the [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) physically, it doesn't restore the lost information about the Outlands. The *mimir* once knew information about all the gate-towns and their portals to the Outer Planes, but it is now missing data on the following gate-towns:

- Automata  
- Curst  
- Excelsior  
- Faunel  
- Glorium  
- Rigus  
- Sylvania  

The [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) is also missing data on the last Great Modron March (see "The Last Great Modron March"). This information still exists, but it's inaccessible until the data on the gate-towns is restored.

#### Restoring the Mimir's Data

![R04M the Missing Monodrone](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/022-02-003.ro4m.webp#center)

The [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) holds the key to finding [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), but it must have its missing data restored to access its Esoteric Knowledge and Planar Knowledge properties (detailed in "Sigil and the Outlands"). [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check knows that the following steps are required to restore missing data to the *mimir*:

- **Planar Precision.** The mimir must be in the place it is receiving data about. In the case of a gate-town, this means being within 5 feet of a gate-town's portal.  
- **Information Entry.** Whoever is attuned to the [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) must record a description of the location and their impression of it. This process takes 1 minute.  

Use the Mimir Restoration Tracker (handout 4.1) to note the gist of reports on gate-towns and whether they seem accurate (this is relevant to the adventure's conclusion). Consider earnest attempts at reporting accurate even if they lack certain details. Recordings with purposeful omissions, falsehoods, or editorializing should be considered skewed.

![Handout 4.1: Mimir Restoration Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/023-02-017.mimir-tracker.webp#center)

#### The Last Great Modron March

Once data on all seven missing gate-towns is restored, the [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) can report on the Great Modron March. It provides the following details:

- The Great Modron March is a procession of countless modrons conducted every 289 years to collect information about the multiverse and realign the workings of the plane of Mechanus.  
- Untold numbers of modrons are lost during the march, and sometimes whole tangents of the march split off and get lost.  
- The march enters the Outlands through the portal in the gate-town of Automata.  
- The march visits all the gate-towns, then passes through the rilmani settlement of Dendradis at the base of the Spire. From there, the march ventures through portals into other planes, with a much-diminished number eventually returning to Mechanus.  
- The last Great Modron March occurred ahead of schedule and experienced a heightened number of irregularities and losses for tenebrous reasons.  

### Around the Outlands

[Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) can help the characters piece together that to find [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), they must restore the Mosaic Mimir by visiting the seven gate-towns for which it's missing data. Then, it should be able to relate the details about the last Great Modron March, which [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) was following. The characters might seek other sources for information about the last Great Modron March, but the event was so fraught with incongruities and lost so many modrons that it's impossible to know what tangent of the march [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is following. [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) also offers to let the characters use Iedcaru as a base and conveyance across the Outlands—though [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) won't leave the Outlands herself or let the walking castle travel to other planes.

> [!note] 
> 
> Directions in the Outlands
> 
> As in Sigil, there are no literal cardinal directions in infinite planes like the Outlands. Nevertheless, maps and descriptions refer to such directions for ease of use. To aid in navigation, residents of the Outlands refer to the direction toward the Spire as "spireward." This is a relative direction, as spireward in Automata is the opposite direction from spireward from Xaos.
^0c6

#### Adventures in the Outlands

Chapters 5 to 11 detail exploits in the seven gate-towns where the characters need to collect information to restore the Mosaic Mimir. These seven chapters can be run in any order. Chapter 12 provides supplementary encounters you can use at any time. The Castellan can provide the characters with an illusory version of the "poster map of the Outlands" from "Sigil and the Outlands". Then, the characters can decide where they wish to travel.

#### Travel in the Outlands

The Outlands is infinite in size and changes constantly. This makes the distances between locations and the time it takes to get from place to place variable. How long travel takes is up to you—it could take `3d6` days to get from one gate-town to the next closest one, or weeks, or longer. While traveling in the walking castle, the characters are safe, and encounters occur only when you choose.

Time also has little meaning, as the characters and many of the NPCs in this adventure are effectively immortal. The following chapters could take place over the course of weeks, years, or centuries, and the results would be the same. Creatures in the Outlands might experience time differently from one another, so make use of NPCs and encounters whenever or wherever you want.

#### Advancing in Level

Characters gain 1 level every time they complete two of the gate-town adventures in part 2. This is outlined on the Levels in the Outlands table. The characters will be 9th level before starting chapter 13.

**Levels in the Outlands**

| Adventures Completed | Advance to... |
|----------------------|---------------|
| In two gate-towns | 7th level |
| In four gate-towns | 8th level |
| In six gate-towns | 9th level |
^levels-in-the-outlands

## Chapter 5–Automata: Recalibration

At the center of Automata stands a massive, toothed cog that encloses the gate to Mechanus, the plane of ultimate order. This towering gear rotates slowly—one booming tick at a time—in sync with the workings of the plane beyond. To repair the Mosaic Mimir, the characters must visit Automata's gate—a feat easier said than done in the rigidly structured gate-town. To complicate matters, agents of chaos are eager to disrupt the town's perfect order.

Automata is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Beltha and her chaotic gan...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/024-02-004.the-inverse.webp#center "Beltha and her chaotic gang operate out of the Inverse, the upside-down realm beneath Automata")

### Exploring Automata

> [!quote] A quote from Legis, former Council of Anarchy member before being imprisoned in Mechanus  
> 
> "You think Automata's straight streets and ticks and tocks are order?! Wake up! The powers of Mechanus don't want what's best for you. They want you predicable. Don't feed yourself to their machine!"

As the characters approach Automata, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Rigid beings move purposefully through Automata's perfect street grid. Most travel in sync with the reverberating rhythm of the great, toothed gear that rises like an arch at the gate-town's center. As you near the community, your mimir rattles energetically, and the glow in its eye sockets pulses in time with the pervasive ticking.
^0cc

Locals can provide the characters with directions to anywhere in the town, but their instructions are precise and tediously step-by-step. To record an entry for the Mosaic Mimir, the characters need to visit the gate to Mechanus.

#### Gate to Mechanus

With its size and persistent ticking, the gate to Mechanus is the central presence in Automata. Using the gate sends travelers to a location in Mechanus designated by complicated factors predicable only to the modrons overseeing the gate.

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters approach the gate:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A forest of stanchions creates a mile-long path to the great mechanized gate at Automata's center. Hundreds of travelers stand in queue, seeking to pass through the gate to Mechanus. Amid the line, modron overseers orchestrate the orderly, sluggish procession to the gate.
^0ce

#### Guarding the Gate

The gate to Mechanus is guarded by a [decaton modron](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/decaton-modron-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") and four [pentadrones](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/pentadrone.md). If any of these modrons are attacked or feel threatened, they can call on more pentadrones, which arrive in 3 rounds. The guards are indifferent to the characters, and they tell anyone who approaches to get in line. It takes 19 (`3d12`) hours for a creature at the back of the line to reach the gate. Even then, only those with a gate-access permit may approach the gate (see "Accessing the Gate"). If anyone approaches with questions about the gate, the guards direct them to the Gate Travel Administration.

The modron guards don't allow anyone to approach the gate without approval. If anyone refuses orders to move along, the guards become hostile. They try to forcibly move dawdlers away, and they attack to subdue and arrest those who resist. Should the characters come into conflict with the modron guards, Aristimus interrupts and orders the modrons to stand down after 1 round (proceed with "Agents of Order").

#### Accessing the Gate

Creatures seeking to use the gate or get close enough to record data using the Mosaic Mimir must obtain an access permit at the Gate Travel Administration building nearby. This monument to bureaucracy is filled with offices, forms, modron officials, and lengthy queues. It takes 26 (`4d12`) hours of standing in lines and answering repetitive questions before the characters receive the exception forms they need to fill out to approach the gate. This halfling-sized stack of forms takes `1d4` days to fill out and requires a character to succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If a character fails this check, they miss a field or otherwise err and are provided a new stack of forms to fill out. These take just as long to complete as the first set of forms.

If the characters settle in for the long haul of Mechanus bureaucracy, word filters through the administration's ranks until Aristimus hears about the characters and comes to investigate their intentions after `1d4` hours (proceed with "Agents of Order").

#### Agents of Order

Aristimus (lawful neutral [githzerai futurist](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-futurist-mpp.md); see "Morte's Planar Parade") is the captain of Automata's guards and a member of the town's ruling body, the Council of Order. If the characters clearly want to use the gate for something other than travel to Mechanus, they come to Aristimus's attention, either at the gate or in the Gate Travel Administration. The guard captain approaches them with a job in mind. Read or paraphrase the following text to introduce Aristimus:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stiff-looking githzerai man with a sharp uniform and sharper mustache approaches, sizes you up, and nods. "You seem like you're in a bit of a hurry. What business do you have in Mechanus?"
^0d2

Aristimus allows the characters to explain their situation. After they do, Aristimus introduces himself and shares that he's one of the town's leaders. Read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I don't see the harm in admitting you to the gate. Of course, I'll have to convince the rest of the Council of Order of your intentions. If you take care of something that's been vexing us, though, that gesture of good faith could make all the difference.
> 
> "There are discordant elements operating in Automata. One such individual is an outlaw named Beltha. She recently stole one of the logbooks for the Concordant Express. It contains timetables, passenger lists, manifests, and more. Recover the logbook, and I'll see to it that you can use the gate as you require. And if you bring Beltha in, I'll throw in a bonus."
^0d3

Aristimus can also offer the following information:

- Beltha is a githzerai outlaw who operates in the underground tunnels known as the Inverse.  
- If the characters return the logbook, capture Beltha, and bring her to the Hall of Order alive, he'll reward them with 2,000 gp, or half that amount if she's brought in dead.  
- Beltha has a distinctive tattoo around her left eye that looks like a shattered gear.  
- Getting into the Inverse isn't difficult, as many staircases, vents, and drains lead to the underground.  
- Beltha has previously met contacts at the Divine Machine tavern.  

Once their conversation is over, Aristimus wishes the party luck and leaves them to their business.

#### Finding Beltha

The characters have two options to track down Beltha:

- **Search the Inverse.** Characters can search the Inverse for Beltha, but doing so without a lead takes `2d4` hours. A character who then succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check locates Beltha's hideout (see "Seeds of Chaos"). Due to the chaotic essence of the Inverse, lawfully aligned characters have disadvantage on this check.  
- **Stake Out.** Characters who go to the Divine Machine and spend `1d4` hours watching the clientele eventually see a dwarf [Hands of Havoc fire starter](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hands-of-havoc-fire-starter-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") with a tattoo on his arm that matches the description of Beltha's tattoo. This is an associate of Beltha named Xannik. A character can tail Xannik to Beltha's lair in the Inverse by succeeding on a DC 14 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check, or they can convince him to give up her location by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Failing everything else, paying Xannik 200 gp gets him to give up Beltha's location.  

### The Inverse

> [!quote] A quote from Karol Kolcha, Automata guard  
> 
> "The Inverse isn't a mistake; it serves a vital role. All Automata's most disruptive elements shake to the bottom. We'll never be rid of such glitches–and most will never be a problem–but when one is, we know where to go to deal with it."

An underground complex of tunnels and machinery sprawls beneath Automata, and below that labyrinth is the inverted town of the Inverse. There, gravity pulls toward the surface, allowing rebels and outcasts to create a warped mirror of Automata where chaos reigns.

Stairs leading between the Inverse and the surface have strange angles 30 feet below the surface. There, gravity changes, and creatures descending into the depths start climbing into the Inverse. Eventually they reach a series of caverns filled with haphazardly arranged buildings and interconnected tunnels—as chaotic as Automata is orderly.

> ![Map 5.1: Inverse Hideout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/025-map-2.02-inverse-hideout.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/026-map-2.02-inverse-hideout-player.webp#gallery)

#### Features of the Inverse

The Inverse has the following features:

- **Chaotic Essence.** At a point 30 feet below the surface of Automata and lower, the Inverse is saturated with the essence of chaos. Due to disorientation and headaches, lawful creatures in this area have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.  
- **Gravity.** Gravity in the Inverse pulls toward an invisible, horizontal plane 30 feet below the surface.  
- **Light.** The tunnels and chambers of the Inverse are dark unless otherwise noted. Locals carry their own light sources as necessary.  

#### Seeds of Chaos

The residents of the Inverse are largely freethinkers and anarchists, with a smattering of criminals. Most fled here to avoid being prosecuted for crimes. Roll on the Inverse Incidents table for additional encounters characters might have in the Inverse.

**Inverse Incidents**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^inverse-incidents)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Three [kenku](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/kenku.md) mockingly mimic the voices of modrons as they try to steal the Mosaic Mimir. They retreat if threatened. |
| 2 | Two [Hands of Havoc fire starters](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/hands-of-havoc-fire-starter-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") encourage the characters to share how "the system" has wronged them and offer a [potion of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) if a character has need. |
| 3 | A silent [green slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/green-slaad.md) insistently tries to take a character's flashiest article of clothing. |
| 4 | A chaotic neutral [duodrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/duodrone.md) carries a sign that reads "Glitch Is Nigh!" It entreats a character to prepare for the great multiversal realignment. |
^inverse-incidents

#### Inverse Hideout

Beltha's lair is a series of chambers at the edge of the Inverse (depicted on map 5.1). It takes 30 minutes to find the lair if the characters know the way. Refer to the "Finding Beltha" section if the characters don't know where to go.

When the characters reach the steam-pipe-lined tunnels where Beltha hides out, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gridded iron balcony overlooks an unevenly shaped room full of intertwining pipes and machinery with noisy, exposed gears. Gas lamps shed flickering light across the area.
> 
> Haphazard furnishings, battered crates, and mismatched knickknacks decorate the balcony above. A rusty iron spiral staircase on the room's far side climbs to this ramshackle lounge.
^0d9

Beltha (chaotic neutral [githzerai zerth](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/githzerai-zerth.md)) is on the balcony above with her allies Kit and Kot (chaotic neutral [quadrones](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md)). Below, near the spiral stairs, is the [red slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/red-slaad.md) Kythkyr. The group is hostile to trespassers and demands they leave. The group attacks the following round. The quadrones favor using their Shortbow attacks, while Kythkyr tries to prevent intruders from climbing to the balcony.

A character who uses an action and succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince Beltha to call off her gang and talk (see "Talking with Beltha" for details).

##### Exposed Machinery

The area is filled with hazardous machinery that can catch creatures in its gears. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of these machines, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage and have the [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 15) as it becomes caught in the gears. A [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) creature can make another saving throw to escape the gears at the start of its next turn.

##### Treasure

The crates and workbenches in the room are covered in rusted, worthless tools. On the balcony above lie knickknacks and pieces of symmetrical art worth a total of 200 gp. A character who examines the couch on the balcony and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check finds a stash of several well-packed, precision-made lenses hidden between the cushions. These lenses are worth 750 gp total.

#### Talking with Beltha

Beltha is an agitator in the Inverse. She's irreverent and doesn't believe people are meant to live as rigidly as the Council of Order and the powers of Mechanus prescribe. She stole the logbook from Concord Terminus to remind Automata's residents that even the modrons' plans aren't perfect. She plans to sell the logbook and expects to get 1,000 gp for it. She'll sell it to the characters for 1,500 gp, or 1,000 gp if a character succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

Beltha fights to the death to avoid being taken prisoner.

### Conclusion

If the characters return to him with the logbook and Beltha, Aristimus is outwardly reserved but inwardly delighted. So long as the logbook is recovered, he provides the characters with a pass to access the gate to Mechanus, along with a simple trinket: a precise copper pocket watch with a face that tracks 168 hours. The watch is worth 500 gp—double that in lawfully aligned settlements, such as Automata. If the characters also return with Beltha, Aristimus provides the bonus he offered: 2,000 gp if Beltha is alive and 1,000 gp if not.

If the characters failed in their mission, Aristimus thanks them for their time and directs them to the line of applicants seeking gate access.

When the characters have completed their work in Automata, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 6–Curst: Invisible Bonds

The gate-town of Curst stands as an entrapping ring around the gate to the prison plane of Carceri. A sinkhole of betrayers and a haven for those who don't want to be found, Curst is a place where anyone is welcome to enter—but leaving is another story.

Completing an entry on Curst for the Mosaic Mimir is easy; no one stands in the characters' way. Once the characters are inside the gate-town's walls, though, they're not allowed to leave. A secret path to freedom exists, but the characters must be willing to pay the price and take the risks of accessing it.

Curst is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Without help, Valder and F...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/027-02-005.valder-and-fellik.webp#center "Without help, Valder and Fellik Sands have little hope of escaping the oppressive gate-town of Curst")

### Exploring Curst

As the characters approach Curst, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The odor of rusty metal stings every breath. Ahead lies the gate-town of Curst, a dismal-looking community surrounded by an imposing wall. Hulking sentries mind the barrier and oversee an open gate into town. As you near the gate-town, your mimir chimes, and its eye sockets flicker like a dying candle flame.
^0e0

Two [maelephants](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") allow the characters to enter the gate-town. As they enter, characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher notice that the community's gates have bars only on the outside—as if they're designed to keep people inside. Those who question the guards here are told to move along (see the "Curst's Walls" section for details).

Inside, the characters find Curst's townsfolk to be a sour, suspicious lot who are generally uninterested in conversation. Getting terse directions to the gate to Carceri or any of the Curst locations requires a successful DC 14 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

> [!quote] A quote from Tovus Gilaf, former burgomaster of Curst, to his replacement, Villigus Bazengar  
> 
> "We're the refuse of the Outlands, the debris of shattered dreams, the waste of every failed vengeance. We're the scum of the multiverse... but we're still better than you."

#### Encounters in Curst

While exploring Curst, the characters might have any of the encounters listed on the Curst Encounters table.

**Curst Encounters**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^curst-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [farastu demodand](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/farastu-demodand-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") drags a [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md) to the gate to Carceri and intends to throw the criminal through it. |
| 2 | The locals ignore a gigantic crash that echoes through town. The noise originated at the town dump; it was caused by the collapse of a towering metal sculpture built by the dour [adult copper dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-copper-dragon.md) Tudhog the Junk Wyrm (see the ""Curst"" section of "Sigil and the Outlands"). |
| 3 | A hateful criminal ([cult fanatic](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md)) jeers at the characters from a public pillory or hanging cage. |
| 4–6 | Eyes peer at the characters from the shadows. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, the watcher is a [spy](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) who's suspicious of the characters. If you roll an odd number, it's a [cranium rat squeaker swarm](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/cranium-rat-squeaker-swarm-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). |
^curst-encounters

### Gate to Carceri

In the center of Curst stands a rusty metal arch filled with swirling crimson sands and echoing with anguished wails. This is the gate to Carceri, also known as the Shackled Gate. No guards or deterrents block access to the gate. The gate is a two-way portal to Carceri, but most locals believe it's a one-way gate and refuse to approach. Characters loitering near the gate with the Mosaic Mimir might draw odd looks, but no challenges.

#### Curst's Walls

A 30-foot-tall wall of rusted metal and razorvine surrounds Curst. It's patrolled by a ruthless cadre of guards called the Wall Watch. These guards are under orders from the town's leader, Baron Villigus Bazengar, to prevent anyone from leaving. Two neutral evil [veterans](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) and a [maelephant](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") guard Curst's gates. If attacked, these guards call on additional [maelephants](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md), which arrive in 2 rounds. The Watch also uses a flight of four trained [wyverns](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) to prevent flying creatures from escaping. If the characters attack and are defeated by Curst's guards, the characters' bodies are thrown in the gate-town's dump.

#### Leaving Curst

The Wall Watch prevents characters from leaving Curst, using either threats or outright force. Characters who ask how to gain permission to leave the gate-town are dismissively referred to the burgomaster's estate to get permission from the burgomaster. Baron Villigus isn't currently in the gate-town, though, so even attempting to get his permission to leave is impossible. The [farastu demodands](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/farastu-demodand-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") who serve as the baron's guards stiffly relate this to anyone who appears at the estate before urging them to move on.

Once the challenges of leaving Curst become clear but before the characters make any elaborate escape attempts, proceed with the "Innocent Prisoner" section.

### Innocent Prisoner

Valder (neutral, human [Mercykiller bloodhound](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mercykiller-bloodhound-mpp.md); see "Morte's Planar Parade") is an ex-Mercykiller in hiding from his former faction. Decades ago, he disobeyed the Mercykillers by refusing to bring in a bounty he believed was innocent—a deed that led to other faction members' deaths. Valder abandoned his family when he fled his home in Sigil and went into hiding. Recently, Valder's son Fellik tracked his father down. The reunion healed old wounds for the pair but was bittersweet, as Fellik (lawful good, human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) died several years ago and is now a "petitioner" (detailed in "Morte's Planar Parade"). Now, Valder wants to help Fellik escape Curst and move on to his rightful afterlife.

#### Meeting Valder

Valder approaches the characters as they prepare to escape Curst. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An aged human wearing a tattered cloak approaches. His skin is crisscrossed with scars, and he carries himself with confidence. In a deep voice, the man rumbles, "They say no one leaves Curst. Really, you just need the right friends to get out, and you all look like you're in the friend-making mood."
^0e7

Valder introduces himself and asks if the characters want to join him and his son for tea and a chat about the gate-town's signature wall. If the characters agree, proceed with "Meeting Fellik." If the characters are suspicious, he becomes more forthright, telling them he and his son need help and inviting them to discuss details at his home.

#### Meeting Fellik

Valder's home, a tiny shack near the town dump, is made of rusted metal plates and scavenged wood. It is simply furnished with a few chairs, a table, a kitchenette, and a bench cluttered with metal scraps and tools. A curtained-off area holds a single bed.

After Valder hurries everyone inside and bars the door, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Once you're inside, Valder calls out in a worried voice, "Fellik?" A moment later, a young man enters the space from a curtained-off bedroom. He resembles the older man, though his skin is partially transparent.
> 
> "Time to go already, father?" the young man asks.
^0e9

Fellik died in an accident in Sigil several years ago. When he manifested as a "petitioner", he took the form he had in life. However, his body, while still corporeal, is semitransparent like a ghost. Fellik and Valder have spent several weeks reconciling, but they've agreed it's time for Fellik to move on to his rightful afterlife in Mount Celestia.

Fellik is good natured but cautious and indecisive. He's wary of the characters and won't do anything they say unless a character does it first.

#### A Father's Request

Valder gets straight to the point: he wants the characters to help his son escape Curst. He can share any of the information in the "Innocent Prisoner" section, as well as the following details:

- Valder knows of a tunnel in the dump that goes under Curst's walls.  
- Fellik can lead the characters to the tunnel, but the way is dangerous.  
- Valder wants the characters to protect Fellik on his way out of the city.  
- If pressed, Valder explains that he refuses to leave Curst, as he fears the Mercykillers are still hunting for him and he doesn't want to put Fellik in danger by association.  

Valder offers the characters no reward—their reward is escape from Curst. If pressed, Valder flips them 2 electrum coins, which is most of the money he has in the shack (he saves another 5 coins for Fellik).

If the characters agree to help, Valder encourages them to wait until nightfall, then return, collect Fellik, and head to the dump. He urges the characters to leave so he and Fellik can say their goodbyes. Use this time to let the characters explore or run scenes from the Curst Encounters table.

### Curst Escape

When the characters return to Valder's shack, Fellik is ready to go. Valder gives his son a pouch containing 5 ep, and the pair share a brief hug. Fellik then leads the characters toward the dump. The journey through town is uneventful, but characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 16 or higher notice locals watching them suspiciously.

When the characters arrive at the dump, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Mountains of junk fill countless acres of Curst's dump. Debris range from simple trash to the ruins of massive structures to the blasted remains of mighty constructs. Fellik quickly leads you through a series of trash canyons.
^0ec

#### Curst Escape Features

Curst's dump has the following features:

- **Garbage Heaps.** Trash heaps are 20 feet tall.  
- **Garbage Tunnels.** Interior spaces are cavities in the surrounding junk with 8-foot-high ceilings.  
- **Lighting.** During the day, the dump is brightly lit. At night and in interior spaces, the dump isn't illuminated. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Sludge.** Viscous runoff pools in the dump. Unless otherwise noted, this sludge is 2 feet deep and is "difficult terrain". Creatures that try to leave a pool of sludge must succeed on a DC 8 Strength saving throw or have the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. A [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can make another saving throw to escape the sludge at the start of its next turn.  

#### Curst Escape Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 6.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 6.1: Curst Escape](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/028-map-2.02-curst-escape.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/029-map-2.02-curst-escape-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1. Junk Heaps

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The paths through the junk open into a canyon of smashed statuary. The largest sculpture is a two-story-tall dragon skull made of rusted metal, which protrudes from a towering trash heap. Noxious sludge pools around the skull.
^0f0

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher hear bubbling and dirge-like humming from the pool. These noises come from two [otyughs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/otyugh.md) partially submerged in the sludge. They are influenced by energies from Carceri that make them gray, dour, and envious of anyone seeking freedom. If the characters don't make themselves known as they approach, the otyughs are startled and attack. Should the characters try to communicate, the otyughs speak in Otyugh and insist to know what the characters are doing. If characters reveal they're trying to escape, or if they're unable to answer, the otyughs attack. Otherwise, the otyughs are indifferent to the characters.

##### Dragon Skull

Fellik knows that the dragon's eye sockets hide a hidden path. It can be accessed by climbing 20 feet up the garbage heaps.

#### C2. Hidden Tunnel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A narrow passage winds through tons of debris before opening into a leaking, dead-end cavity. Oily sludge pools along the east edge of the chamber.
^0f3

There is no obvious exit from this chamber, and Fellik doesn't know where to go from here. The young man swiftly grows concerned, fearing he and his father have been betrayed.

A character who inspects the ground and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds footprints leading into the sludge. Creatures that enter the sludge and search for a passage find a submerged tunnel leading through the opaque slime. Although the prospect is disgusting, creatures can swim through the sludge as if it were water.

#### C3. Escape Route

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A pool of sludge opens into a small, air-filled chamber buried in the junk heaps. A tight tunnel runs from here into darkness. Two figures in bladed armor lean against a wall, a fist-sized, glowing sphere of red light floating over them.
^0f5

The figures are Amod Ka and Lot Sheng, lawful neutral, human [Mercykiller bloodhounds](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mercykiller-bloodhound-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). Lot's [driftglobe](Mechanics/items/driftglobe.md) lights the room. On spotting Fellik, Amod asks, "Any luck finding your pops, kid?"

Amod and Lot are indifferent to the characters, but not to Fellik. They share the following details:

- They followed Fellik to Curst, hoping to track down Valder.  
- They intend to capture Fellik and force him to lead them to his father.  
- They encourage the characters not to get involved, explaining Valder is a criminal who let a murderer go free, resulting in multiple Mercykiller deaths.  

Fellik stammers and lies poorly to the Mercykillers, but they're convinced Valder is in the gate-town. Amod and Lot soon move to drag off Fellik. If the characters impede or attack the pair, the Mercykillers attack. The Mercykillers fight to the death.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check convinces the Mercykillers that Valder is dead or not in Curst.

##### Tunnel

The tunnel to the north winds for nearly a mile before ending in an arch in the wall. This a portal to a stand of trees 3 miles outside Curst. The portal's key is an electrum coin.

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when the characters escape Curst. Once they do, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the party determine their next destination.

If Fellik is with the characters, he tells them he plans to head to Excelsior. If the characters offer to escort him, he welcomes the help but can't reward them. On reaching the gate-town, Fellik thanks the characters before departing to Mount Celestia.

## Chapter 7–Excelsior: Lost Souls

Excelsior, the gate-town to the heavenly plane of Mount Celestia, welcomes any who are willing to embrace the lofty ideals of good and law. Good-hearted characters can easily reach the town's gate and update the Mosaic Mimir. In the process of doing so, they discover that while Excelsior strives to be an idyllic paradise, the gate-town has its problems.

Excelsior is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![A mysterious criminal uses...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/030-02-006.sinister-magic.webp#center "A mysterious criminal uses sinister magic to capture souls in Excelsior")

### Exploring Excelsior

As the characters approach Excelsior, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Floating gardens and palaces orbit the towering structures of Excelsior. From amid the tallest buildings rises a tower of alabaster and gleaming, colored glass that reaches into the clouds. As you near the tower, your mimir rings like a bell, and its eyes pulse with golden light.
^0fa

Celestial and Humanoid townsfolk go about their business in peaceful harmony, moving between lush gardens and crisply clean shops and homes. Shortly after the characters arrive, a smiling [lantern archon](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/lantern-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") approaches, welcomes the characters to Excelsior, and politely offers them directions to destinations in town.

> [!quote] A quote from Bibiana Tama, Excelsior florist  
> 
> "Excelsior isn't just a home; it's a way of life. We strive to live Excelsior every day. It's not always easy, but it's worth it to show the planes how little acts of good matter and can add up to something great."

#### The Godstrand

The gate to Mount Celestia stands atop the Godstrand, a soaring pillar whose top is perpetually hidden by clouds. Spiraling stairs ascend the tower. These are open to any who wish to climb, but those with corrupt intentions find the journey harrowing.

#### Climbing the Godstrand

Nearly a mile of stairs and ramps leads from the base of the Godstrand to its top. The stairs take most creatures approximately 18 minutes to climb.

Creatures of evil alignment see visions of judgment and shame in the mosaics that decorate the ascent. Every minute that an evil creature climbs the Godstrand or is otherwise within 100 feet of the gate to Mount Celestia, it must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has visions of its past wicked deeds and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) that can't be removed until it finishes a long rest away from the Godstrand. Creatures that reach level 5 [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) are eventually found by heavenly denizens and removed from the tower. This effect never causes a creature to have level 6 [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).

#### Gate to Mount Celestia

When the characters reach the gate to Mount Celestia, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fragrant breeze wafts across the platform atop the Godstrand. Several benches and bare pedestals surround a final flight of seven golden stairs. Atop these stairs, an archway of endlessly interweaving golden strands forms the gate to Mount Celestia. Two towering, bear-headed sentinels in heavy armor guard the gate. Other locals linger nearby, meditating on the gate.
^0fe

The gate's guards are [warden archons](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/warden-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). They question the intentions of anyone who nears the gate, but they allow the characters to ascend and use the Mosaic Mimir.

#### Uncertain Investigations

After the characters update their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md), they're approached by a [hound archon](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/hound-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). He's one of the locals who's been reflecting on the gate, and he introduces himself as Varrel, a member of the town guard. He asks if the characters are adventurers who'd be interested in helping him with a task. If the characters agree to hear him out, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The canine-headed archon lowers his voice and says, "I'm in an unusual predicament. Locals have been disappearing from Excelsior for weeks. My investigations led me to a tiefling named Sincerity, who has been seen near many of the places where people went missing. Recently I saw her enter a garden, and an individual there vanished soon after. Sincerity is being questioned at our headquarters now, but unless the interviewers turn up something, we have no proof to hold her. I have my suspicions, but I won't accuse someone who could be innocent based on my own possibly flawed perspective.

> "That's where you come in. You're not from Excelsior. I'd love to get visitors' insights on the situation and see if they reveal anything new. What do you say?"
^100

Varrel is willing to pay the characters for their aid, offering the group 2,500 gp and a [brooch of shielding](Mechanics/items/brooch-of-shielding.md) sculpted with watchful canine features. If the characters agree to aid Varrel, he shares what he knows and can lead the characters to either the headquarters of the Excelsior Guard or Sincerity's home (detailed later in this chapter).

#### Law and Archons

As a hound archon, Varrel is a being of absolute law and goodness. Even if the characters are helping him, he won't condone crimes. If he sees a character commit a crime or finds out about it, he fines them 100 gp. If they discover evidence while committing a crime, he disregards it and informs the characters that he won't let it be used against Sincerity.

If the characters repeatedly commit crimes, Varrel pays them as promised, then escorts them out of Excelsior.

### Viper in the Garden

The following sections detail the cause of the disappearances in Excelsior, what information Varrel already has, and other details the characters might gain in their investigations. The characters might discover these details in any order, but the information should ultimately point toward Uncle Longteeth. If the characters reach a dead end, use Varrel to offer them a hint.

#### The Soul Trade

No one in Excelsior is sure of it yet, but Sincerity is behind the disappearances in town. She uses empty [iron flasks](Mechanics/items/iron-flask.md) provided by the night hag Uncle Longteeth to capture victims, then uses her trained sunflies to deliver the flasks to him. The night hag plans to take the souls to Hades, where he'll transform them into [larvae](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/larva-dmg.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") and sell them as delicacies to deplorable immortals. The characters gradually discover this in the course of their investigation.

#### Missing Saints

Five lifelong residents of Excelsior have gone missing. Varrel and others can share the details from the Missing Excelsior Residents table.

**Missing Excelsior Residents**

| Name | Type | Last Seen at... |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Adorae | Dragonborn | Her home |
| Changle | Gnome | An alley near the Godstrand |
| Irruwabi | Human | The Temple of the Sunweaver |
| Wobeke | Human | His home |
| Yoi | Tiefling | The Forum |
^missing-excelsior-residents

None of the missing individuals had known rivals or left behind evidence. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check notes that none of these individuals is a native of the Outer Planes (a fact that matters for [iron flasks](Mechanics/items/iron-flask.md)).

#### Speaking with Sincerity

The headquarters of the Excelsior guard is a palatial tower filled with simple but comfortable offices, libraries, and meeting rooms. Varrel can escort the characters to the meeting room where Sincerity is being questioned. Read or paraphrase the following description when the characters arrive:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In this clean but stark and undecorated room converse two figures in comfortable chairs. One is a hound archon with long, straight hair, and the other is a venerable tiefling with gray braids and tiny horns, who smiles and nods as you enter.
^106

The [hound archon](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/hound-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") is Rolm, an investigator who has features like a terrier. The tiefling is Sincerity, a lawful evil [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) (without weapons at the moment). Sincerity benefits from a supernatural gift that permanently grants her the effects of the spell [glibness](Mechanics/spells/glibness.md).

Varrel and Rolm let the characters question Sincerity. The tiefling is patient and polite and assures them this is a misunderstanding. She can share the following information:

- Her name is Sincerity, and she's lived in Excelsior for over thirty years. Before that, she lived in Sigil.  
- She doesn't work, but she occasionally volunteers to play instruments for local youth theaters.  
- She doesn't know any of the people who have gone missing, but she hopes they're found safe soon.  
- She has nothing to do with any disappearances.  

Sincerity answers the characters' other questions along similar lines. If the characters ask her any of the following questions, she responds as noted:

**Why are so many sunflies at your house?** Sincerity says they're her pets—she likes their colors.

**Why do your sunflies fly to Uncle Longteeth's wagon**? Sincerity claims not to know. Maybe he's trying to steal away her babies?

**Who is Uncle Longteeth**? She claims not to know.

Varrel and Rolm don't allow the characters to harm Sincerity or use magic on her. Even if the characters detect and note Sincerity's evil alignment, the archons dismiss this as invasive, inconclusive, and inadmissible in Excelsior's courts.

#### Sincerity's Home

If the characters ask to go to Sincerity's home, Varrel directs them to a tower of comfortable apartments. He won't go with them, as a lantern archon calls him away for some official errand.

The characters can decide what they want to do once they know where Sincerity lives. Her home has the following elements:

- **Front Door.** The door to Sincerity's home is locked, but it can be picked by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.  
- **Cozy Interior.** Inside, the characters find a cozy but simple living space, kitchen, and bedroom. Sincerity's home holds no evidence of anything sinister and nothing worth more than 5 sp.  
- **Terrace.** This terrace of blooming lilacs is accessible from Sincerity's home or by creatures that can reach its 150-foot height. A large cage there holds eight [sunflies](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/sunfly-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). The sunflies glow in rainbow hues. The door to their cage is closed by a simple hook.  

If a character opens the sunfly cage, a sunfly hops forward and raises its foremost limbs, as if it wants a tiny hug. If a character places any Tiny object in a sunfly's grip, the creature takes the object and begins flying spireward out of Excelsior. It ultimately lands at Uncle Longteeth's wagon, drops whatever it was holding, and then flies back to the cage.

#### Questioning Locals

The characters might question Excelsior locals, witnesses Varrel knows were near a disappearance, or Sincerity's neighbors. If so, relevant locals might share the following information:

- Sincerity seems like a nice person, but she keeps to herself.  
- The local saw Sincerity walking near where someone went missing, but they didn't see her do anything wrong.  
- Sincerity keeps sunflies. They're unusual in town, but they're harmless, pleasant creatures. The local sees them buzz around sometimes. (If pressed about the sunflies' travels, the local recalls they've seen the sunflies follow a regular path spireward.)  
- A character who mentions strange lights or succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check causes the local to recall that they saw colorful lights near where a missing person vanished.  

### Uncle Longteeth's Wagon

If the characters head a mile spireward out of town or follow Sincerity's sunflies, they find Uncle Longteeth's wagon. Read or paraphrase the following when they arrive:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An enclosed wagon sits in a soggy dell outside Excelsior. It appears to be made more of mold and moss than timbers. Instead of wheels, the wagon rests atop what appears to be six giant, rolled-up pill bugs. A rickety door stands at its rear.
^10a

This wagon is the home of Uncle Longteeth, a [night hag](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) that trades in artisanal larvae across the Lower Planes. Uncle Longteeth is waiting for another delivery from Sincerity and rudely tells visitors to go away. He attacks if his wagon is broken into or if he's presented with evidence that he's involved with Sincerity's crimes—such as the fact that her sunfly pets are trained to come to him. The night hag flees using [plane shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) if reduced to 30 or fewer hit points.

Uncle Longteeth's wagon is filled with empty, filthy cages. It also holds a locked chest, which a character can pick by succeeding on a DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Inside the chest are six bottles that function similarly to [iron flasks](Mechanics/items/iron-flask.md), but they work only in the Outlands. Trapping a creature or releasing a creature in any of these flasks is possible only on this plane.

One of the flasks is empty, but the other five hold the individuals detailed in the "Missing Saints" section. If any of these individuals are freed, they confirm it was Sincerity who imprisoned them.

#### Decisive Evidence

Sincerity drops her act and confesses to her crimes in the following circumstances:

- **Freed Captives.** The missing individuals are freed and identify her as having imprisoned them.  
- **Captive Accomplice.** Uncle Longteeth is captured and handed over to Excelsior's guards.  
- **Compelling Story.** A character presents multiple compelling circumstances—like locals noticing colored lights that could belong to Sincerity's sunflies and her sunflies flying to Uncle Longteeth's wagon—and succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.  

Sincerity pleasantly surrenders after confessing her crimes. The guards collect Uncle Longteeth's [iron flasks](Mechanics/items/iron-flask.md) as evidence. If the characters refuse to surrender the flasks, Varrel explains he needs the bottles to ensure Sincerity meets justice at her trial. He'll look the other way if the characters take one [iron flask](Mechanics/items/iron-flask.md), but if they try to take more, he calls upon five other [hound archons](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/hound-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") who insist the characters relinquish the evidence.

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when Sincerity confesses to her crimes or the characters' investigation reaches a dead end. In either case, Varrel thanks the characters for their efforts and rewards them as agreed. Even if Varrel didn't get new evidence to use against Sincerity, he plans to keep working the case and see the missing locals saved in accordance with the law.

If the characters got Sincerity to confess, the hound archon Rolm seeks them out before they leave Excelsior. She thanks them on behalf of the gate-town and gifts them a [lantern of revealing](Mechanics/items/lantern-of-revealing.md).

If Uncle Longteeth escaped, he resents the characters for interfering with his business. Sometime later, he has a [smoke mephit](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/smoke-mephit.md) deliver them a threat: a [larva](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/larva-dmg.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") that bears a shocking resemblance to one of the characters.

After the characters complete their investigation, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the characters determine their next destination.

## Chapter 8–Faunel: Vicious Alliances

The gate-town of Faunel is undergoing a rebirth after the previous incarnation of the town merged with the Beastlands, leaving behind only its buildings. Amid the overgrown ruins of the previous community, factions of sapient animals vie to control the town's future. When bloodthirsty gnoll hunters arrive in the area, the town's peace becomes even more tenuous.

Faunel is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![The leaders of Faunel's th...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/031-02-008.leaders-of-faunel.webp#center "The leaders of Faunel's three packs of sapient animals argue over how best to lead the gate-town")

### Exploring Faunel

> [!quote] A quote from Zendri Cork, halfling herbalist at Camp Greenbriar  
> 
> "Faunel's one of the wildest places in the Outlands–most of the locals here are talking animals! But don't let yourself go primal. The last time things got too wild, the whole gate-town tipped right into the Beastlands!"

As the characters approach Faunel, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The calls of wildlife echo through a region where varied types of wildernesses meet. Forests, savannas, rocky deserts, mangrove swamps, tundras, and more form a wild patchwork. A faint ribbon of smoke leads to a collection of temporary structures that form a modest trading camp amid a sparse woodland. As you draw closer, the eyes of your mimir glow green.
^10f

The region ahead is Faunel. The gate-town is a collection of sites scattered across the region the former community used to occupy. Faunel's citizens are predominantly sapient animals. At Camp Greenbriar, these animals and a small population of Humanoids meet amid simple structures within a wooden palisade, where traders barter for the basics of survival. The entrance to the camp is unguarded.

Soon after the characters enter Camp Greenbriar, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Hello, travelers!" calls an energetic giant sloth wearing a bracelet of claws and feathers. The creature dangles from a nearby tree and waves a three-clawed paw. "Fresh faces are always welcome in Camp Greenbriar!"
^110

The sloth is named Razak. He uses [black bear](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/black-bear.md) stat block, with the following adjustments:

- Razak is neutral good.  
- He has a climbing speed of 10 feet.  
- He has an Intelligence of 10 and a Charisma of 14.  
- He speaks Common.  
- His bracelet functions as a [ring of animal influence](Mechanics/items/ring-of-animal-influence.md).  

Razak is gregarious and has a groan-worthy sense of humor. He welcome the characters and offers to answer any questions they have about the town or guide them to particular points of interest. He doesn't owe his allegiance to any of the three animal groups that hold power in Faunel (see the "The Three Packs" section later in this chapter) and instead works as a messenger between them.

#### Gate to the Beastlands

Nearly a mile from Camp Greenbriar stands the gate to the Beastlands: a peaceful pond surrounded by vine-covered ruins. A 20-foot-tall statue of a human with glowing eyes kneels by the pool. This is the guardian of the gate, an ancient being known as Wrath. It uses the [empyrean](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) stat block, with the following changes:

- Its creature type is Construct (Titan).  
- Its Maul attack is a Slam instead.  
- It automatically knows when it hears a lie.  

Wrath questions any creature approaching the pool, asking the creature's business in a booming voice. The guardian attacks any non-Beast who lies, refuses to answer, or tries to use the gate without Wrath's permission. If the characters are honest about why they want to use the gate, Wrath allows them to bring their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) close to the gate and record an entry for Faunel.

### Ravenous

While the characters are exploring the area around Faunel or headed back from the portal to the Beastlands, they happen on the following scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From ahead comes the sounds of voracious snapping punctuated by frantic, laugh-like vocalizations. The source is a band of gnolls messily consuming the recently slain carcass of a giant ibex.
^113

These six hunters (use the [gnoll pack lord](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll-pack-lord.md) stat blocks) are members of the Vile Hunt, a group of poachers murdering animals around Faunel. On noticing the characters, the gnolls attack. If four or more gnolls are killed, the survivors flee.

If Razak is with the characters, he avoids battle.

#### After the Battle

If Razak is with the characters after the battle, he identifies the ibex as Oka, a storyteller and advisor to [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md), leader of a group of local herbivores. If Razak wasn't with the characters, he comes across the scene as the battle ends and shares the same information. The ibex's body bears a distinguishing accessory: a beaded necklace with an eye-shaped topaz. The necklace is worth 40 gp.

Razak encourages the characters to come with him to Heart Delta to meet [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) and convey the news of Oka's death.

#### The Vile Hunt

Razak or others at Camp Greenbriar can identify the gnolls as members of the Vile Hunt. This group of local criminals hunt and kill for sport, targeting unawakened animals and Faunel's sapient residents indiscriminately. They're led by a cruel hunt master called Mick Mangehide. So far, the Vile Hunt has evaded locals' attempts to capture its members or drive them off.

### The Three Packs

Three factions of awakened animals seek to control Faunel. These factions are roughly divided into predators, flying creatures, and herbivores. Razak or the locals at Camp Greenbriar can direct the characters to the nearby wildernesses where these groups dwell.

#### Heart Delta

Heart Delta lies a few miles away from Camp Greenbriar. When the characters visit there, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sleepy rivers wind through a sprawling expanse of high grasses and fruiting trees. Giant herbivores, such as long-necked giraffes and brachiosaurs, munch on tall vegetation, while herds of bison, gazelle, and goats wander the surrounding plains. In the distance, rock formations encircle a broad crater.
^118

The crater at the center of Heart Delta is called the Hollow. Here the elephant [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) addresses hundreds of gathered animals nightly. Characters seeking [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) find her here.

[Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) uses the [elephant](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/elephant.md) stat block, with the following changes:

- [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) is lawful good.  
- She has an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14.  
- She speaks Common.  

#### Talking with Ophelia

[Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) is wise and patient, and she seeks to protect her people. She wants to create a new Faunel where sapient animals overcome their instincts and live communally. If the characters converse with her, she shares the following information:

- She's saddened to hear about Oka's death but thanks the characters for informing her.  
- She suspects the Vile Hunt is working for [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md), the leader of the predators at Razortooth Rock.  
- She recently defeated [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) in battle when he and some of his predators attacked a herd under her protection.  
- She suspects Oka's death is [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md)'s retaliation.  
- She asks the characters to go to Razortooth Rock and find out if [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) is working with the Vile Hunt.  

If the characters can find out who is behind Oka's death, [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) promises to reward them with a [figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)](Mechanics/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-serpentine-owl.md).

#### Razortooth Rock

Razortooth Rock stands 5 miles spireward from Camp Greenbriar. Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters approach:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An arid land of stark rock formations and rugged cliffs stretches ahead. Amid the dust, brush, and murky streams doze groups of wolves, tigers, hyenas, crocodiles, and more. A fang-shaped peak rises at the center of the wilderness, its surface etched with paths and caves.
^11b

Sapient predatory animals follow the characters through this wilderness but don't bother the characters. At Razortooth Rock, the peak at the center of this rugged land, the characters find [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md).

[Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) uses the [saber-toothed tiger](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/saber-toothed-tiger.md) stat block with the following changes:

- [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) is lawful neutral.  
- He has an Intelligence of 12 and a Charisma of 12.  
- He speaks Common.  

#### Talking with Ebonclaw

[Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) is arrogant and cunning, but he is nursing his wounded pride after a clash with [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md). He seeks to create a Faunel where the residents embrace their skills, becoming proud and powerful.

[Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) is suspicious of visitors, even if Razak is with them. He converses only if a character succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or brings him a gift of fresh yak meat. Characters might purchase yak meat at Camp Greenbriar for 20 gp or ask [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) to provide it from a non-sapient source.

Once [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) agrees to speak with the characters, he is forthright and shares the following:

- He was recently defeated in battle by [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md). He and his hunters attacked a group of reindeer, not realizing the group was under her protection. His group was in the wrong.  
- He knows nothing of Oka's death but is sad to hear of it. He doubts any creature in his territory was involved.  
- [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) loathes the Vile Hunt.  
- Although he doesn't know who killed Oka, he suggests asking [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) at Eagles' Aerie—the albatross leader's flying followers see all.  

#### Eagles' Aerie

A forest of exceptionally tall trees lies a few hours away from Camp Greenbriar. If the characters visit the forest, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Straight, high-branched trees create a lofty canopy. Broad nests and tree houses hide among the branches. Below, small forest creatures scamper across shadowed trails.
^11e

Any of the sapient birds who make their home in Eagles' Aerie can direct the characters to their leader, [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md). Currently, the albatross is at a meeting place called Watcher's Talon, deep in the forest. The most direct route to the site takes 2 hours. Unless a character succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, they follow a winding route that takes twice as long.

On reaching Watcher's Talon, the characters find a petrified, leafless tree. Here the giant albatross [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) holds court with a congress of winged creatures—sapient [eagles](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/eagle.md), [owls](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/owl.md), [pteranodons](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/pteranodon.md), winged lizards, and more.

[Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) uses the [giant eagle](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) stat block, with the following changes:

- [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) is neutral.  
- He has an Intelligence of 16 and a Charisma of 14.  
- He speaks Common.  

#### Talking with Parvaz

[Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) is guarded and pragmatic. He seeks to create a Faunel on par with other gate-towns, where the residents trade and leverage their unique abilities.

During a conversation with the characters, [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) shares the following information:

- He knows nothing of Oka's death and doesn't particularly care.  
- The Vile Hunt rarely bothers his followers.  
- He knows where the Vile Hunt lairs, but he doesn't know why he should share that information.  

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) to share the location of the Vile Hunt's camp. Otherwise, the characters need to make sharing this information worth [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md)'s while. [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md) would be interested in the [figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl)](Mechanics/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power-serpentine-owl.md) [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) offered the characters. He's also willing to accept a gift at a later date, at which point he sends agents to see if the characters have anything he'd be interested in.

Once the characters have struck a deal with [Parvaz](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/parvaz-tofw.md), he shares the location of the Vile Hunt.

#### Pursuing the Vile Hunt

The Vile Hunt gnolls lurk in a clearing a half-day's travel from Camp Greenbriar. If the characters bring this information to [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) or [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md), the first leader they speak to offers the characters 2,000 gp worth of gemstones to participate in a raid. They also send friendly animals equal to the number of characters. [Ebonclaw](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ebonclaw-tofw.md) sends [dire wolves](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md), and [Ophelia](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/ophelia-tofw.md) sends [rhinoceroses](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/rhinoceros.md).

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 8.1: Vile Hunt Camp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/032-map-2.03-vile-hunt-camp.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/033-map-2.03-vile-hunt-camp-player.webp#gallery)

#### Vile Hunt Camp

The Vile Hunt's camp is depicted on map 8.1. Read the following when the characters reach the camp:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The smell of charred meat fills a disorderly camp hidden between tangled woodlands and a rugged cliff. Bedrolls, cages, and drying racks with stretched animal skins cluster around smoldering bonfires. At the camp's rear, a filthy tarp covers a large cage.
^122

Mick Mangehide, the [gnoll fang of Yeenoghu](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-fang-of-yeenoghu.md) who leads the Vile Hunt, camps here with four hunters (use the [gnoll pack lord](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll-pack-lord.md) stat block). They attack as soon as they see any outsiders, and they fight to the death. One hunter stays near the cage at the rear of the camp. After 1 round, the hunter opens the cage and releases the panicked [triceratops](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/triceratops.md) inside.

##### Triceratops

The triceratops uses its Trampling Charge trait as often as it can, attacking a random creature every round. A character who spends an action and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check can direct the dinosaur to flee from the camp toward the south.

##### Treasure

Among the filthy gear is a sack containing three [potions of healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) and 1,400 gp. The cages are empty except for one holding a lengthy snakeskin that functions as a [rope of entanglement](Mechanics/items/rope-of-entanglement.md).

### Conclusion

The chapter concludes when the characters leave Faunel or when they have defeated the Vile Hunt. If the characters return to any of the leaders of the animal groups, the leaders commend the characters' actions and provide them any promised rewards. Razak also thanks the characters for their help and gifts them his [ring of animal influence](Mechanics/items/ring-of-animal-influence.md).

Once the chapter concludes, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the characters determine their next destination.

## Chapter 9–Glorium: Heroes of the Day

he gate-town of Glorium rings with songs of glory. In the bay beyond the town swirls a great whirlpool that regularly swallows and disgorges ships. This is the gate to Ysgard, where the characters must bring the Mosaic Mimir.

Glorium is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![Whirlwyrms attack the livi...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/034-02-009.courier.webp#center "Whirlwyrms attack the living ship, Courier, in the whirlpool-portal to Ysgard")

### Exploring Glorium

When the character near Glorium, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Songs and shouts rise over a sturdy-looking town between snowy mountains at the mouth of a bay churning with rough waters. In the surrounding fields, warriors and martial artists hone their skills. As you near, your mimir chimes as its eyes brim with a swirling, blue-green light.
^128

The people of Glorium are a hearty lot. Locals can offer directions anywhere the characters want to go, but some might make a good-natured demand for a contest first (see the following section). If the characters ask about the gate to Ysgard, residents point them to the docks (see the "Gate to Ysgard" section).

#### Contests

The people of Glorium delight in good-natured competitions. Treat these competitions as a series of three ability checks. If a character succeeds on two or more of the three ability checks, they win. If a character fails on two or more ability checks, their opponent wins. The Glorium Contests table lists several competitions along with a suggested DC and ability check to use in competitions against Glorium's residents, which you can use as inspiration for contests of your own.

#### Gate to Ysgard

The gate to Ysgard is a maelstrom a mile offshore. Characters directed to the gate can see it in the distance from Glorium's docks. Spells like [fly](Mechanics/spells/fly.md) or [water walk](Mechanics/spells/water-walk.md) can help characters reach the gate, but getting close enough to update their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) is a damp, miserable experience that attracts the attention of whirlwyrms (see the "Whirlwyrm Attack" section).

Hiring a boat to sail to the portal is less treacherous. If the characters ask locals about hiring a boat or wander the docks, they'll meet Bkol Steelbane, captain of the *Courier*.

#### Courier

Bkol Steelbane (chaotic good, orc [veteran](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md)) is a lanky sailor and one of two captains of the *Courier*. The other captain is the *Courier* itself, as the vessel is an amalgam of longship and joke-loving, sapient giant raven. The pair has been ferrying folks through the portal to Ysgard for years.

#### Passage to the Maelstrom

Bkol and the *Courier* have recently returned from Ysgard and are willing to sail to the portal. Bkol charges 100 gp for the ride, but he allows the characters free passage if one of them beats him in a sea-urchin-eating contest. This contest (see the "Contests" section) requires a participating character to succeed on at least two DC 17 Constitution ability checks. Even if a character loses, they earn Bkol's respect, and he reduces his price to 50 gp.

Once Bkol and the *Courier* are hired, they and their crew of eight rowers (chaotic good [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) are ready to leave at the characters' convenience.

### Whirlwyrm Attack

Reaching the gate to Ysgard by boat takes an hour. As the characters near the maelstrom, a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices two serpentine shapes in the water. These are deadly giant eels known as whirlwyrms (use the [giant crocodile](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) stat block). If no character notices the whirlwyrms, the characters and all the sailors on the *Courier* are surprised when the eels burst from the water—one on each side of the ship—and attack. A [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) dives underwater and flees if it is reduced to 10 or fewer hit points.

If the characters didn't journey to the whirlpool using the *Courier*, the whirlwyrms still attack, rising 10 feet out of the water to snap at the characters.

#### Battle on the Courier

Map 9.1 depicts the *Courier*. The bird-boat has the following features:

- **Crew.** Bkol and the ship's rowers stay out of battle, trying to keep the ship on course.  
- **Movement.** The Courier moves 40 feet away from any creature in the water each round. The whirlwyrms use all but 10 feet of their movement to keep pace with the ship.  
- **Wing Sails.** The Courier's wings are "difficult terrain". Any creature on a wing that takes 10 or more damage must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the water.  

Once the whirlwyrms are defeated, a character can update the Mosaic Mimir with a report on Glorium.

### Saga of the Whirlwyrm

Whether aboard the *Courier* or back on shore, the unusual nature of a [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) attack becomes clear. If the characters haven't met Bkol, he witnessed their encounter with the whirlwyrms and approaches. The captain is shocked to see whirlwyrms, as they typically hunt near Grakenok, a bariaur community across the bay. If the whirlwyrms are moving into the bay, Bkol suspects that something has happened to the bariaurs.

Bkol shares his concern with the characters and asks them to come with him to meet Tyrza Bonebreaker, Glorium's leader.

#### Hero among Heroes

Read the following when the characters find Tyrza:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You come across Tyrza Bonebreaker shot-putting a laughing halfling into the air. The halfling fellow soars over twenty feet, nearly overshooting bales of wool in the town circle. A cheer rises from the motley crowd surrounding Tyrza, who shrugs and laughs.
> 
> The leader of Glorium strands well over six feet tall, with an artistically etched prosthetic arm and an impressive collection of tattoos covering her copper-colored skin. She notices Bkol as he approaches and gives a friendly shout: "Bkol! Back from the land of legends! Glad to see we keep you coming back!"
^131

Tyrza Bonebreaker (chaotic good, human [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md); "detailed further" in "Sigil and the Outlands") is loud, powerful, and free with her feelings and praise. She's fond of Bkol, and listens as he encourages the characters to recount the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) attack. When he's done reporting, Tyrza says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Whirlwyrms! Lost villagers! Certain peril! Hear that, Glorium?" Tyrza booms. "It sounds like we're in need of heroes!"
> 
> Around her, the people of Glorium go wild with cheers and the shouts of volunteers. Tyrza points dramatically at two heroic-looking locals, then turns to Bkol. "And what about you and your crew here, Bkol? You up to saving someone's world?"
^132

Bkol leaves the choice up to the characters. If asked what's going on, Bkol explains that Glorium is a town full of glory seekers and that Tyrza rewards those who serve the gate-town. Bkol assures the characters it's worth their while if they offer aid.

If the characters agree to go to Grakenok and find out what's happening, Bkol ferries them free of charge. Tyrza bids them a glorious adventure.

#### The Competition

The characters aren't the only heroes headed to Grakenok. These two rivals also step up and seek to find out what's happened at Grakenok:

- **Sytri.** A silent, masked woman wearing Doomguard armor, Sytri is a chaotic good [Doomguard rot blade](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/doomguard-rot-blade-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). She unfurls a [carpet of flying](Mechanics/items/carpet-of-flying-3-ft-5-ft.md) measuring 3 feet by 5 feet and woven with the image of a flying demon skull.  
- **Tol Frostmane.** Full of flattery and bravo, Tol is a towering [equinal guardinal](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/equinal-guardinal-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") with a neatly braided black mane and a loose poet's shirt. He sails a swift sailboat called the Allure.  

Both heroes are respectful toward the characters but defend themselves if attacked.

#### Off to Adventure

Sytri and Tol want to be the first to find out what's happening in Grakenok, and Bkol encourages the characters to act swiftly to keep up with them. Sytri and Tol set off immediately, using their [carpet of flying](Mechanics/items/carpet-of-flying-3-ft-5-ft.md) and ship, respectively. The characters can travel to Grakenok however they like. It would take their walking castle days to circle the bay and reach Grakenok, so Bkol offers them use of the *Courier*.

As with all places in the Outlands, the distance between Glorium and Grakenok varies. How long the journey takes is up to you, but so long as the characters don't pause for any amount of time longer than a short rest, they arrive in Grakenok at about the same time as their rivals. The events in the "Perils at Sea" section might also delay the characters or their rivals.

### Perils at Sea

Use the following encounters to add peril to the characters' journey.

#### Lost Dingy

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher see the following scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the distance, you can see a dingy being tossed by the bay's choppy waters. The vessel seems to be taking on water, sinking into the waves. You can make out one small occupant on the craft.
^137

The sailor in the dingy is a human youngster in danger. Changing course to save the ship delays the characters' arrival in Grakenok (see the "Arriving in Grakenok" section).

The characters might be traveling close enough to Sytri or Tol that the other hero can hear them. A character who points out the floundering ship to the other hero and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check convinces their rival to investigate the boat, delaying that hero's arrival in Grakenok.

The dingy is doomed, but its lone sailor is easily saved. This precocious human [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) calls himself Kai and is impressed by whoever rescued him. Kai might be either a young thrill seeker from Glorium or the Lemming Boy (see the ""Glorium"" section of "Sigil and the Outlands").

If no one tries to save the dingy, both it and its occupant eventually fade from view and don't reappear.

#### Whirlwyrm Spotted

A giant splash reveals another [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) (use the [giant crocodile](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) stat block) swimming near the characters. If sailing characters want to sneak by the creature, they must succeed on a DC 10 group Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check, or the monster notices them and attacks. If the characters engage the creature in combat, they're delayed in arriving at Grakenok (see the "Arriving in Grakenok" section).

A character who calls out to a nearby rival and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can convince the rival to fight the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md), which delay's that hero's arrival in Grakenok.

### Arriving in Grakenok

Determine the order in which the characters and their rivals arrive at Grakenok. The characters, Sytri, and Tol would reach the town at the same time, but each arrives 1 round later for each time they were delayed during the "Perils at Sea" section. This order influences events in the following sections.

If the characters took a long rest or made a lengthy detour after Sytri and Tol left Glorium, the characters arrive in Grakenok after their rivals have already defeated the threat there. Proceed with the "Victory at Grakenok" section.

### Beast of Grakenok

When Grakenok comes into sight, read or paraphrase the description below. If Sytri or Tol reached Grakenok before the characters, they are already engaged in battle.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> With its colorful homes and varied goat and sea-serpent carvings, the village of Grakenok would look cozy were it not being attacked by a behemoth [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md). Over thirty feet long, the giant eel towers over the town's few bariaur defenders, smashing fishing boats and cottages in its rampage.
^13b

The bariaurs of Grakenok have put up a heroic defense of their home. They've been suffering [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) attacks for days, culminating in an assault by a massive elder [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md). This [giant whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/giant-whirlwyrm-tofw.md) uses the [behir](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/behir.md) stat block with these adjustments:

- Replace its climbing speed with a swimming speed of 60 feet. It slithers swiftly on land and retains its 50-foot walking speed.  
- Change its lightning breath to deal thunder damage. This represents its discombobulating roar.  

The enraged [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) fights to the death.

![Map 9.1: Courier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/035-map-2.04-courier.webp#center)

#### Four-Way Battle

The characters, [Sytri](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/doomguard-rot-blade-mpp.md), and [Tol](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/equinal-guardinal-mpp.md) all seek the glory of defeating the elder [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md). Track how much damage each character and the rival heroes deal to the monster every round. Instead of rolling damage, Sytri and Tol both deal 10 damage to the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) on each of their turns. For every round by which a rival hero beats the characters to Grakenok (if any), that hero has already dealt 10 damage to the monster. If the characters beat Sytri or Tol to Grakenok, the rival heroes enter battle as soon as they arrive.

Sytri and Tol focus on the monster and ignore the characters unless the party attacks them first.

### Victory at Grakenok

When the elder [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) is defeated, the bariaurs of Grakenok laud the heroes who saved them. They treat whoever dealt the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) the most damage as the true hero, though—whether this be one of the characters, Sytri, or Tol. To this true hero, the bariaurs present one of the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md)'s foot-long fangs. If a character wins, Sytri and Tol prove to be graceful competitors and congratulate the victor.

### Conclusion

On their return to Glorium, the characters are greeted by Tyrza and locals who want to know everything that happened. If a character brings back the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) fang the bariaurs gave them, Tyrza recognizes that character as the Hero of the Day. She also rewards that character with a [silver horn of Valhalla](Mechanics/items/horn-of-valhalla-silver.md) and your choice of one of the following treasures:

- A wide-brimmed [hat of disguise](Mechanics/items/hat-of-disguise.md)  
- A [+1 weapon](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) once wielded by Tyrza's father, Flatnose Grim  
- A [cloak of protection](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-protection.md) embroidered with patterns of bariaur travelers  

Tyrza then hosts a daylong feast in the character's honor.

If no character returned with the [whirlwyrm](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/whirlwyrm-tofw.md) fang, Tyrza invites them to the feast she throws for whoever did. Bkol then thanks the characters for the adventure and rewards them with three feathers from the *Courier*. These function as three random [Quaal's feather tokens](Mechanics/items/quaals-feather-token-dmg.md).

Once the chapter concludes, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 10–Rigus: Eternity's Rampart

The gate-town of Rigus is under siege. Brutal attacks through the portal to Acheron have pinpointed the town's weaknesses and worn its defenders down. If the characters wish to access the gate to Acheron, they'll have to help the gate-town's defenders discover how their foes strike with such uncanny precision.

Rigus is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![An ettin warlord emerges t...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/036-02-010.ettin-warlord.webp#center "An ettin warlord emerges through the gate to Acheron, leading an invasion of Rigus")

### Approaching Rigus

As the characters approach Rigus, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From a flat, dusty plain rises a seven-tiered hill girded by ring after ring of iron battlements. Towers and siege engines bristle across these rising walls, and even from a distance, you can make out regimented patrols of armored figures. Simple structures and homes squeeze between the town's daunting fortifications. Your mimir chimes as you draw closer, its glowing eyes pulsing in time with a distant drumbeat.
^141

If the characters draw near Rigus in their walking castle, the gate-town's defenders believe they're under attack, as detailed in the following section. Otherwise, proceed with the "Entering Rigus" section.

#### Attack on Rigus

> [!quote] A quote from Captain Timoroth Brezd, Rigus soldier  
> 
> "Do as I say, and you won't have any problems."

The sight of a walking castle closing on the gate-town puts all of Rigus on alert. Blaring horns precede every gate into town closing and patrols outside the gate-town converging into a small army in the walking castle's path. Moments later, a [Harmonium captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/harmonium-captain-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") who imbibed a [potion of flying](Mechanics/items/potion-of-flying.md) approaches the walking castle. When the captain is close enough to be heard, read or paraphrase the following boxed text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A human solider wearing rust-red plate armor flies through the air. He comes to a halt, hovering several dozen feet away from the walking castle. "I am Corporal Piang Shu, representative of the Crown Generals of Rigus," he shouts in a commanding voice. "Declare yourselves, and remove your war machine beyond sight of Rigus's highest tower. Otherwise, we will defend ourselves with full martial force!"
^143

By pleading their case and succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can convince Shu they don't intend to attack Rigus. Shu's demand to remove the walking castle is nonnegotiable, though, and the distance he insists on is a day's travel away. The Castellan can drop the characters off, then move the castle without them.

Once the misunderstanding is clarified, Shu has the town's forces stand down, escorts the characters to the entrance to Rigus, and then departs.

#### Entering Rigus

Read or paraphrase the following description as the characters near the entrance to Rigus:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Soldiers wearing plate armor stop those attempting to enter the gate-town. While soldiers are waved through with a few words, others undergo more rigorous questioning. Most are given some sort of badge and move on, while a few others are brusquely escorted away.
^145

Ten lawful neutral [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) guard the entrance to Rigus. The guards ask each character a few questions:

- Have you come to join the army of Rigus or proceed on to wars in Acheron?  
- What is your business in Rigus?  
- Do you have any weapons of interplanar destruction to declare?  

If a character answers truthfully, or lies and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check, the guards grant the character a gray badge that can be worn as a pin or medallion. A guard explains that the badge identifies the character as a visitor and must be worn at all times. Anyone found not wearing a gray badge is removed from town.

The guards are humorless. Any character who tries to avoid the guards or who makes light of their questioning is subjected to an hour of thorough but frivolous questioning before being admitted.

### The Sealed Gate

Once inside, the characters can explore Rigus. Any patrolling soldier can curtly direct the characters to the gate to Acheron. The path to the gate, which lies beneath Rigus's hill, is accessible from the highest district. Reaching the gate involves a winding walk of over a mile from the town's entrance.

On reaching the gate, the characters find it sealed by an intimidating iron gate guarded by eight lawful neutral [knights](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md). These guards are under orders not to admit "slates"—slang for nonmilitary folk who wear slate-gray badges. A character who demands to see the guards' superior is directed to Major Kalar, who has a command tent nearby.

#### Meeting Major Kalar

If the characters follow the guards' directions, they arrive at a field covered in simple command tents. It takes 15 minutes to find Major Kalar's white tent amid the bustle of officers and messengers. When the characters enter the tent, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stony-faced hobgoblin woman in a sharp-looking uniform looks up from a desk covered in neat stacks of papers and folded envelopes. Her brow furrows. "This isn't the welcome center, slates. March on."
^148

Major Nirra Kalar (lawful neutral, hobgoblin [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) is busy and not eager to be interrupted. If the characters explain themselves, she listens. Use the following points to guide the conversation:

- The portal to Acheron is closed after a series of deadly attacks from the gate's far side.  
- Assaults from Acheron are common, but these attacks have been highly effective and have caught Rigus's defenders off guard each time.  
- Extra troops now defend the gate, but the attacks exploit every shift change and flawed positioning.  
- Kalar fears a spy is in Rigus's midst.  
- If the characters can prove they have any sort of martial aptitude, Kalar offers to hire them to seek out how the forces through the gate are getting intel on Rigus's defenses.  

If the characters agree to help end the threat, the major promises them access to the gate to Acheron, 1,000 gp each, and their choice of equipment from the Rigus officer's armory (detailed in the "Conclusion"). Once Kalar and the characters come to an arrangement, she can escort them to the gate to Acheron when they're ready.

### Acheron Incursion

Reaching the gate to Acheron involves following a long tunnel to a massive mechanical lift. So long as the characters are with Major Kalar, the town guards don't impede them.

Read or paraphrase the following description when the characters reach the gate:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Within a cavernous, steel-lined bunker deep below Rigus stands the gate to Acheron, an archway of iron spikes and bone. The area around the gate looks like a battlefield and is littered with heaps of broken metal and shattered armaments. A ring of barricades circles the gate, beyond which at least two hundred Rigus soldiers maintain a rigid, watchful formation.
^14a

#### Rigus Forces

Rigus's forces are largely hobgoblin and human [guards](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md). Two commanders oversee these troops:

- **Sergeant Gauller.** A quick-to-smile, lawful neutral [cambion](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/cambion.md), Gauller welcomes the characters' help but has no idea why foes from Acheron are attacking so aggressively. Gauller is wary of being targeted by the enemy and has a spellcaster in his service cast [nondetection](Mechanics/spells/nondetection.md) on him every 8 hours.  
- **Sergeant Luggik.** Luggik looks like an armored human woman and behaves like a veteran solider. In fact, the real Luggik was replaced by a [gray slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gray-slaad.md) (see the following section) that wears a [ring of mind shielding](Mechanics/items/ring-of-mind-shielding.md). The slaad has blended in with Rigus's forces and learned much about the gate-town's defenses.  

Kalar introduces the characters to both sergeants. While the soldiers are polite, they both have duties to perform and are watchful of the gate.

#### Invaders' Methods

The invading Acheron forces serve a warlord named Thalir Heartbane, a goblin warlord favored by the god Maglubiyet. Recently, an ettin servant of Thalir with heads named Zot and Sotu came into possession of a gray slaad's control gem (see the "Monster Manual"). The gray slaad uses its Shapechanger trait to pose as Sergeant Luggik. During assaults through the portal, the slaad uses telepathy to relate information to Zot and Sotu's agents, who then slip back through the portal. This helps the invaders prepare ever-deadlier attacks.

#### Before Battle

The characters can inspect the gate to Acheron or speak to any of the soldiers at the gate. Major Kalar won't let the characters attune the Mosaic Mimir to the portal, though, insisting they fulfill their deal with her first. There's little evidence to discover, but the soldiers reinforce the direness of their situation and convey their dread of the next attack. When the characters are done investigating, proceed with the following section.

### Acheron Attacks

When the attack from Acheron comes, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The gate to Acheron flares to life, the portal resembling a great, burning feline eye. Gigantic, conical projectiles—each made of rusted iron and over fifteen feet long—blast through the gate in rapid succession, impacting amid Rigus's defenders. Soldiers scream and barricades shatter. Then a wave of berserk invaders charges through the gate.
^14f

In moments, dozens of Rigus guards and berserkers from Acheron clash in battle. Three massive projectiles—slivers of the great iron cubes that make up the plane beyond—and their impact craters mar the battlefield.

This battlefield is keyed to map 10.1. The characters start anywhere in the southernmost 10 feet of the map. Five neutral evil human and goblin [berserkers](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) near the gate notice the characters and attack. Those foes fight to the death.

The characters' allies—like Major Kalar, Sergeant Gauller, and the fake Sergeant Luggik—hold their own elsewhere on the battlefield.

#### Gate to Acheron Battlefield Features

The battlefield around the gate to Acheron has the following features:

- **Barricades.** Any Large or smaller creature that attempts to move over one of these barricades must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If it fails, the creature doesn't cross the barricade, and its speed is 0 until the end of the turn.  
- **Difficult Terrain.** The heaps of debris and the impact craters surrounding the Acheron projectiles are "difficult terrain".  

#### Gate to Acheron Battlefield Events

During this battle, roll on the Gate to Acheron Battlefield Events table each round on initiative count 0. Also consider rolling on the table if a character tries to leave the mapped battlefield.

**Gate to Acheron Battlefield Events**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^gate-to-acheron-battlefield-events)`

| dice: d10 | Event |
|-----------|-------|
| 1–3 | A random character sees something suspicious, such as Sergeant Luggik not striking a foe or a foe shielding her from a blow. |
| 4–5 | A hostile [berserker](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to the map's edge near a random character. |
| 6–9 | A stray heavy crossbow bolt targets a random character. The attack has a +4 bonus to hit and deals 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage on a hit. |
| 10 | A 10-foot-wide, iron projectile blasts from the gate to Acheron along the path that affects the greatest number of characters. Creatures in the projectile's path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
^gate-to-acheron-battlefield-events

#### Midbattle Deductions

During the battle, a character can spend an action to watch for something unusual. If they do, the character makes a DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. If the check is successful, the character notices "Sergeant Luggik" stage fighting with a foe who clearly doesn't intend her harm. Unbeknownst to the character, the fake Luggik is using telepathy to relate information to this spy mid-battle.

If called out for this, the fake Luggik appears at the map's edge near a random character and stalls until the second wave of battle. If attacked or impeded, the [gray slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gray-slaad.md) assumes its true form and tries to escape through the gate.

#### Second Wave

After the berserkers are defeated, the characters have 1 round to recover. If no character has already noticed Luggik's behavior, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices Luggik's mock fighting, as noted above. At the end of this round, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The portal to Acheron flares again, and three two-headed giants stride through. One wears plates of armor riddled with spikes. From one of its helmets glints a gray gemstone.
^154

Three ettins emerge through the portal. Two use the stat blocks of normal [ettins](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/ettin.md), but the third is Zot and Sotu, who are an [ettin](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) with an Armor Class of 16.

Any character who observes the gray gem and succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check recognizes it as a slaad control gem: a stone that gives the wearer control over a slaad. A second successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check also allows a character to realize that some slaadi can change shape.

If Zot and Sotu are reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, they call for aid. If the fake Luggik hasn't reverted to its [gray slaad](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/gray-slaad.md) form, she does so now and appears on the battlefield as noted above.

### Conclusion

The characters might have pieced together that Luggik was replaced by a slaad spy. If they didn't, Major Kalar notices the control gem on Zot and Sotu's armor and makes suggestions until the characters have the gist of the details from the "Invaders' Methods" section.

Major Kalar then grants the characters access to the gate to Acheron. Afterward, she leads the characters to the officer's armory, from which each character can choose one of the following magic items:

- [+1 weapon](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) of any type from the "Player's Handbook"  
- [+1 wand of the war mage](Mechanics/items/1-wand-of-the-war-mage.md)  
- [Cloak of protection](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-protection.md)  
- [Dimensional shackles](Mechanics/items/dimensional-shackles.md)  

Kalar sees the characters paid and thanks them before heading off to file a lengthy report.

After this, consult "Advancing in Level" in chapter 4 and let the party determine their next destination.

## Chapter 11–Sylvania: Titan on the Town

Sylvania, gate-town to Arborea, lies in the embrace of a mystical forest. Ephemeral lights drift along mossy streets, and whimsical architecture complements a wilderness of ageless trees, talking vegetation, and colorful toadstools. Sylvania's gate is unique among the gate-towns, as it shifts locations around the community, confounding efforts to locate it. Further complicating the characters' efforts in town, a powerful being who has reached an emotional tipping point has become a problem for the community.

Sylvania is detailed in "chapter 3" of "Sigil and the Outlands". Review the town's description prior to running this chapter.

![The revels of Kopoha the e...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/039-02-011.kopoha.webp#center "The revels of Kopoha the empyrean get out of hand in the gate-town of Sylvania")

### Exploring Sylvania

As the characters approach Sylvania, read or paraphrase the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Merriment and music fill the air beneath a canopy of colorful foliage. Marvelous buildings encircle the trees or are built amid their spreading boughs. Passing revelers wave and offer you crowns woven of fresh, colorful flowers. As they do, your mimir chimes, and its eyes twinkle in rainbow hues.
^158

Sylvania's residents welcome the characters and can answer questions about locations in the town and the gate (see the following section).

As the characters explore the gate-town, any of the events on the Sylvania Encounters table might occur.

> [!quote] A quote from King Ewren III of Ewrendar, a pixie kingdom in Sylvania  
> 
> "I said I'm coming! I just need to say a few words about the gate-town for this mimir fellow first. Hold on wait–wait. Who's here? And they're doing what?! Yooooo–that's epic level! Let's goooo!"

**Sylvania Encounters**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^sylvania-encounters)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Today is Prince Philnixius Bombo's birthday, and a group of enthusiastic revelers ([commoners](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) invite the characters to share birthday wishes. The prince is a [quipper](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/quipper.md) wearing a tiny hat in a floating punch bowl full of violet liquid. |

^sylvania-encounters

#### Gate to Arborea

The gate to Arborea lies in the woods near Sylvania, but it changes location randomly, rarely settling in a location for more than a day. Locals can explain the gate's wandering nature, but they can't locate it. The only beings who always know the gate's location are the ephemeral rulers of Sylvania: the Seven Spiritors. Usually the spiritors are busy overseeing festivities in town, but as luck would have it, one of them has need of the characters.

### A Titanic Problem

Among the endless celebrations ongoing throughout the gate-town, the scion of a god is nursing a crushing defeat and is on the verge of making it everyone's problem. As the characters are exploring Sylvania, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A booming, furious voice followed by a peel of thunder cuts through the din of laughter and celebration. Nearby celebrants turn from their revels to look in the voice's direction, while others relocate their festivities. One of these locals approaches you—a satyr in an airy gown, whose eyes glow with tangerine light.
^15b

This is Spiritor Danai, a spirit of revelry who is inhabiting the body of a willing host, a [satyr](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) named Kallista. Danai is chaotic good, friendly, and unflappably optimistic. As she approaches, each character becomes aware of the spiritor's name and her nature as a bodiless spirit and leader of the gate-town. Danai greats the characters, asks if they're enjoying themselves, and inquires about their business in town. Whether the characters ask about the yelling or she has to bring up the matter herself, she also shares the following information:

- The ruckus is coming from a despondent [empyrean](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md): [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md), the Celestial child of a god of storms who is trying to crash a private event.  
- Empyreans are creatures of incredible power and overwhelming emotion.  
- Should [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s dark mood grows much stronger, she might become a danger to the town.  
- If the characters distract [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) from the event at the Yearning Timbers event hall, Danai will lead the characters to the gate to Arborea.  
- Danai doesn't know the cause of the empyrean's foul mood, but there are celebrations aplenty in town where the characters might lighten [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s mood.  

#### Meeting Kopoha

When the characters seek out [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md), they find her in the following scene:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An eighteen-foot-tall, humanlike woman with marble skin and eyes crackling with lightning crouches to agitatedly argue with a calm, silver-haired elf. Beyond the elf is a rollicking celebration taking place inside a towering banyan tree strobing with colored lights.
^15d

[Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) (chaotic good [empyrean](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) without a Maul attack) argues with an elf named Manalath (neutral good [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)), who's respectfully preventing the empyrean from entering the Yearning Timbers. Inside is a rare, invite-only event being hosted by Rillifane Rallathil, an elf god of nature. Manalath apologizes and calmly repeats that [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) isn't on the guest list. As [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) grows more insistent, winds carrying the scent of a thunderstorm rise around the pair.

The argument continues until the characters intervene. Any interruption catches [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) off guard. She sizes up the characters and says, "I suppose you're not completely unworthy of my time. Why do you approach [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)?" Her demeanor is challenging but not hostile.

A character can talk [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) away from the Yearning Timbers through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. Characters who flatter [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) have advantage on this check.

Once the characters convince [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) to leave the Yearning Timbers, they need someplace to take her; otherwise, she returns to arguing with Manalath.

#### Kopoha's Bad Day

[Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) recently endured a crushing defeat by her bitterest rival, her sister Alethira. The two are always trying to outdo each other as they vie for their parents' approval. They are usually well matched, but this time Alethira humiliated [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) by beating her at cards and taking her maul as a prize. This defeat exacerbated the worries [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) harbors (see the following section). She's trying to bury her worries by recklessly celebrating in Sylvania.

#### Titanic Pain

In situations noted later in this chapter, [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) might share the following truths and a quandary about her life:

- **Familial Expectations.** [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s parents expect her to become a god one day. They're constantly watching her and judging whether she's good enough for godhood. That's a lot to live up to! How do the characters think she can ever live up to the expectations of literal gods?  
- **Sibling Jealousy.** [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) thinks her sister, Alethira, is amazing at everything. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) respects her sister but feels she has to prove to her parents that she's just as worthy a daughter and future god. How do the characters think she can be a loving sister while proving she's just as amazing as Alethira?  
- **Divine Insecurity.** [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) dreads becoming a god. She doesn't even know herself yet. What if she becomes a god of the sea? She hates seafood! Or what if she becomes god of something embarrassing, like smelly winds? It's a big deal for an immortal! What do the characters think she should be god of?  

How characters react to these confessions affects how [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s visit to Sylvania ends (see the "Closing Time" section).

### Celebrations in Sylvania

Revelry is in no short supply in Sylvania. Characters looking for celebrations or distractions in the gate-town might stumble across or be directed to the events in this section. Use the events you think the characters will enjoy, in any order.

#### Dryad Dance

In a clearing lit by energetic fireflies, a group of ten [dryads](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) sings and dances. The group welcomes anyone who comes in peace to enjoy the serenity of their trees. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) eagerly participates, but her size makes her a menace to smaller dancers. While [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) is dancing, a character must keep those around the empyrean safe, perhaps by maneuvering her around the dance floor with a successful DC 14 ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

If the characters fail at helping [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) dance safely, she accidentally knocks over some dryads or damages a tree. Embarrassed, the empyrean insists on leaving immediately.

If the characters succeed, [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) has a great time and dances for an hour. While taking a break, she shares one of the truths from the "Titanic Pain" section. Afterward, she's ready to move on to another celebration.

#### Pixie Parade

> [!quote] A quote from Tyuffayn Tinilyn, pixie celebrant (known as "Faerie Fire" but not for the reasons you think)  
> 
> "This song's about me!"

The [pixies](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) of Goodberry Grove party hard, and their party is in full swing. Wine, juice, and fruit desserts flow along with music and laughter among the toadstools. If the characters enter the party, they're shrunk down to pixie size, while [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) becomes the size of a halfling. This delights the empyrean, and she tests her strength by picking up tiny mushroom structures or visiting forest animals. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s feats and boasting quickly irritate the pixies. A character can make this more entertaining by succeeding on a DC 12 Charisma ([Performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance)) check or by otherwise casting [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s efforts as charming.

If the characters fail to compensate for [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s boasting, the pixies ask the characters and the empyrean to leave.

If the characters succeed, the pixies encourage [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md). She insists on taking a break after an hour. While doing so, she shares one of the truths from the "Titanic Pain" section. Afterward, [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) wants to move on to a new party.

#### Skull Bocce

Amid a field of memorials, a retired god of the dead and a retinue of skeletons and morbidly dressed competitors play a casual, good-natured game of bocce. The god (perhaps Jergal, an apathetic former god of death) invites [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) and the characters to play, but instead of normal balls, they're using the skulls of the group's skeletons. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) is eager to play but is both bad at the game (which she's never played) and far too competitive for this group. She might also attempt to use the Mosaic Mimir as a ball—which doesn't harm it but might make some characters anxious. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to help [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) either win or deal with her loss gracefully.

If the characters fail, [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) throws a tantrum that annoys the god. The god insists [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) and the group leave, or their skulls will be used for the next game.

If the characters succeed, the game goes well, but eventually the god decides to move on. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) takes a break and shares one of the truths from the "Titanic Pain" section. Afterward, she wants to move on to a new party.

> [!quote] A quote from Ose Obol-Eyes, merrenoloth ferryman and skull bocce champion  
> 
> "My guy, I get it. We've all got some afterlife or eternity or obliteration to get to, but right now, I'm on break. Now, watch this throw."

#### Widow's Henge

In a silent glade, a ring of standing stones surrounds a fallen menhir. The toppled rock is laden with an inviting but unattended feast. Any local or a character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check knows that this is Widow's Henge and that anyone who eats from the stone vanishes.

A character can dare [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) to eat a portion of the feast by succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. If a character knows the legends about Widow's Henge, this is abjectly not a good act and could affect the character's alignment. If [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) eats from the feast, she vanishes the next time she is out of the characters' sight and doesn't return. The same happens to any character who eats from the feast, but the character's incarnation reappears after an hour with no memory of what happened.

#### Other Celebrations

There are countless other celebrations around Sylvania. Use the events here and challenges like those outlined in the "Contests" section of chapter 9 to create more festivities and chances for [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) to confide in the characters.

### Closing Time

The characters' celebrations with [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) might end in the following ways:

- **Chance to Think.** After [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) shares all the information from the "Titanic Pain" section, she grows introspective. She thanks the characters and tells them she has decided to go talk to her sister, Alethira, about what's on her mind. Before [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) departs, she gives the characters a [periapt of wound closure](Mechanics/items/periapt-of-wound-closure.md) that resembles her face.  
- **Missing Titan.** If [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) goes missing while celebrating with the characters, Danai is displeased but upholds her end of their deal. Afterward, the spiritor asks the characters never to return to Sylvania.  
- **Titan's Rage.** If the characters mock [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s feelings or encourage self-indulgent behavior, the rampage Spiritor Danai feared comes to pass. [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md)'s trail of destruction eventually leads out of town, and she's not seen in Sylvania again. This disappoints Danai, but she helps the characters find the gate to Arborea nevertheless.  

### Conclusion

Danai finds the characters soon after [Kopoha](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/kopoha-tofw.md) departs and leads the characters to the gate to Arborea. The portal currently resides in an overgrown well in the forest outside town. The spiritor then returns to Sylvania to attend to other ongoing parties. If the characters are still in Danai's good graces, she might invite them to join her for one more celebration.

When the characters are ready to leave Sylvania, consult the "Advancing in Level" section of chapter 4 and let the characters determine their next destination.

## Chapter 12–Outlands Explorations

This chapter presents encounters for use while characters explore the Outlands. These events aren't vital to the adventure and can be used in any order. Some reinforce recurring themes in the adventure, while others are exciting digressions. Use these events and the "encounter tables" in "Morte's Planar Parade" to further develop the Outlands. These events don't influence when characters advance in level.

### Planar Glitch

The characters' incarnations are just one manifestation of the planar instability caused by the inaccurate beliefs of modrons lost in the Outlands (see chapter 15). At any point during the characters' exploration of the Outlands, they might experience one of the events on the Glitch Encounters table.

**Glitch Encounters**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^glitch-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A character within view of the Spire notices it's not rising in a straight line. Cloud cover might even make it look as though it were broken into multiple pieces. After an hour, the Spire returns to normal. |
| 2 | A [kolyarut](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/kolyarut-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") arrives to interview the characters about their strange situation. It seeks information so greater powers in Mechanus can decide whether they want to blame the characters for their reality-defying situation. |
| 3 | The characters reach a gate-town and find the last gate-town they visited in its place. To the inhabitants, everything is normal. After `1d4` days, the gate-towns return to their original locations. |
| 4 | The characters witness an illusory, miles-long procession of thousands of modrons. Any character who draws close to the illusions can see that the modrons look terrified of their surroundings. The illusion continues for an hour before vanishing. |
| 5 | The characters find a field littered with thousands of dead sunflies. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check knows that sunflies are susceptible to planar energies, but what would have killed so many is a mystery. |
| 6 | Mists rise around the walking castle. Within the mist, the characters see a duplicate of their walking castle. Before they can investigate, it vanishes. |
^glitch-encounters

### Angels in the Outlands

> [!quote] A quote from Valorlayn the Adamant, hound archon Spireball player  
> 
> "If you think you're prepared for the ultimate struggle between good and evil, the deciding contest between all that is righteous and all that is foul, then to you I say, 'Play ball!'"

Every three hundred years, Celestials and Fiends gather to play a ballgame in observance of an ancient agreement between a god and a demon lord. The victors of this match claim a priceless trophy: the fate of an innocent soul.

The encounter begins when the characters happen on the playing field. Read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A gigantic flat diamond, its three points marked with squat pedestals, shimmers within a ringed field. Celestials in radiant uniforms practice at swatting glowing orbs on one side of the field, while elephantine demons on the other side trumpet at them through barbed trunks to break their concentration.
> 
> A boxy, winged modron in a padded helmet with a face cage hovers in front of your castle. "Greetings! It appears you've stumbled on our ballgame," reports the modron. "Care to participate?"
^16b

The [quadrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md), G041, is an impartial umpire appointed to observe the ball-and-stick game, which is called Spireball. The modron happily explains the game's rules, its stakes, and the two teams, all of which are detailed below.

#### Good versus Evil

Two teams—the Noxious Stampede and the Righteous Hands—vie for a single soul in the Outlands. Both teams need players, but the characters can join only one. Alternatively, the characters can join neither and instead influence the game's outcome from afar.

#### Noxious Stampede

The Noxious Stampede consists of nine [maelephants](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). Their star pitcher, who goes by "Snot Rocket," shoots stinking balls from its trunk like a cannon. The Fiends are sore losers and insufferable winners.

#### Righteous Hands

A team of Celestials, the Righteous Hands consist of eight [hound archons](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/hound-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") and their star player, a [deva](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) named [Shariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/shariel-tofw.md) whose flanged mace rings deeply when it connects with its target. The Righteous Hands are paragons of sportsmanship and honesty, rooting for each other and never disrespecting their opponents, no matter how low the Noxious Stampede stoops.

#### Spireball Rules

![Shariel, Star Player of the Righteous Hands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/040-02-012.shariel.webp#center)

Spireball takes place on a flat, triangular diamond surrounded by a ringed field. Three low pedestals at each of the triangle's points serve as bases. The last of these, where batters take their swings, is known as home plate. During the game, batters navigate these bases in order from home plate to first base, first base to second base, and second base back to home plate. The game has the following rules.

#### Setup

The offensive team rolls initiative to determine the batting order. Meanwhile, the defensive team designates a pitcher, who stands in the middle of the triangle facing home plate; all other participants on that team are fielders.

#### Batting

On their turn, each batter makes a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. On a successful check, the batter hits the ball with their implement and sends it flying into the field, and the batter attempts to move to first base. The defensive team can try to catch the ball (see the "Catching" section).

Each batter can attempt this check up to three times; after three failed checks, the batter strikes out and must stand down, and the next batter steps up to home plate.

##### Home Run

A batter who rolls a 20 on the die hits a home run. The defending team doesn't get a chance to catch the ball, and the batter and every other team member currently on a base reach home plate.

#### Catching

If a batter hits the ball, the defensive team moves to catch it. One fielder of your choice must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. On a successful check, the batter is out and must stand down. On a failed check, the batter advances to first base, moving any other batters ahead of them forward by one base.

#### Scoring Points

Spireball has three bases corresponding to its three pedestals. Each time a batter returns from second base to home plate, their team scores 1 point.

The round ends when three batters are out, either by striking out or by having their ball caught, at which point the two teams switch places.

#### Play Ball!

Once the characters chose their team or decline, the game begins. The Righteous Hands are first to bat.

The game ends after each team has played offense and defense once. The outcome of the encounter hinges on the winning team and whether the characters assisted them.

#### Noxious Stampede Wins

If evil triumphs, members of the Noxious Stampede revel with Abyssal brags and celebratory gestures. If the characters joined this team or reveal they secretly assisted the maelephants from the sidelines, Snot Rocket produces a slimy [eversmoking bottle](Mechanics/items/eversmoking-bottle.md) and gives it to one of the characters.

#### Righteous Hands Win

If good prevails, the Righteous Hands celebrate and offer to shake hands with their opponents, who refuse the Celestials' gesture of goodwill. If the characters joined the Righteous Hands, [Shariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/shariel-tofw.md) gifts the characters with a prismatic chalice from Mount Celestia that functions as a [gem of brightness](Mechanics/items/gem-of-brightness.md).

If the characters reveal they helped the Righteous Hands from the sidelines in some way, [Shariel](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/shariel-tofw.md) still awards the chalice but shamefully notifies the modron umpire. The angel asks for a rematch in a year, adding "cheaters never truly win."

#### Tie Game

If the teams tie, the soul's fate is delayed for three hundred years. Both teams are visibly disappointed.

### Mausoleum of Chronepsis

> [!quote] A quote from Master Thief Hie Akee, before his disappearance  
> 
> "Chronepsis's Mausoleum is huge! Gigantic like no city you've ever seen. Sure, there's the dragons–and Chronepsis himself–but how many wyrms could there be? Like, a hundred? How hard could it be to steal something from a city with only a hundred folks in it?"

In these encounters, a dragon disconnected from the linear flow of time befriends the characters. Use these scenes in the following order, with the first occurring after characters visit a gate-town or two.

The encounter starts while the characters are in the walking castle. There's a boom and the castle sags, as if something heavy just landed on it. When a character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Coiled atop the walking castle is a mighty, pearl-colored dragon with branch-like horns. Its brilliant eyes fix on you. In a warm, slow voice that sounds as though it were coming from far away, it says, "My old friend. How good it is to see you again."
^17a

This is Renesnuprah, an [adult time dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/adult-time-dragon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). Renesnuprah warmly greets the characters by name and calls them friends. She can share general details about each of them. Use the following details to guide the conversation with the time dragon:

- Renesnuprah claims to know the characters from when they first met hundreds of years ago. The characters have no memory of this meeting.  
- The dragon realizes she might not have met the characters at this point in time. She doesn't elaborate, as she fears interfering with events to come.  
- Renesnuprah gives the characters a [talisman of the sphere](Mechanics/items/talisman-of-the-sphere.md) and says, "Give this to the one who sees silver." She explains the characters will understand in time.  

If attacked or driven off, the dragon is saddened but leaves behind the [talisman of the sphere](Mechanics/items/talisman-of-the-sphere.md).

![Dragons from across the pl...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/041-02-013.chronepsis.webp#center "Dragons from across the planes visit the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, seeking to learn the secrets of fate")

#### The Witch and the Wyrmling

This encounter occurs after the characters have the previous experience with Renesnuprah and visit another gate-town or two. The encounter begins while the characters are in their walking castle, and they hear a panicked cry from outside. When a character investigates, read or paraphrase the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A cerulean dragon—no bigger than a husky—frantically flaps its wings as it barrels toward the walking castle. It nearly crashes and quickly tries to hide amid the structure's sculpted facade.
> 
> Pursing the dragon is a woman with wild gray hair streaked with crimson. She rides a flying, red broom and wears matching red goggles. An oversized birdcage dangles from her broom."
^17c

The dragon is Renesnuprah, now a [time dragon wyrmling](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/time-dragon-wyrmling-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") reduced to 10 hit points. The dragon quickly spots a character and begs to be hidden from the witch. If asked, the dragon refers to herself as Reenee.

The witch is Trikante, a neutral evil [archmage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) on a [broom of flying](Mechanics/items/broom-of-flying.md). Her mirrored goggles prevent others from seeing her eyes. She demands the characters give back her property. If asked, she shares the following details:

- She is Trikante, one of the greatest magical researchers the planes have ever known.  
- She's conducting magical experiments that are surely beyond the characters' understanding.  
- She purchased a time dragon for good money in the gate-town of "Ribcage". The time dragon escaped, and she wants it back.  

Reenee doesn't elaborate, but the wyrmling knows Trikante has dire plans for her.

If the characters don't stop Trikante, the mage easily recaptures Reenee and departs. If the characters intervene, she laughs but entertains trade offers. If the characters offer Trikante anything, she removes her goggles to get a better look. The character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score notices her eyes are silver pools. Trikante will accept any magic item of legendary rarity in trade, such as a [talisman of the sphere](Mechanics/items/talisman-of-the-sphere.md). If she's given such an item, she leaves Reenee alone and departs.

If the characters attack Trikante, she is a formidable foe. She fights until she's allowed to reclaim the wyrmling or she's reduced to 50 or fewer hit points, at which point she flees on her broom.

#### Wyrm Reception

If Trikante is dealt with, Reenee thanks the characters and says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> After taking a moment to catch her breath, the wyrmling lets out a long sigh. "Woo wee! First it was kidnappers, then nasty merchants in Ribcage, then that witch. I thought I was a goner! Thanks bunches for helping me out. I'm Renee!" The dragon pauses and looks around uncertainly. "You wouldn't know where home is, would ya?"
^17e

Reenee was kidnapped and wants to get home, but she can't tell the characters more. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check knows that time dragons dwell in the "Mausoleum of Chronepsis"—lair of a god-like dragon with unique insights into draconic fate. Characters can also learn this by spending an hour researching in the walking castle's library. If the characters share this information with Reenee, she asks them to take her to the mausoleum when they can. She doesn't rush the characters, so include the wyrmling in the adventure for as long as the characters like.

#### The Mausoleum

This event occurs when the characters near the Mausoleum of Chronepsis while the time dragon Reenee is with them. As soon as the mausoleum is within sight, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> From an expanse of ruins and dragon bones rises a great fortress. On its towering facade, brilliant light beams from an opening shaped like an hourglass. High above wheel the silhouettes of soaring dragons.
^180

As soon as the mausoleum is in sight, Reenee asks the characters to stop the walking castle. She knows the dragons are territorial, and she doesn't want to provoke them by bringing the castle closer. If the characters treated Reenee well, she thanks each character personally and gifts the group one of her scales. She then flaps off.

#### Scales of Time

If Reenee leaves the characters one of her scales, as the characters are departing the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As the walking castle strides away from the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, a shadow passes overhead. A massive shape settles atop a nearby ruin. It's a gigantic, ancient-looking time dragon with huge, branching horns that pulse with opalescent energy. A voice like a whisper reaches you: "Call, and I'll be there."
> 
> With that, a portal of swirling colors opens around mighty dragon. The great wyrm fades into it, then the portal vanishes.
^182

The dragon is Renesnuprah as an [ancient time dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/ancient-time-dragon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). She departs before the characters can act. The scale Reenee left begins to glow as it transforms into the following charm (a type of supernatural gift detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

- [Time of the Dragon](Mechanics/rewards/time-of-the-dragon-tofw.md)  

### Semuanya's Bog

In this encounter, a group of lizardfolk petitioners invite the characters to join them in visiting the realm of the lizardfolk deity Semuanya. Use this encounter wherever and whenever you please, particularly to lighten the mood after exploring a somber gate-town like Curst or Rigus.

The encounter starts when the characters hear a group of jovial cheers outside the walking castle. Read or paraphrase the following text when a character investigates:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A group of a dozen lizardfolk cheer as one among them strains, then hefts a barrel-sized boulder over her head. She holds it for a moment, then lets it drop to the ground amid even more cheers.
^185

A character who understands Draconic can hear the lizardfolk shouting support and cheering the lifter's "new personal best." The focus of the lizardfolk soon shifts to either the walking castle or any visible character. They energetically wave and ask the characters to stop for a minute.

#### Lizardfolk Competitors

The twelve [lizardfolk](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) are friendly Celestial "petitioners" (detailed in "Morte's Planar Parade"). They are led by the largest of their number: the colorfully frilled Sesspech. She introduces herself and eagerly shares the following information:

- She and her companions have just completed a jog around the Outlands and are on their way back to the realm of their god, Semuanya.  
- Semuanya is a deity of survival, athleticism, and physical prowess widely revered by lizardfolk.  
- The lizardfolk are tired from their years-long jog and would appreciate a lift to "Semuanya's Bog".  
- The lizardfolk can't offer much, but they're certain their fellows in Semuanya's realm will welcome and reward the characters.  

If the characters refuse, the lizardfolk understand and take it as a sign from their deity to push themselves toward greater gains. If the characters agree, the lizardfolk are appreciative. They board the walking castle and take to sunning themselves and doing light stretches on the terrace. The lizardfolk are polite passengers, full of encouragement, lifestyle advice, and enthusiasm for varied athletic pursuits.

> [!quote] A quote from Visshear Sher, crocodile toss champion and devotee of Semuanya  
> 
> "What's my secret? Well, I died, but then I started working out and seeing serious gains!"

#### Reaching Semuanya's Bog

The lizardfolk can travel with the characters for as long as you like. When the group finally reaches Semuanya's Bog, read the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The domain of the deity Semuanya is a pleasant-smelling swamp full of bright flowers and colorful bugs. Through trees draped in vibrant moss come the cheers of lizardfolk engaged in competition.
^188

Sesspech thanks the characters for bringing her group home and invites them to relax in Semuanya's Bog. If the characters decline, she thanks them again, and she and her companions depart. If you so choose, the lizardfolk might appear later when the characters need aid.

If the characters enter Semuanya's Bog with Sesspech, they're welcomed as guests. They can rest here for as long as they want, and followers of Semuanya can cast [cure wounds](Mechanics/spells/cure-wounds.md), [greater restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md), or [reincarnate](Mechanics/spells/reincarnate.md) if the characters ask.

If the characters ask to meet Semuanya, a lizardfolk tells them that the deity comes and goes unpredictably, but that Semuanya often appears to those who accomplish some great physical feat.

![Athletic petitioners train...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/042-02-014.petitioners.webp#center "Athletic petitioners train and compete in the swampy realm of the lizardfolk deity, Semuanya")

#### Contests in Semuanya's Bog

Life is good but not easy in "Semuanya's Bog". The spirits of lizardfolk champions engage in endless competition here. If the characters wish to join them, they're welcomed. Run any of the competitions from the Semuanya's Bog Contests table as detailed in the "Contests" section of chapter 9.

#### Meeting Semuanya

If the characters win three or more competitions, a manifestation of the god Semuanya appears. This manifestation of Semuanya is a muscular, 8-foot-tall lizardfolk. They have no game statistics and vanish if attacked.

Semuanya is bombastic. They think they're amazing and that everyone in their realm is also amazing—this includes the characters. Semuanya compliments the characters on their victories and rewards them with a trophy made of eternally blooming flowers and a small green dragon skull. The trophy functions as an [alchemy jug](Mechanics/items/alchemy-jug.md), but in addition to the liquids it can normally produce, it can create up to half a gallon of effervescent spring water. However, it can't produce beer, mayonnaise, or wine.

If the characters question Semuanya, the lizardfolk deity claims to know nothing of any disruptions in the Outlands or conflicts beyond the recent competitions in their bog. Soon after, Semuanya grows bored and departs to judge some fantastic competition elsewhere on the planes.

## Chapter 13–Secrets of the Spire

Once the characters restore the Mosaic Mimir's missing data, the magic device relates the information from "The Last Great Modron March" section in chapter 4. From this, the characters learn that the missing modron, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), likely followed the march's path to Dendradis, a rilmani community carved into the Spire. Upon traveling to Dendradis, the characters meet Ascetelis, a rilmani who offers to escort them into the Spire where the modron was last seen. Within the Spire, surrounded by mysteries of the multiverse, the characters finally catch up to [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)—but they're not the first to do so.

### Dendradis

Beings of absolute neutrality, rilmani originate from the Outlands, and their few communities cling to the Spire. These crystalline cloisters rise in clusters of crooked towers or fill natural crevices.

Among the largest of these communities is Dendradis, a lattice of crystalline structures weaving between the walls of a mile-high fissure in the Spire. Home to hundreds of rilmani, the town is accessed by a single gate. Within, a maze of corridors and ramps connects scattered dormitories, communal work halls, and chambers where varied scrying methods are used to monitor the planes. Visitors aren't welcome inside without an escort.

#### Unwelcome to Dendradis

When the characters approach Dendradis, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead rises the Spire, the infinitely tall, tapered column at the heart of the Outlands. While its height is lost amid clouds and the boundaries of sight, its lower reaches spread in wild foothills.
> 
> As you approach the base of the Spire, a narrow seam in its stony slope comes into view. The fissure is filled with a lattice of rainbow-colored crystals. Tiny windows and distant figures reveal these crystals to be towers and bridges, interweaving across the fissure. The structures obscure a great shape within the cavity: a giant, fossilized, multilimbed body.
> 
> At the seam's base stands a glimmering, crooked tower with a prominent gate. Two gray figures with armored bodies and bladed limbs flank the gate.
^18e

Two [ferrumach rilmani](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/ferrumach-rilmani-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") guard the entrance to Dendradis. They're indifferent to the characters but refuse to let non-rilmani enter without a rilmani escort. They turn hostile should anyone try to infiltrate the town. The ferrumachs share the name of the town, but they know nothing of [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). The rilmani don't comment on the mysterious body their city is sealing back into the Spire. Feel free to develop or ignore this mystery as you please.

> [!quote] A quote from Sazraen Tildoma, Fraternity of Order scholar  
> 
> "Rilmani abet good, evil, law, and chaos to maintain their vision of equilibrium, no matter the cost. What does that mean? It means I'd rather deal with demons. At least with them I know what to expect!"

#### Ascetelis

Before the characters depart or the situation with the ferrumachs grows too tense, a third rilmani arrives from inside. Read or paraphrase the following text:

![Dendradis, a Rilmani Community in the Spire](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/043-02-015.dendradis.webp#center)

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A third rilmani strides from the gate. This figure is leaner than the others, with a copper cast to their skin. They're reading a scroll intently, but they look up as they draw near. This new rilmani halts and does a double-take, looking from you to the scroll and back again. The newcomer then approaches, holds up the parchment, and asks: "Excuse me. Is this you?"
^190

This is Ascetelis, a [cuprilach rilmani](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/cuprilach-rilmani-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). In her hand is a scroll bearing the name of each character along with a brief and unflattering but accurate description. The final line reads, "[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). Modron. Mismatched."

Ascetelis is friendly, and she comes across as easy to impress, with a welcoming, folksy charm. She quickly explains she was just coming to look for the characters. She asks if [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is with them and gives an "aw-shucks" snap of her fingers when it's clear the modron isn't.

If asked why she's looking for the characters, Ascetelis explains her superiors have deemed the modron [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) a threat to multiversal balance. She hopes to find the modron and return it to Dendradis so her leaders can determine what to do with it. She's also been given the characters' names, as the rilmani know the characters have been inquiring about the modron and might know its whereabouts.

If the characters share that they've heard [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is in the area, Ascetelis is clearly surprised, and she says the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I'll be! Well, they say good luck—like all things—happens in threes. Sounds like we've got another surprise in store!"
^191

Ascetelis then asks if the characters will join her in searching for [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). She doesn't know where to go next but offers to escort the characters into Dendradis so they can ask around and see if anyone has seen the modron.

#### Ascetelis's Goals

Ascetelis, like most cuprilachs, is a spy and assassin. She doesn't tell the characters about her role, that the scroll she's holding is a hit list, or that she's been ordered to slay [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) and the characters for being threats to multiversal balance. She legitimately doesn't know where [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is and wants to tag along with the characters until they find the modron. Then she plans to manufacture their collective doom.

Until then, Ascetelis is cheery and eager to help her new, temporary friends.

#### Tracking R04M

Hunting [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) might lead the characters into Dendradis or to explore the Spire on their own terms. Ascetelis either joins or follows the characters.

#### Rumors in Dendradis

With Ascetelis as an escort, the characters can enter Dendradis and ask residents what they know about [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md).

Inside, Dendradis is a labyrinth of beautiful crystals and base metals inhabited entirely by rilmani. So long as Ascetelis is with the characters, the local rilmani ignore them. Rilmani who find an unattended character rush to alert the authorities, who send four [ferrumach rilmani](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/ferrumach-rilmani-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") to evict the trespasser with as little violence as possible.

##### Questioning Rilmani

Ascetelis suggests the group find and question rilmani artisans called plumachs. These rilmani harvest crystals from the Spire and might have seen [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). It takes Ascetelis an hour to find a plumach willing to acknowledge the characters. There's a problem, though. Even among rilmani, plumachs are notorious for avoiding strangers and their troubles. A character can get a plumach to talk by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. A character gains advantage on this check if the plumach is offered 250 gp worth of a rare material useful for crafting or the characters promise that after this conversation, no one in the group will ever speak to the plumach again.

If a character gets a plumach to talk, the rilmani shares that a modron was seen in the caves within the Spire called the Desert of Rust. The plumach or Ascetelis can direct the characters there (see the following section).

If the group fails to get the plumach to speak with them, Ascetelis can find them another plumach willing to talk, but doing so takes `1d4` hours. Plumachs avoid conflict; they use the same stat block as [ferrumach rilmani](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/ferrumach-rilmani-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade").

#### Steps along the Spire

Characters who spend a day searching the region around Dendradis for signs of [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) can make a DC 20 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. If they succeed, they find the tracks of a lone monodrone leading into a narrow cave. The cave runs for nearly a mile, then opens into the Desert of Rust (see the following section). The characters can't be certain these are [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s tracks—particularly if they're not sure what type of modron [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is—but it's the best lead they find.

### Inside the Spire

As mysterious as the Spire is, even less is known about what lies inside it. Just as the Spire's exterior poses an endless, unclimbable ascent, its interior holds a labyrinth of infinite tunnels and vertical hollows. Unknown to most except the rilmani, the Spire holds more than just these natural caves. Its caverns are lined with eerie rock formations and the eroded ruins of inexplicable structures. The Spire is hostile to magic, and many creatures instinctively avoid its dark, stifling interior.

#### Spire Interior Features

The tunnels in the Spire have the following features:

- **Antimagic Pockets.** The Spire is protected by invisible, drifting pockets of antimagic. Anytime a creature casts a spell, there is a 10 percent chance it triggers an [antimagic field](Mechanics/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell, centered on the caster and lasting for 5 minutes.  
- **Darkness.** The interior of the Spire is dark. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Preternatural Silence.** The Spire's interior is still and silent. Sound travels half as far as it would under normal circumstances. Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing are made with disadvantage.  

#### Desert of Rust

This miles-wide cavern within the Spire is covered in flakes of rust and, in some rare cases, fragments of eroded blades. Every few moments, a harmless metal scrap falls from above and clinks against the cavern floor. The cavern has no ceiling—it rises endlessly into the infinite hollow of the Spire's interior.

Ascetelis can tell the characters that rilmani artisans occasionally scavenge useful materials from the cave, but most of the detritus from above is worthless.

Characters find evidence of [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s passage after searching for 5 hours or by searching for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. This path leads up an incline toward a series of tunnels.

### Climbing the Spire

[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s path climbs the Spire's interior. If the characters follow, they pass through gradually sloping tunnels that take hours or even days to traverse. Use any of the following encounters as the characters climb. When you're ready to conclude this section, run the "Scholar of Impossibilities" encounter.

#### Memory from Elsewhere

As the characters ascend the Spire, they witness mysterious sights. These scenes aren't dangerous, but you can elaborate on them as you please. Roll on or choose a result from the Sights within the Spire table to break up the characters' climb.

**Sights within the Spire**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^sights-within-the-spire)`

| dice: d4 | Sight |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A statue of a giant, three-eyed horse juts from a cavern wall. It's so heavily eroded, it looks melted. |
| 2 | As the party skirts a vertical hollow, a body falls past them. A character who manages to catch the body finds that it's an ages-old, rag-clad elf skeleton. |
| 3 | A misshapen arch is covered in drooping, metallic, blade-like decorations. The arch was once a portal to a matching gate elsewhere in the Spire, but the portal no longer functions. |
| 4 | A character finds a coin from a familiar world or nation, but its markings refer to a land or ruler no one has heard of. |
^sights-within-the-spire

#### The Whisker

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A long and narrow span of wiry metal forms a bridge across a hollow in the Spire. Other metallic protrusions jut from the vertical walls.
^19d

This 200-foot-long, 5-foot-wide bridge connects the characters' path with tunnels ahead. A character who inspects the metallic bridge sees it is covered in fine metal growths. Characters can tell that the bridge is natural, and although it can bear the characters' weight, it is fragile.

##### Damaging the Bridge

Each 5-foot segment of the bridge is a Large object with AC 15, 10 hit points, vulnerability to lightning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If any segment of the bridge is destroyed, the entire structure crumbles, causing creatures on it to fall. This part of the Spire has no ceiling or floor. Any creature that falls into the hollow plummets until rescued.

##### Piercer Demigod

This crossing is home to the demigod Kirgaz Vizt the Unerring Avalanche, one of the few deities of [ropers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/roper.md) and [piercers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/piercer.md). Kirgaz uses the [piercer](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/piercer.md) stat block, with the following adjustments:

- If slain, Kirgaz is restored to life somewhere in the Outlands 24 hours later.  
- Kirgaz can cast [teleport](Mechanics/spells/teleport.md) without spell components once per day. The demigod is considered very familiar with the area around its obsession (see below).  

Kirgaz hides amid stalactites 30 feet over the bridge and uses its Drop action on the last character to cross. If Kirgaz misses, its Drop action affects the bridge, potentially damaging or destroying it.

Legends of Kirgaz say the demigod has never missed a target. If Kirgaz uses its Drop action and misses its target, the demigod becomes obsessed with that creature. Employing its immortality and ability to teleport, Kirgaz haunts the target of its obsession, dropping from unlikely places day after day until it strikes the creature. After doing so, Kirgaz is satisfied and returns to the Spire.

#### Tomb of the Frog

On entering this area, the character with the highest passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score hears heavy breathing. Those who investigate see the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This broad cave is humid and covered in thick mold. At the center sprawls a greasy, gray, wart-covered giant. He stares hopelessly into the darkness above. Dozens of crudely carved, amphibian figurines surround the hulk, staring expectantly with bulbous eyes.
^1a1

This cavern is roughly circular and hundreds of feet across, and it has a 30-foot-high ceiling. A tunnel on the opposite wall exits the chamber and leads higher into the Spire.

The giant has features suggestive of a human mixed with a fantastically ugly toad. He uses the [fomorian](Mechanics/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md) stat block. The creature is in a deep despair and is indifferent to the characters. Creatures that don't disturb him can walk past him unimpeded.

If one or more characters make themselves known to the giant, he turns his head and addresses them:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Are you here to worship me?"
^1a2

If one or more characters say yes, the giant invites them to sit with him. If no characters say yes, he goes back to staring.

Characters who speak with the giant get lethargic responses but can eventually learn that he believes he's a god whose followers forgot him, and now even he has forgotten who he is. The giant has no hope of regaining his memory or powers—if he ever had any.

##### Followers of the Frog

The giant urges characters who speak with him to become the first of his new followers. He ignores characters who refuse, but he's pleased if any characters agree and bids them to spread word of his perfection. Characters who agree to follow the giant—even if they're insincere—hear faint croaking (that only they can hear) whenever they rest or cast a spell within the next 7 days. The croaking vanishes after this time, the giant having forgotten the characters.

##### Slaying the Giant

The giant defends himself if attacked, and turns hostile if the characters antagonize him. During battle, any creature affected by the giant's Curse of the Evil Eye action gains amphibian-like features. If the giant is slain, his body rapidly decays into a heap of mold. From the remains grow `2d4` magical, neon-green toadstools. A creature that consumes one of these 3-inch toadstools is affected as if by a [potion of water breathing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-water-breathing.md).

##### Frog Figures

All one hundred and eighteen of these misshapen amphibian figurines are worthless, but each looks uniquely shocked.

### Scholar of Impossibilities

Run this encounter when you're ready to bring the hunt for [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) to an end.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The tunnel ends in a ledge overlooking a vast, empty crevasse. No path clearly proceeds above or below.
> 
> "Looking for friends, hmm?" comes a cloyingly shrill voice. The words emanate from a crack in the cavern wall fifteen feet above the ledge. A rotten stench emanates from within.
^1a7

It's easy to climb the stone wall to the 10-foot-wide, 25-foot-deep crag above. The space within is cramped, with a 6-foot-high ceiling. This forces the [baernaloth](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/baernaloth-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") inside to contort its gangly form in a painful-looking crouch. Around the baernaloth, the walls are smeared with blasphemous symbols, and foul icons dangle from twine made from hair.

#### The Scholar

This baernaloth is an evil being that calls itself the Scholar. It is curious about the characters and seeks to expose them to its corruptive ideas. Should a character converse with it, the Scholar speaks cryptically while sharing the following information:

- It saw a modron climb past its crag recently. It wouldn't suggest following it, though—the darkness above is hungry.  
- The Scholar seeks truths of the multiverse, both this one and those that came before.  
- It believes that when the time comes, it will be able to change the multiverse to suit its vision of profane perfection.  
- The Scholar will share a secret no mortal was meant to know with one interested character (see the "Secrets of Eternity" section below).  

If the characters ignore the baernaloth, leave its cave, or refuse its offers, it lets them go.

If the Scholar is attacked, it fights to defend itself. The cave isn't considered the baernaloth's lair, so it can't take lair actions here. If the Scholar is defeated, characters who search the cavern find a cleft surrounded by foul, bleeding runes. Inside is the [Book of Vile Darkness](Mechanics/items/book-of-vile-darkness.md).

#### Secrets of Eternity

If a character agrees to let the Scholar share a forbidden secret, the baernaloth requests that the character come close and let it whisper in their ear. The baernaloth then speaks in a language the character doesn't know but somehow understands. If the character lets the Scholar speak for a full minute, the character's mind is flooded with terrible knowledge. The character can't process the entirety of that knowledge, but what they can articulate is summarized by a secret from the Impossible Knowledge table or another mystery of your creation. The veracity and implications of these secrets are up to you.

**Impossible Knowledge**

`dice: [](3-part-2-the-mosaic-mimir.md#^impossible-knowledge)`

| dice: d4 | Secret |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The Spire is made of countless stacked versions of Sigil from past incarnations of the multiverse. |
| 2 | Portals are alive. They're all part of the god Aoskar, whose body forms the foundation for Dendradis, and who is thought to be dead but is far from it. |
| 3 | The Whispered One is coming, but there's still time to prevent him from claiming power over the spokes of the Great Wheel. |
| 4 | The entire multiverse is inside an impossibly vast [bag of holding](Mechanics/items/bag-of-holding.md). |
^impossible-knowledge

The Scholar shares its secret with only one character. That character gains the following charm (a type of supernatural gift detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

- [Eyes of the Impossible](Mechanics/rewards/eyes-of-the-impossible-tofw.md)  

### Ravenous Darkness

After a 100-foot climb past the Scholar's lair, the chasm opens onto a 30-foot-wide, 100-foot-long ledge. When the party approaches, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Nearly invisible strands of black webbing fill the hollow space above a broad ledge in the chasm wall. At the heart of the web hangs an indistinct form of greasy shadows and spidery limbs. Its unsettling, long limbs reach toward a number of bulbous cocoons in the web, at least one of which is still twitching.
^1ac

The creature here is a [darkweaver](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/darkweaver-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). As soon as it spots other creatures, it attacks and fights to the death—all the while narrating the ways it plans to prepare and consume its prey. If Ascetelis is with the party, she doesn't aid the characters in fighting the darkweaver.

The wriggling cocoon is a Medium object with AC 11, 8 hit points, vulnerability to radiant damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Inside is the errant modron, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) (see the following section).

The web holds four other cocoons. Each contains the bones of a long-dead Humanoid. The last cocoon opened also contains a conical hat covered in stars and a [wand of wonder](Mechanics/items/wand-of-wonder.md).

#### R04M, Sigil's Most Wanted

[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is a neutral good [monodrone](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/monodrone.md) with an Intelligence of 8. He speaks Common and Modron. [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is earnest, naive, and desperate to leave the Spire. He shares the following details once out of peril:

- His name is [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md).  
- He says he fled Sigil because "a fancy fox fiend was trying to disassemble him."  
- This fox fiend is holding modrons hostage in a secret prison. The modrons are doing things that are bad for the planes (he can't expound—it's just bad).  
- He escaped this secret prison but was captured and taken to a fancy place. He used a platinum casino chip he found and escaped through a portal behind a big wheel. He still has this chip.  
- [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) traveled through Sigil and the Outlands to hide but also to follow the path of the last Great Modron March, hoping to complete the march he started long ago and learn how the trapped modrons are disrupting the planes.  
- [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) can tell the characters are affected by the disruption the fox fiend's modrons are causing.  
- The modron doesn't know where to go, but he'd like to leave the Spire. He won't go to Sigil, where he's afraid the fox fiend will get him.  

[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s story contradicts what Shemeshka told the party, and he has never been her accountant. The easiest way to reconcile these discrepancies is to confront Shemeshka (see the following chapter). The modron gives the characters the platinum casino chip he used to escape Fortune's Wheel (see area F12 on map 3.1).

#### Escaping the Spire

Once they've conversed with [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), the characters can leave the Spire however they like. On their way out, Ascetelis attempts to ambush and kill the characters and then [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md). She attacks whenever is most opportune, perhaps when the group again crosses the Whisker (detailed in this chapter).

While attacking the characters, Ascetelis makes it clear that this is just a job and that her betrayal is nothing personal. The glitches affecting the characters make them threats to the planes, and the rilmani have decided the characters' deaths are the surest way to end their menace.

After contending with Ascetelis, the characters aren't readmitted to Dendradis. However, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) can show them a tunnel that connects the Desert of Rust with the exterior of the Spire. The characters can also find this tunnel after 1 hour of searching for an exit from the Desert of Rust. This chapter ends when the characters leave the Spire. Each character gains a level on escaping.
