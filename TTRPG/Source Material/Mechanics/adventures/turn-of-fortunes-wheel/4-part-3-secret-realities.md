## Chapter 14: Behind the Wheel

Having learned that Shemeshka might not be dealing with them honestly, the characters return to Sigil and Fortune's Wheel. There, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s platinum chip grants the characters access to the casino's hidden Platinum Rooms and Shemeshka's private sanctum.

![Shemeshka admires a captiv...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/045-03-001.splash.webp#center "Shemeshka admires a captive soul in her secret Abyssal realm, the House of Liars")

### Return to Sigil

How the characters return to Sigil from the Outlands is up to them. The portal they initially used to reach the Outlands remains open, but if the party wants to use a different portal, one can be found within a day's travel of any gate-town or near any other Outlands site. [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), the Castellan, or another NPC can provide this information.

If the characters haven't put together from [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s story that Shemeshka is up to no good, [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) or another ally can suggest the group should be wary on returning to Fortune's Wheel.

When they arrive in Sigil, the characters find it unchanged from when they departed. They can explore the city for as long as they please but should eventually return to Fortune's Wheel. Following [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s vague directions, they can find the portal behind the fortune's wheel game. A character who questions one of Shemeshka's employees at the casino and succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check can also learn there's a portal behind Fortune's Wheel, but most employees don't know how to open it.

### The Platinum Rooms

Hidden through Fortune's Wheel's high-roller rooms lies a demiplanar hub that links to the multiverse's highest-stakes games of chance. Here, powerful beings and entities forbidden from entering Sigil gather to place bets on events where lives and the fates of worlds hang in the balance. Amid this network of hidden games of chance, Shemeshka keeps her personal sanctum and the true riches of Fortune's Wheel: the arcanaloth's trove of secrets.

#### Staff and Visitors

The Platinum Rooms are staffed by approximately a dozen lawful evil tieflings who use the [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) stat block. They politely mingle amid the gambling areas, facilitating betting and fetching visitors refreshments. This staff is directed by Colcook, Shemeshka's personal aide, who oversees the Platinum Rooms from area P1. These staff carry no treasure, but they can pay out a character's winnings at booths similar to that in area P1.

The Platinum Rooms attract a diverse crowd of strange and powerful players. These beings are focused on their entertainment. They have no interest in the characters or the characters' plans, and they won't use violence unless attacked. Use the Platinum Rooms Visitors table to inspire who the characters might meet in the Platinum Rooms.

**Platinum Rooms Visitors**

`dice: [](4-part-3-secret-realities.md#^platinum-rooms-visitors)`

| dice: d6 | Visitor |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | An awakened animal or animate object on a winning streak |
| 2 | A famous mage, such as Bigby, Evard, or Tasha |
| 3 | A noble from a planar empire, such as a githyanki warlord or a genie noble |
| 4 | A down-on-their-luck adult dragon of any type |
| 5 | An inscrutable being that loves gambling and manifests as a column of light, eyes, or lost socks |
| 6 | A god randomly chosen from a "deity list" in the "Player's Handbook" |
^platinum-rooms-visitors

#### Guards

Two [warden archons](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/warden-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") monitor the Platinum Rooms from area P5. Shemeshka won an eon of these archons' service in a deal with a Celestial lord, and the bearlike archons—one black-furred and the other white—obey her dutifully. The warden archons visit areas P1–P4 only if a disruption the tiefling staff can't handle occurs or if a patron is clearly cheating at the games. Any individual who wins at three or more of the games in the Platinum Rooms is considered a cheater. When the archons appear, they politely ask whoever's causing the disruption to come with them to area P6, where they lock away culprits. Characters can access area P5 only by having the warden archons open the portal from that area.

#### Interrogating the Staff

Shemeshka's staff are under orders to keep visitors happy and busy gambling while also listening for useful information. The staff have no interest in sharing information about themselves or Shemeshka. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ([Intimidation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, a character can convince Colcook or another staff member to share the following information:

- An unmarked portal in Fortune's End (see below) leads to Shemeshka's personal retreat, called the House of Liars. The unmarked portal is one-way and can be opened only from the opposite side.  
- Guards on the other side of the portal monitor the Platinum Rooms for problems and cheaters.  
- Any who win too many of the Platinum Rooms' games are considered cheaters. The guards open the portal to Fortune's End and take cheaters through it, where offenders are never seen again.  

#### Platinum Room Features

![Platinum Razorleaf Casino Chip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/046-03-002.razorleaf-casino-chip.webp#center)

The Platinum Rooms share the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Enclosed areas have 15-foot-high ceilings.  
- **Climate Control.** All the Platinum Rooms have breathable air, normal gravity, and a constant temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit.  
- **Light.** Sconces lit by [continual flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells or sourceless overhead illumination fill each area with bright light.  
- **Realms Beyond.** Each of the Platinum Rooms is on a different plane. The features here affect the areas on map 14.1 and 50 feet beyond that area. Beyond that, the plane functions as detailed in the "Dungeon Master's Guide".  

### Platinum Room Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 14.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 14.1: Platinum Rooms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/047-map-03.01-platinum-rooms.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/048-map-03.01-platinum-rooms-player.webp#gallery)

#### P1: Fortune's End

Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters first enter the area:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This roughly circular room is made of pitted bone. Along its perimeter stand several alcoves, four of which hold swirling portals. Two large hollows provide a view of vast, roiling nebulae beyond. At the room's center, a tiefling with barbs protruding from his scalp stands behind a desk of polished bone.
> 
> "Welcome to the Platinum Rooms, illustrious guests," the tiefling says. "I'm Colcook, your concierge. If there's anything I can do to make your stay more comfortable, please let me know."
^1b9

The portal from Fortune's Wheel connects to the hollow skull of a dead god of misfortune floating at a far-flung edge of the Astral Plane. From here, portals connect to locations across the multiverse.

##### Colcook

Colcook (lawful evil, tiefling [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) is friendly and eager to serve. If the characters run out of platinum chips, he offers them one in exchange for a valuable secret, such as details about the attacks on Rigus from chapter 10 or anything the Scholar in chapter 13 told the characters. Colcook determines what counts as a valuable secret.

If coerced, he behaves as detailed in the "Interrogating the Staff" section. If compelled to aid the characters, Colcook encourages them to play and win at the Platinum Rooms' games to gain access to Shemeshka's chambers with minimum disruption.

##### Platinum Room Portals

Three portals here connect to the gaming events that currently occupy the Platinum Rooms. The portals are permanently open, but opaque energy prevents creatures from seeing or hearing what lies on the other side. Each of these portals has a placard overhead, naming the event beyond. These placards and their portals are as follows:

- **Dungeonland.** A swirling, misty portal leads to area P2.  
- **Supertemporal Arena.** A magenta portal leads to area P3a.  
- **Fiend's Ante.** A crackling crimson portal leads to area P4.  

##### Shemeshka's Portal

An unopened, golden portal stands in an empty alcove to the north. This portal leads to Shemeshka's refuge. This portal can't be opened from this room; only creatures in area P5 with the proper portal key can open it. Once opened, the portal remains open for 10 minutes.

#### P2: Dungeonland

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> An eclectic crowd of onlookers cheers as an image in a floating crystal depicts a knight being ravaged by a violet-striped saber-toothed tiger. Several similar drifting crystals display other armed individuals exploring ruins and engaging in death-defying feats. Beneath, on an island of bare stone floating amid a misty expanse, stands a plain archway and a circular desk attended by a well-dressed tiefling. Luminous symbols on a placard above the desk spell out "Bets," "Submissions," and "Enjoy Dungeonland!"
^1be

Dungeonland is a game that takes place on a rocky cluster drifting in the Ethereal Plane. Participants watch a group of adventurers navigate a deadly dungeon and place bets on whether the adventurers will survive or die. The characters can influence the game by submitting magic items, which appear in the dungeon for the game's adventurers to find.

##### Crystals

Four sizable, floating crystals drift about 8 feet off the ground. Each displays a scene from a lethally whimsical dungeon. The creatures depicted in the crystals are unaware they're being watched. Roll on the Dungeon Scenes table to determine what scene a crystal is depicting at any given time.

**Dungeon Scenes**

`dice: [](4-part-3-secret-realities.md#^dungeon-scenes)`

| dice: d4 | Scene |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | A beast with the body of a turtle and the head and appendages of a monstrous bovine breathes noxious gas at an adventurer. |
| 2 | An adventurer slowly reaches toward a lurid green sculpture of a yawning, fiendish face. |
| 3 | A bag-like monster that looks like an executioner's hood wraps around an adventurer's head. The adventurer struggles as they begin to suffocate. |
| 4 | An adventurer runs, holding an armful of jeweled sculptures that resemble various desserts. Behind them, a furious woman in crimson regalia screams, "Off with their heads!" |
^dungeon-scenes

##### Dungeonland Results

It takes an hour for a game of Dungeonland to play out, after which the adventurers exploring the dungeon either escape or meet terrible ends. Roll on the Dungeonland Results table to determine how the game concludes.

> [!quote] A quote from Aliss of Arabel, Dungeonland contestant  
> 
> "You ever get the feeling you're being watched? Not by, like, something sinister, but by throngs of drinky, otherworldly weirdos. No? Me either."

**Dungeonland Results**

`dice: [](4-part-3-secret-realities.md#^dungeonland-results)`

| dice: d10 | Conclusion |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Adventurers Lose. They're all slaughtered in one grisly encounter. |
| 2–3 | Adventurers Lose. They're picked off during events in the dungeon and by betrayal within the party. |
| 4–7 | Adventurers Lose. They're killed by traps and monsters. |
| 8–9 | Adventurers Win. Some adventurers escape the dungeon. |
| 10 | Adventurers Win. All the adventurers escape the dungeon. |
^dungeonland-results

The results of this roll can be influenced by submitting magic items at the betting booth.

![In Dungeonland, otherworld...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/049-03-003.dungeonland.webp#center "In Dungeonland, otherworldly gamblers bet on adventurers across the planes")

##### Betting Booth

Knol Knockturn (neutral, tiefling [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) runs the betting booth, a desk at the center of the island. Knol can explain the rules of Dungeonland and take any bets the characters place. The standard entry is 1 platinum chip with a bet on whether the adventurers will escape the dungeon. If a participant chooses correctly, they double their entry bet. If they bet wrong, they lose the chips they bet.

Knol places the chips bet in a plain-looking lockbox. Anything placed in box is teleported to Shemeshka's personal vault. He can also withdraw legitimately won winnings from the box.

##### Magic Item Submissions

Knol also accepts magic items to be added to the dungeon, which can influence the game's results. A bettor can send a magic item to the dungeon. The magic item must be in the bettor's possession and be of at least uncommon rarity. Knol takes the item, then has an attendant magically deliver it into the dungeon, where it falls into the adventurers' hands. Once a magic item is delivered to the dungeon, it can't be returned. After the magic item is submitted, roll twice next time you roll on the Dungeonland Results table and use the higher result.

##### Portal

This permanently open portal connects to area P1.

#### P3a: Supertemporal Arena Entrance

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sharp tiefling in a stylish gown stands behind a black podium in this stark, white room. On the wall behind her stands an archway filled with violet energy. A similar arch provides entry to this blank space.
^1c5

Amber Atwert (lawful evil, tiefling [assassin](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md)) welcomes anyone who enters the room to the Supertemporal Arena. She explains that through the portal behind her, two unfathomably ancient beings are about to conclude an eons-long struggle: Bowolg the Cosmic Rot and Volsheez the Ever-Empty.

Amber notes that a character can place a bet of 1 platinum chip on either of these primordials. If the chosen primordial wins, the character wins 2 chips. If they choose the wrong primordial, the character loses their chip. If a character places a bet, Amber accepts it and invites them to pass through the portal to area P3b.

She can also explain everything in the "Time in the Arena" section of area P3b, but she doesn't volunteer this unless asked.

##### Portals

The portal to the southwest leads to area P3b. The portal to the northeast connects to area P1.

#### P3b: Supertemporal Arena

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> All manner of strange immortals fill rows of seating inside a gigantic glass viewing sphere floating amid swirling energy. An unfathomable distance away, two incredible beings composed of stars and crackling magic are locked in the throes of a cosmos-shaking battle while the audience shouts and cheers. A single gate filled with violet light exits the orb.
^1c8

The Supertemporal Arena drifts at the edge of the Elemental Chaos in an infinity of dissipating energies.

##### Time in the Arena

The arena moves rapidly through time. Every minute in the arena equals 100 years in Sigil. Any mortal creature in the arena ages 10 years every 6 seconds (1 round). If a creature in the arena ages past its maximum age (as determined by you), it is reduced to dust. Unless noted otherwise, a character's life expectancy is around 100 years. If a character is killed in this way, the multiversal glitch causes them to reappear somewhere out of the other characters' sight, such as area P1.

##### Winning the Contest

There is a 50 percent chance for either Bowolg or Volsheez to win their ages-long battle, but which of these fantastically slow-moving entities will triumph won't be known for hundreds of years. In the sped-up time of the Supertemporal Arena, though, the battle plays out in `3d6` minutes. A creature needs to spend approximately 10 rounds (aging 100 years) to witness the end of the battle. On seeing the battle's end, a creature can use the gate to return to Fortune's Wheel and collect any winnings they've earned from Amber.

##### Losing the Contest

If a character bets on the loser, the character can't place another bet until 24 hours later, after Shemeshka's agents have found another improbable event to witness using temporal hyper speed, like the deaths of stars or which gate-town will be consumed by a plane next.

##### Portal

This passage travels through both space and time. Any creature that uses the portal returns to area P3a moments after they entered but aged by however long they spent in the arena.

#### P4: Fiend's Ante

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A lone archway stands atop a cliff overlooking the scorched cities and scourged terrain of a war-wracked world. Nearby, a ring of onlookers keeps a wary distance from a massive, scaled devil and a fiery demon playing a game of cards. Thousands of stars in the night sky bear red or green nimbuses.
^1ce

Tiefling attendants moving amid the crowd can explain that the gamblers here are Vixsheer the [pit fiend](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) and Bholmaz the [balor](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/balor.md), two generals of fiendish armies locked in the eternal Blood War. The Fiends are indifferent to the characters and the nearby audience. On the table is a deck of indestructible iron playing cards and several hundred similarly indestructible iron tokens. In the skies above are thousands of stars magically limned in fiery red or crackling green auras.

The Fiends are playing a variation on the game three-dragon ante. The stakes are Material Plane worlds—those of the nimbus-marked stars. Every token corresponds to one of the worlds, and the token's bearer has the right to lead legions in conquest of that world. The stars glowing with red flames have invasion rights claimed by the Nine Hells' armies, while the stars with crackling green auras are claimed by the Abyss's hordes.

The world beyond the game table is a lifeless planet. It was once lush and populated, but it has been globally ravaged by the Blood War.

##### Buying into the Game

A character can buy into the game with 1 platinum chip, which a tiefling attendant exchanges for several dozen iron tokens. Dozens of stars in the sky are then highlighted in a new color of the character's choice.

##### Playing the Game

After every 10 minutes of playing, a character can make a DC 18 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) or Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If they succeed, they double their number of tokens. If they fail, they lose half their tokens. If they fail twice, they lose all their tokens and are out of the game. While the table is large enough to keep a character playing the game away from Bholmaz's Fire Aura, Vixsheer's Fear Aura might affect them.

##### Goading the Fiends

Any character can goad the Fiends into attacking each other by succeeding on three DC 16 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks. These checks can be made once every 10 minutes during the game. A character doesn't need to be playing the game to goad the Fiends.

##### Winning the Game

A character wins the game if they succeed on three checks to play the game. The Fiends might attack the character if the character has been rude or is obviously cheating. A character is also deemed the winner if the Fiends slay each other, or if the character is otherwise the only one remaining at the table. A character who wins the game can collect 3 platinum chips from a tiefling attendant—even if one of character's incarnations was slain by the Fiends—along with an infernal document noting their right to invade the worlds they won as part of the game.

##### Portal

A permanent portal connects to area P1.

![Shemeshka's uniformed body...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/050-03-004.bodyguards.webp#center "Shemeshka's uniformed bodyguards, a maelephant and an eater of knowledge, defend the House of Liars")

#### P5: Shemeshka's Guard

Characters can only access this area if the portal here is activated, creating a connection with area P1 (see the "Guards" section earlier in this chapter). On entering this area, read the following description:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Colorful silks and mosaic patterns cover the walls of this airy entry chamber. Several shallow alcoves line the room's perimeter, and to the north stands a platinum double door. At the center of the room, a crystal sphere hovers over an ornate, burbling fountain.
^1d5

This area serves as a guard post for Shemeshka's inner sanctum. If they haven't been dealt with already, two [warden archons](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/warden-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") stand watch here and review scenes from elsewhere in the Platinum Rooms that flicker on the crystal sphere. The archons order anyone who clearly isn't in Shemeshka's employ to leave. They attack 1 round later, fighting to the death.

##### Crystal Sphere

The crystal sphere shows scenes of areas P1–P4, scrying on them as if it were a [crystal ball of true seeing](Mechanics/items/crystal-ball-of-true-seeing.md). The scene in the sphere changes to a different scene every 10 seconds. If removed from where it hovers, the sphere functions as a normal [crystal ball](Mechanics/items/crystal-ball.md).

##### Portal

A one-way portal here connects with area P1. It requires a powdered fox tooth to open—both archons here carry a vial of such powder. Once opened, the portal remains open for 10 minutes. See the "Guards" section earlier in this chapter for details on how to open this portal from area P1.

#### P6a: House of Liars

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Faint music and sharp perfume drift on the breeze blowing amid the columns and alcoves of this lavish chamber. Gemstone mosaics and platinum gilding glimmer amid hanging silks and furnishings heaped with cushions. The eyes of dozens of vulpine visages, sculpted on columns and decorative statues, stare in your direction.
> 
> Behind a narrow standing desk, a familiar, red-furred figure sighs and looks up from her work. "I've been expecting you," Shemeshka says, "but not quite so... still alive. I've never had gofers who've needed such convincing to just stay dead."
^1d9

[Shemeshka](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/shemeshka-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") wants the characters dead and gone. She calls on her two [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) bodyguards lurking in alcoves near the door: an [eater of knowledge](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/eater-of-knowledge-mpp.md) (that has consumed 5 brains) and a [maelephant](Mechanics/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade" for both stat blocks). Shemeshka has dressed them in Fortune's Wheel uniforms and doused them in perfume. The bodyguards attack when called.

Shemeshka avoids battle, as she considers it beneath her. However, she won't retreat and uses defensive spells, her Teleport bonus action, and her Fell Counterspell reaction while she mocks intruders and uses her domain to act against foes (see below). Once her bodyguards are dispatched, Shemeshka calls for a truce (see "What Shemeshka Really Knows").

##### Shemeshka's Domain

The House of Liars is among Shemeshka's favorite safe houses, a layer of the Abyss she conned away from its previous owner, the demon Alrunes. Shemeshka can will the semiliving domain to defend her. During any battle that takes place in area P6 while Shemeshka is present, roll on the House of Liars Defenses table each round at initiative count 0.

**House of Liars Defenses**

`dice: [](4-part-3-secret-realities.md#^house-of-liars-defenses)`

| dice: d4 | Event |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Mocking Winds. A blast of powerful wind that sounds like Shemeshka's laughter fills the area for 1 round. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). |
| 2 | Razorvine Bloom. Razorvines burst from the floor. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in contact with the floor must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (`4d10`) slashing damage and has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until the end of the next round. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. |
| 3 | Splendor. The area shimmers, and Shemeshka's visage appears in countless reflective surfaces. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by a [confusion](Mechanics/spells/confusion.md) spell. |
| 4 | Crushing Will. Amid the sound of vulpine yips and growls, Shemeshka's will overwhelms the minds of intruders. Creatures of Shemeshka's choice in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (`5d10`) psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack roll or saving throw before initiative count 0 on the next round. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. |
^house-of-liars-defenses

##### Mosaics

The walls are covered in geometric patterns formed by gemstones. Each of the thousands of gems holds a tiny figure. These individuals are spies, scholars, and foes of Shemeshka whom the arcanaloth keeps bound using the Resplendent Cage (see area P6b).

##### Treasure

A character who searches the room finds curios worth 15,000 gp, a [dagger of venom](Mechanics/items/dagger-of-venom.md), a suit of [demon armor](Mechanics/items/demon-armor.md), and an [instrument of the bards (Anstruth harp)](Mechanics/items/instrument-of-the-bards-anstruth-harp.md), all designed with vulpine shapes.

> [!quote] A quote from Precepts of the demon lord Alrunes, former ruler of the House of Liars  
> 
> "As followers of the Soothing Spirit, never speak above a whisper, never wear orange, and never, ever mention the House of Liars."

#### P6b: Resplendent Cage

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A circular mosaic of tiles on this alcove's floor depicts tormented faces caged beneath a lattice of razorvines.
^1de

Shemeshka uses this magical mosaic to lock away her foes and ensure certain secrets stay secret. Any creature with the [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition that spends 1 minute within the mosaic's circle is affected by the minimus containment effect of the [imprisonment](Mechanics/spells/imprisonment.md) spell and is trapped within a randomly colored gemstone that appears on the floor of this area. Any gemstone created by the mosaic that is returned to this area for 1 minute shatters, ending the spell and releasing the creature imprisoned within. This would affect each of the gems in the mosaics in area P6a. The alcove can be used to imprison or free a creature 10 times every 24 hours.

The [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the mosaic sheds an aura of abjuration magic.

##### Prisoners

Shemeshka tries to dissuade the characters from freeing random imprisoned creatures, many of which are evil or dangerous.

#### What Shemeshka Really Knows

Once Shemeshka's bodyguards are dispatched, she exasperatedly offers to tell the characters everything they want to know if they swear to leave and never bother her again. If they agree, she shares the following details:

- Each character independently ran afoul of Shemeshka some time ago. She was responsible for their deaths but, to her surprise, they returned.  
- She has killed each character dozens of times, only to have them reappear. She finally trapped each using the Resplendent Cage (area P6b).  
- The characters still returned, but they were diminished and had their memories fractured. She had her servants dump the characters at the Mortuary.  
- When the characters appeared again, she sent them to find [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) in the hope they'd never return.  
- Shemeshka still has imprisoned incarnations of the characters. She can retrieve them for the characters (a character who searches area P6a for 10 minutes also finds them).  
- She believes that the characters' unique situation is a result of a planar imbalance caused by a group of modrons lost in the Outlands. She hopes that by manipulating the data these modrons record, she can profitably influence the workings of their home plane, Mechanus.  
- Shemeshka corroborates everything [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) told the characters in chapter 13.  

As soon as she has shared this information, or if she is forced into battle after relating this information, Shemeshka uses an [amulet of the planes](Mechanics/items/amulet-of-the-planes.md) to escape. If she doesn't convey any of this information, the characters can learn it from meticulously kept documents stashed in Shemeshka's desk.

### Unity of Self

Each character has another incarnation of themself imprisoned in a gem amid the walls of Shemeshka's sanctuary. If these gems are found and placed in area P6b, the incarnations are freed, and the following things happen:

- **Lost and Found.** Each freed incarnation appears and then swiftly vanishes, dropping one or more magic items (see the "Heroic Equipment" section). The associated character receives a flood of sensations and their memories as this missing piece of themself returns. Among these are any other details about the character the player wants to be true—such as how the character ran afoul of Shemeshka (see the following section).  
- **Incarnations Reunited.** Every player whose character's incarnation is freed must choose one of their character's incarnations or a new one they create now. This is now their one and only character—who they truly are and have always been. The other incarnations aren't used again, and the details in the "Glitch Characters" section in the introduction no longer apply. Each character is now a regular character who lives and dies as normal.  
- **Level Jump.** The character gains multiple levels, advancing to 17th level and remembering their former, more powerful self.  

If a character doesn't release their lost incarnation, it might make the following chapter more challenging. Let each character decide what to do with their trapped incarnation. If they decide to release it later, they can do so by returning to the House of Liars or by magical means available in Sigil.

#### Returned Memories

When the characters' memories return, they're once again aware of the exploits of their 17th-level selves and how they ran afoul of Shemeshka's plots. Players can detail these memories however they please. They can fill in their characters' backgrounds all at once, or they can take time to process their characters' memories, recovering details a little at a time—potentially over multiple sessions.

Use the following questions to help players detail their characters' pasts:

- Did others consider you a hero or a villain?  
- For what accomplishment were you best known?  
- Did you know any of the other characters?  
- Did you have a home on the Material Plane, or did you travel many planes?  
- What catastrophe or betrayal led to your demise?  
- How do you know Shemeshka was involved in your downfall?  

The characters' pasts don't have any bearing on the rest of this adventure, but use these details to inspire where the campaign leads next.

#### Heroic Equipment

Trapped with each incarnation in the House of Liars are magic items each character possessed when they were at the height of their power. Now that the characters have regained that power, their lost magic items return. Each player should choose one of the following options, then select magic items of these rarities from the "Dungeon Master's Guide":

**Option A**: One magic item of legendary rarity

**Option B**: Two very rare magic items

**Option C**: Four magic items of rare or lesser rarity

As the DM, you must approve any magic items a player selects. Encourage any player who selects a [cubic gate](Mechanics/items/cubic-gate.md) to make another choice (as one appears in the next chapter). Feel free to also exclude unique magic items, like the sword [Blackrazor](Mechanics/items/blackrazor.md), or items you find disruptive, like the [deck of many things](Mechanics/items/deck-of-many-things.md) or a [ring of three wishes](Mechanics/items/ring-of-three-wishes.md).

### Fate of the Multiverse

With their memories restored, the characters are whole once more. However, they're now aware that they're not the only victims of Shemeshka's schemes. How they might put an end to this interplanar disruption is detailed in the following chapter.

End this chapter with each player deciding which of their character's incarnations is their true self, and advancing the characters to 17th level as described above.

## Chapter 15: Echoes of Delusion

With their memories and capabilities restored, the characters are prepared to face any threat in the multiverse. The modron [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) has their first challenge in mind, though: freeing its lost modron brethren and putting an end to the disruption in the Outlands that caused the characters to become unmoored from reality.

After the characters leave the Platinum Rooms, where they go next is up to them. Shemeshka will avoid them for the rest of the adventure. To continue with this chapter, the group should meet with [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), either by returning to the walking castle or by having the monodrone seek them out. There's no rush to move on with these events, though. Feel free to run other events inspired by "Sigil and the Outlands".

![Modrons marching endlessly...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/051-03-005.tyrants-spiral.webp#center "Modrons marching endlessly through Tyrant's Spiral pass the skull of the former archdevil Beherit... again")

### Missing Modrons

When the characters meet with [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) again, the monodrone assesses that they can now do what it couldn't: correct the multiversal disruption that affected the party and caused other glitches across the Outlands. [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) provides the following information:

- [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) was part of the last Great Modron March. The contingent he belonged to became lost in the Outlands.  
- [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) has deduced that the modrons are caught in the shifting realm of Gzemnid, a beholder god of deception, gases, and obscurement.  
- Shemeshka discovered the modrons in Tyrant's Spiral, an ever-shifting part of Gzemnid's Realm. There she exposed the modrons to fiendish influences, convincing them the Outlands are overrun by evil beings.  
- The modrons' belief is skewing the underpinnings of the Outlands and the planes beyond, creating multiversal anomalies.  
- Shemeshka planned to eventually release the modrons to Mechanus, where they would skew the workings of that plane. She would then take advantage of the chaos.  
- [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) wants the characters to go to Gzemnid's Realm; find the group's leader, the hexton modron called [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md); and help the modrons escape.  

[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) can also reiterate any details he provided in chapter 13. While the multiverse might contort to keep [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) alive, if the modron is dead, [Zaythir](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/zaythir-tofw.md) can provide this information as the result of her studies and investigations into Shemeshka's dealings.

[R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) notes that, as is customary in such dealings, he has compensation for the characters: a bag of gemstones the modron had stashed in the Outlands, valued at 15,013 gp. He will give the characters the bag if they help the modrons escape (see the "Unity of Rings" section later in this chapter for details). [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) can't haggle or offer any greater reward, but he can hypothesize on the dire ramifications of the modrons' long-term entrapment.

#### Back to the Outlands

Once the characters agree to aid [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md), they'll need to find a way to reach Gzemnid's Realm. [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) shares the location of the portal he originally used to escape into Sigil. This portal's location is up to you. Use this opportunity to return to a favorite site in the adventure or to help characters acclimate to their new powers. The [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md)'s Portal table suggests a few locations for the gate to Gzemnid's Realm.

#### Phenomenal Power

The characters have gained considerable power since their last adventure, and the challenges in the following section will test that power. Consider giving characters an opportunity to familiarize themselves with their new powers. Unused portions of this adventure, "Sigil and the Outlands", "Morte's Planar Parade", or even another anthology of D&D adventures can provide level-appropriate threats. When the characters are ready, proceed with the following section.

### Tyrant's Spiral

The realm of the beholder deity Gzemnid lies beneath the Outlands. Most entrances into these mysterious, gas-filled caverns are found near chaotically aligned gate-towns—like Bedlam, Sylvania, or Xaos—but Gzemnid's Realm is elusive, even by the mutable standards of the Outlands. The portion of the Great Modron March that [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) belonged to became lost in a magically shifting cave system known as Tyrant's Spiral. These gas-filled caverns change constantly, trapping the modrons in an ever-contorting circle that exposes them to the same grim visions over and over again.

#### Tyrant's Spiral Features

Tyrant's Spiral has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Unless noted otherwise, caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings.  
- **Gaseous Light.** Harmless, luminous gases shed dim light throughout the caverns. Strong winds, such as those created by the [gust of wind](Mechanics/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell, cause the gases to dissipate for 5 minutes before they refresh. During this time, a cavern is dark.  
- **Modron Tracks.** A rut of tracks marks the course of the lost, marching modrons. Any creature that enters this area on foot is affected as described in the "Marching Modrons" section.  
- **Tyrant Fungus.** Beholder-like fungi cover the cavern walls. See the "Fungal Observers" section for details.  
- **Planar Uncertainty.** Gzemnid veils his realm in uncertainty. Only portals and permanent teleportation circles allow reliable transportation into his realm.  

#### Fungal Observers

Gzemnid's Realm is covered with fungal growths bristling with eyestalks and harmless maws. The beholder deity Gzemnid sees through these fungi and threatens intruders by whispering through countless lichenous mouths. This effect can't be dispelled. Improvise how the arrogant god comments on the characters' situation. Gzemnid always refers to itself in the third person. Examples of the beholder god's commentary are provided here:

**When a character misses with an attack.** "How can you expect to hit anything with so few eyes?"

**When a character takes damage.** "Cast away your disgusting limbs! Embrace Gzemnid's globular perfection!"

**When a character kills a monster.** "Unworthy, but we accept your offering!"

**When a character calls on the power of a deity or patron to cast a spell.** "You beg for power from a weakling! Their pathetic magic is nothing in my realm!"

#### Marching Modrons

Thousands of modrons march through the caves, unaware that they're traveling in an endless loop. The modrons are indifferent to other creatures and ignore creatures they trample or creatures that try to communicate. If faced with barriers, the modrons create simple structures (like bridges or towers) by linking their bodies or dig around impediments. No matter how many modrons are destroyed, more take their place.

Any non-modron that enters the path of the marching modrons on foot is trampled. The creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 44 (`8d10`) bludgeoning damage and has the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition in the closest unoccupied space outside the modrons' path. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage but is otherwise affected the same.

Modrons are unaffected by the march and can move through it unimpeded.

#### Prepared for Power

Before running this part of the adventure, familiarize yourself with the characters' new class features. These powers should make the characters feel potent, but if you find the party overpowering encounters in this chapter, consider adding the following additional challenges after a round or two of combat:

- **Additional Foes.** If an encounter features several of the same creature, have one more of that creature or up to three [beholder zombies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/beholder-zombie.md) (mindless, chanting followers of Gzemnid) appear after 2 rounds.  
- **Gzemnid's Gaze.** One of Gzemnid's massive, aberrant eyes opens on the celling. It is a Huge object with AC 14, 60 hit points, and vulnerability to piercing damage. Every round at initiative count 0, the eye focuses on a different random character it can see. That character must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw, or the eye emits a ray that moves the character up to 30 feet in any direction—typically into pits, the path of the marching modrons, or other threats. The character has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until initiative count 0 of the next turn or until the eye is destroyed.  

#### Tyrant's Spiral Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 15.1. This map is divided into six smaller maps depicting sites along the modrons' endless march. The distance between areas varies from yards to miles. Feel free to add additional encounters between areas, to change their order, or to have the characters come across the same areas multiple times to reinforce the space's surreal nature.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 15.1: Tyrant's Spiral](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/052-map-03.02-tyrants-spiral.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/053-map-03.02-tyrants-spiral-player.webp#gallery)

#### T1: Lair of the Eye

Read or paraphrase the following text when the characters first enter the area:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You arrive on a ledge overlooking a massive cavern. Behind you is an archway of fungal stalks covered in eyes and chattering teeth. Eerie clouds of thin vapor drift through the space, emanating from narrow cracks in the floor and several giant holes in the ceiling. Through the space echoes the clangor of thousands of metallic feet. Countless modrons follow a deliberate route through the cave. Each of the geometrically shaped beings scans the strange terrain around them before vanishing into tunnels ahead.
^1f0

The characters arrive on a ledge overlooking the path taken by the modrons trapped in Tyrant's Spiral. The arch here is a duplicate of the portal the characters used to reach Tyrant's Spiral and connects to where they came from. A 50-foot, sheer cliff drops from the ledge to the cavern floor. The cracks in the floor and holes in the ceiling are winding and stretch endlessly through the depths.

- **Mummified Beholder.** Soon after the characters arrive, a withered [beholder](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) called Xabash floats into view and greets them. Xabash has an Intelligence of 6, is indifferent to the characters, and is highly forgetful. In a dreamy voice, Xabash asks if the characters are here to put an end to the bothersome noise (the marching modrons) or to ascend in Gzemnid's gaze. The beholder nods with a dull, fanatical gaze no matter how the characters respond. Xabash can provide general details from the "Tyrant's Spiral" section earlier in this chapter. Once the characters are done conversing with Xabash or if they attack it, the beholder drifts below one of the holes in the ceiling near the room's center (see the following section).  

##### Stalks of Gzemnid

Soon after the characters enter the area, an ancient beholder drifts under one of the holes in the room's ceiling, then rasps, "Great Gzemnid! See me clearly!" This might be Xabash or another beholder if Xabash was destroyed. A round later, the earth shakes, and a gigantic beholder eyestalk bursts from above. This [giant eyestalk](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/eyestalk-of-gzemnid-tofw.md) uses the [purple worm](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) stat block, but instead of Tail Stinger, it has the following action:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> **Eradication Gaze (Recharge 5–6).** The eyestalk creates an area of magical devastation in a 150-foot cone. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (`10d10`) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine violet dust.
^1f2

The eyestalks can bite with fang-like lashes and swallow creatures in its massive pupil.

The stalk devours the ancient beholder and then attacks the characters. If Gzemnid hasn't already spoken to the characters (see the "Fungal Observers" section), it does so now, decrying them as "more trespassers," "motes in Gzemnid's divine sight," and "vexingly asymmetrical!"

On the second round of combat, a second eyestalk emerges from the hole in the ceiling. Once reduced to 0 hit points, these eyestalks eject any swallowed creatures, retract into their holes, and don't appear again.

![Modrons trample the endles...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/ToFW/054-03-006.modrons.webp#center "Modrons trample the endlessly regenerating remains of the demon Arlgolcheir")

#### T2: Beherit's Head

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The modrons' path continues, leading past a many-horned skull impaled on a moldy stalagmite. Many of the clockwork beings flinch away from the sinister remains as they pass.
^1f5

The skull belongs to Beherit, a deposed archdevil who ruled the layer of Malbolge in the Nine Hells. It was placed here by Shemeshka's servants to influence the modrons. Although the archdevil is dead, a vestige of its evil remains in its 3-foot-diameter, horned skull. The skull has the following properties:

- Beherit's skull is sapient and lawful evil, having an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) within a range of 120 feet.  
- The skull can speak Common and Infernal, and it can communicate with any creature within 10 feet of itself telepathically. Its voice is a hissing whisper. It reveals that it can communicate only to a single creature at a time.  
- The skull can cast the [dominate monster](Mechanics/spells/dominate-monster.md) spell (save DC 20) three times per day. It orders [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creatures to free it, carry it to the Nine Hells, and slay any creature that impedes this. The modrons marching through the caverns are immune to the skull's domination.  
- The skull is impervious to damage.  

Beherit's skull can be removed from its stalagmite. The skull seeks to restore itself to life, which it believes it can do only in the Nine Hells. If the characters negotiate with the skull, it offers to aid their escape if they promise to return it to the Nine Hells. It knows that somewhere in Tyrant's Spiral is the maw of the beholder god Gzemnid, which has the power to create a portal out of the misty caverns.

#### T3: Ocular Space

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Billowing magenta fog swirls over the crumbling cavern floor. The modrons march up a narrow ramp, as the rest of the cave falls away into a bottomless pit. Giant rocks sculpted with massive, beholder-like faces float amid the gas, their surfaces bristling with attentive, fungal eye stalks.
^1f7

The rocks floating in this room are the petrified corpses of long-dead beholder demigods. Creatures can leap between two floating rocks by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A creature that succeeds on three of these checks can climb from the area's northern entrance to the eastern exit. A creature that fails one of these checks falls into the pit below (see the "Pit" section below).

A rock at the northeast edge of the area has a yawning mouth. This mouth holds a portal that opens near the gate-town of "Hopeless". To open, the portal requires a freshly cried tear—a fact characters might learn in area T4.

##### Beholders

Two [beholders](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) drift amid the floating rocks. They ignore the modrons but attack any other creature that moves amid the rocks. The beholders fight to the death while arguing between themselves whether to devour or to petrify the interlopers.

##### Pit

The pit is bottomless. Any creature that falls into it plummets for over 200 feet before landing on a ledge and taking 70 (`20d6`) bludgeoning damage.

##### Treasure

An [Ioun stone (mastery)](Mechanics/items/ioun-stone-mastery.md) is loosely embedded in the sculpted eye of one of the rocks floating over the pit. The first character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 18 or higher who comes within 5 feet of the rocks, or who checks the rocks with a [detect magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell, notices the gem.

#### T4: Arlgolcheir's Morass

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fetid stench accompanies the sound of the marching modrons trudging through sucking mud. Thick black sludge covers the floor of the cavern ahead.
^1fc

The ooze is all that remains of the semidead demon lord Arlgolcheir, a Fiend Shemeshka freed from an Abyssal prison and deposited here to terrorize the modrons. The muck has the following properties:

- The ooze is sentient and chaotic evil, having an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 22, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) within a range of 120 feet.  
- It can speak Common and Abyssal. Its voice is a halting rasp that chokes frequently.  
- When a creature enters the area covered in ooze for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 55 (`10d10`) acid damage and have the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. A [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Arlgolcheir can choose not to restrain a creature.  
- The ooze regenerates rapidly, making it effectively impervious to damage.  

Arlgolcheir seeks to reassume its demonic form and escape Gzemnid's Realm. It is being trampled by the modrons, which prevents it from restoring itself. The demon lord tries to convince the characters to halt the modrons trampling it. If the characters can stop or reroute the modrons for 3 rounds, Arlgolcheir changes into a version of its true form, that of a constantly rotting and re-forming corpse with shifting features (chaotic evil; use the [lich](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/lich.md) stat block). It revels in its freedom and shares anything it knows with those who free it, such as details of the portal in area T3 and how to activate it. After this, Arlgolcheir is quick to turn on the characters.

#### T5: Gzemnid's Maw

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Along the edge of a ravine, fungal clusters grow in ten-foot-tall stalks crowned by gigantic eyes. Below, rows of spear-length teeth bristle within the ravine, forming a gigantic, monstrous maw. Gases billow in and out of the crag in massive breaths.
> 
> The modrons continue their march over this impossible mouth, crossing it by creating a bridge made from interlocked, living modron bodies.
^1fe

The beholder god Gzemnid can see through this area's eyestalks and speak from the depths. Gzemnid encourages creatures to leap into its mouth or to destroy the modron bridge and send it toppling into its maw.

Any creature that falls into Gzemnid's maw plummets 200 feet before passing through a shimmering black veil, which obliterates the creature and leaves no remains.

##### Modron Bridge

Hundreds of modrons form the bridge that spans the ravine while other modrons cross along their backs. These modrons don't defend themselves, but three [nonaton modrons](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/nonaton-modron-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") emerge from the marching throng and engage any creature that attacks the bridge. These nonatons fight to the death. If the nonatons are defeated, three more nonatons arrive to defend the bridge after 1 minute.

##### Damaging the Bridge

Treat the modrons at the base of each side of the bridge as a Large object with AC 14 and 40 hit points. If destroyed, hundreds of modrons plummet into Gzemnid's maw, and the march halts for 5 minutes as more modrons pile atop one another to create a new bridge.

##### Outlands Portal

In addition to being a destructive rift, Gzemnid's maw is also a gigantic portal controlled by the beholder god itself. If Gzemnid can be convinced to open the portal and suppress the rift, the portal opens to a ravine near the gate-town of Xaos, and matter that passes through isn't destroyed. See "Escaping Tyrant's Spiral" later in this chapter for details on using this portal.

#### T6: X01's Throng

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Ahead marches a cluster of modrons. Among them, a quartet of powerful, gear-studded individuals hoist a unique-looking modron on their shoulders. This singular, elaborately constructed modron—a hulking creature with a single prominent eye—looks damaged. Nevertheless, flickering green light shines from its eye, scanning the foggy cavern around it.
^203

Four [septon modrons](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/septon-modron-mpp.md) carry their fallen leader, the [hexton modron](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/hexton-modron-mpp.md) [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade" for both stat blocks). Three septons attack any non-modron that comes within 10 feet of them and any creature that tries to interfere with [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md). The remaining septon continues to carry [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md), attacking only if [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) is stolen. The septons fight to the death.

Septons carrying [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) move with the other modrons at a rate of 20 feet per round. The septons drop their leader only if they have the [incapacitated](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition or take 30 or more damage from a single attack.

##### X01

The modrons' leader has full hit points and the [paralyzed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition. [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) can be interacted with only if it is separated from its septon bearers and moved away from the marching modrons. If the characters move [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) away and attempt to repair or otherwise interact with it, see the following section.

### Bad Data

The modron leader [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) isn't just damaged—its mind has been overwhelmed. This is a result of flawed orders [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) received when it left Mechanus during the last Great Modron March, but more so because the misinformation it gathered in Tyrant's Spiral has skewed its understanding of the Outlands. [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) and the modrons it leads now believe the Outlands are overrun with fiendish horrors and that the gears of Mechanus require major readjustments to restore balance to the planes.

#### Investigating X01

A character who spends 1 minute investigating [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) finds a panel on the modron's head leaking green vapor. If the panel is opened or [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) is deliberately damaged, read the following:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The modron jolts up and, with a voice like a klaxon, shouts, "Wrong! All wrong! Outlands: overrun! Great Wheel: at risk! Advisement: full planar realignment! Highest alert!" The modron continues issuing such dire reports. As it does, wisps of green vapor leak from its mouth, eyes, and seams. Gradually this vapor congeals into a nightmarish depiction of the Spire and the surrounding Outlands.
^207

The character with the highest Intelligence who witnesses this realizes the congealing vapor is [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s interpretation of the Outlands, one overrun with evil Fiends. This becomes clear a moment later when [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s shouting escalates. Proceed with the following section.

#### Corrupted Data

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The modron's shouting becomes a screech of panicked static, and the image of the Outlands shudders and roars. It undergoes a terrifying transformation, blooming into a multilimbed, mechanized terror with a single, baleful eye that turns in your direction.
^209

The modrons' belief that the Outlands have been corrupted are so strong that they've shaken the underpinnings of the plane. Now these mistaken beliefs manifest as a [planar incarnate](Mechanics/bestiary//planar-incarnate-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") of a plane that doesn't exist: a Fiend-overrun version of the Outlands (use the planar incarnate's Fiend form). The planar incarnate is hostile toward non-modrons. The round after appearing, it attacks the characters and fights until destroyed.

##### Replacement Data

As the planar incarnate is a manifestation of [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s beliefs, those beliefs can be undermined. A character can present to [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) evidence that the Outlands aren't overrun by Fiends, such as mementos they picked up in the gate-towns or recordings from the Mosaic Mimir. If a character uses an action to present such information and succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, the planar incarnate has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of the character's next turn.

#### Lost Data

Once the planar incarnate is destroyed, [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) collapses. A character with proficiency in Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Medicine](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Medicine)) can tell the following:

- [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) is alive, but its mind is vacant.  
- To reactivate, [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) would need to recover its knowledge about the planes.  

The Mosaic Mimir has the information [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) needs to reactivate. The characters might come to this conclusion on their own, or a character who investigates [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s body might realize that within the damaged panel is enough room for the [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md). If a character inserts the [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) into [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md), the hexton reactivates a moment later. This has multiple effects, which are summarized in the following sections.

### Reactivating X01

Should the characters reactivate [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) by embedding their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) in the modron leader, [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s perspective on the Outlands shifts. This view rapidly disseminates among the other modrons trapped in Tyrant's Spiral. What this perspective is depends on what information the characters recorded in their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) during part 2 and whether their reports on the Outlands were accurate, inconsistent, or skewed. Consult the Mimir Restoration Tracker from chapter 4, and choose which of the following sections best matches the information the character recorded in their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md). Each entry details the data's effects on [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s personality and has ramifications in the "Conclusion" section.

#### Accurate

If the characters' [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) largely details the Outlands in an unbiased way, [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) realizes reality is behaving within expected parameters. It reactivates as a calm, logical modron that is eager to lead its followers directly to Mechanus, where they can make an unremarkable report.

#### Inconsistent

If the characters provided inconsistent details about the Outlands—several accurate and several skewed—[X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) reactivates and exhibits dramatic mood swings. It seeks to lead the modrons to its home plane, but it is uncertain where that is.

#### Skewed

If the characters' reports on the Outlands reflect their bias for a particular philosophy or alignment, the modrons act in opposition. The Skewed Data Results table notes [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s personality after being influenced by data skewed along the lines of particular alignments. If the information characters provided to their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) strongly reflects the philosophies of a faction in Sigil, choose the result that best corresponds with that faction's agenda.

**Skewed Data Results**

| Data Skewed | X01's Personality |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Chaotic | Rigid, even for a modron, and insistent that the characters aid it in returning to Mechanus |
| Evil | Serene and overly concerned about the characters' safety |
| Good | Manipulative and eager to abandon the characters and the other modrons after it escapes |
| Lawful | Distractable and prone to recklessness |
^skewed-data-results

### Escaping Tyrant's Spiral

If [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) is reactivated, the modron wants to escape Tyrant's Spiral, but it doesn't know about the portals in the nearby areas. Characters might use the methods here to help the modrons escape.

#### Portal to Hopeless

The portal to "Hopeless" in area T3 is narrow and a challenge for the modrons to reach. It will take days for all the modrons to pass through, and likely many portal-key tears to keep the portal open. [Beholders](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) also frequent this area and try to pick off modrons as they escape.

#### Portal to Sigil

The portal in area T1, which the characters used to enter Tyrant's Spiral, still functions. However, like the portal to Hopeless, it is difficult to reach. Additionally, unleashing thousands of modrons on Sigil is dangerous. Should this happen, the Lady of Pain intervenes quickly and, through a [dabus](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/dabus-mpp.md), informs the characters they have 10 minutes to set things right. How the characters can reconcile this—and avoid the Mazes—is up to you.

#### Portal to Xaos

The portal in area T5 opens only when Gzemnid pleases. Characters can convince the beholder god to let the modrons pass, but Gzemnid demands to consume half the modrons first. A character can convince Gzemnid to eat only a quarter of the modrons by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, or they might bribe Gzemnid with the promise of bringing it a more tempting meal—for example, it has always wanted to eat a dragon or another god.

#### Remarkable Escape

It would take hundreds of castings of spells like [gate](Mechanics/spells/gate.md) or [teleportation circle](Mechanics/spells/teleportation-circle.md) to relocate all the modrons. You might allow the characters to develop outlandish schemes or entreat otherworldly beings to help the modrons escape. Debts and ramifications accrued here can provide springboards to future adventures.

#### Abandonment or Sacrifice

The characters can leave the modrons in Tyrant's Spiral, but eventually Shemeshka or another being will manipulate the modrons to their own ends. If the characters try to destroy the modrons en masse, [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) commands the modrons to defend themselves. Although annihilating the modrons would maintain the equilibrium of the planes, doing so might have ramifications on characters' alignments.

## Conclusion

If the characters release [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) and the modrons from Tyrant's Spiral, their work for [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) is complete, but the ramifications for the multiverse might be dire.

### Realigning the Multiverse

How the characters contend with the lost modrons has far-rippling effects on the multiverse. The data from the characters' [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) affects not just [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md)'s perspective but also those of thousands of modrons. If the modrons return home, this data influences the cosmic alignment of Mechanus. Countless modrons across the multiverse then seek to rebalance the planes in accordance with the new arrangement of the plane of absolute law.

Depending on how the characters' [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) affected the liberated modrons, the axiomatic beings affect the multiverse in one of the following ways. Choose whichever one corresponds with the result from the "Reactivating X01" section. This determines how the characters' actions and the released modrons affect the planes.

#### Accurate

On returning to their home plane, the modrons report their data, which results in incremental refinements to Mechanus's workings. No precipitable changes to the status quo of the multiverse occur. No other creatures suffer the multiversal glitch the characters experienced.

#### Inconsistent

Unless the characters intervene, it takes months for [X01](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/x01-tofw.md) and a much-diminished group of modrons to return to Mechanus. When they do, chaos ensues. Modrons behave strangely across the planes, and chaotic creatures like slaadi operate unopposed. Numerous creatures experience the multiversal glitch that affected the characters. Ultimately, the modron leader, Primus, initiates a new Great Modron March to correct the chaos sweeping the planes.

#### Skewed

On the modrons' return to Mechanus, the skewed data in the characters' [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) causes all modrons across the planes to react differently toward different philosophies or types of beings. The Multiversal Effects of Skewed Data table summarizes the new behavior of the vast majority of modrons.

**Multiversal Effects of Skewed Data**

| Data Skewed | Multiversal Effects |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Chaotic | Modrons more vigorously oppose chaotic beings; modrons become more hostile against chaotic beings and expressions of lawlessness. |
| Evil | Modrons oppose evil beings; Celestials ally with modrons to crusade against evil across the planes. |
| Good | Modrons oppose good beings; Fiends manipulate modrons to besiege bastions of good across the planes. |
| Lawful | Modrons withdraw to Mechanus; chaotic beings act unopposed across the planes. |

### Unity of Rings

Once the characters have dealt with the modrons and escaped Tyrant's Spiral, they're free to go where they please. If they find themselves in the Outlands and seek to return to Sigil, they can find a portal to the city near the closest gate-town. This portal opens within sight of the Mortuary.

Back in Sigil, the characters might seek out any of the following parties.

#### Farrow or Other Sigil Contacts

[Farrow](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/farrow-tofw.md) or another Sigil-based ally is glad to hear the characters resolved the strangeness plaguing them. The ally is well connected and know others who need accomplished adventurers. The ally also knows of useful portals, including those to Material Plane worlds the characters might hail from. Use this ally to lead the characters to future adventures.

#### R04M

Depending on how the characters resolved the situation in Tyrant's Spiral, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) might be pleased or horrified. Nevertheless, if the characters helped any of the modrons escape, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) rewards them with the promised gems. This includes gems worth 15,013 gp as well as an [elemental gem (emerald)](Mechanics/items/elemental-gem-emerald.md) and a resin-encrusted [ring of regeneration](Mechanics/items/ring-of-regeneration.md).

If the modron remains on good terms with the characters, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) might seek to join them and see more of the multiverse. Or, if the characters have skewed the planes in some way, [R04M](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/r04m-tofw.md) might seek to set things right, perhaps by pursuing multiversal secrets within the Spire.

#### Shemeshka

The arcanaloth is frustrated by the characters' interfering with her plot and avoids them for a time, but she isn't one to let annoyance get in the way of opportunity. Shemeshka might eventually contact the characters to involve them in future schemes.

Shemeshka might contact the characters sooner if the data in their [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) skewed toward evil, as it's possible the characters produced the results she was seeking. If they did, the arcanaloth enjoys increased business selling weapons to demons, devils, and modrons embroiled in the Blood War. Shemeshka sends the characters polite thank-you notes, each with a complimentary platinum casino chip and an invitation to visit Fortune's Wheel anytime.

#### Sigil Factions

A character who reports their exploits to a Sigil faction they're a member of gains the attention of their faction's leaders. If the characters' [mimir](Mechanics/items/mimir-sato.md) changed the multiverse in a way that their faction is in favor of or opposed to, a character's faction leader might have work for the party, either capitalizing on changes to reality or seeking to set things right.

### The Lady's Gift

After the characters have attended to any immediate business in Sigil, read or paraphrase the following text when next they're traveling together in the city:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> It's unclear when or how it happened, but the street around you is empty and still. Before you can ponder the cosmically infinitesimal chances of a Sigil street emptying, a somber, gray-skinned figure floats into your path. The dabus hovers silently as a string of illusory images fade in to view around it. Prominent among these symbols is the razored image of the Lady of Pain.
^221

The first character to succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check deciphers the dabus's message. It reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The Lady saw what you did. She has a message: stay out of trouble.
^222

Once the message is deciphered, the dabus points at the door of an empty building nearby and then floats away. If a character opens the door, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The rickety plank door opens easily, revealing a wall of crusty bricks and gnarled razorvine. Embedded at the wall's center is a perfectly square, metallic brick with a faintly glowing towerlike rune on its surface.
^223

The glowing brick is a [cubic gate](Mechanics/items/cubic-gate.md), which slips from the wall effortlessly. The magic item is keyed to this door in Sigil, a door in the characters' walking castle on the Outlands, a world on the Material Plane, and three other planes of your choice.

As the cube is removed, the brick wall transforms into the glowing arch of an active portal that leads anywhere you choose.

The adventure ends here, with the characters on the threshold of the multiverse—a place every bit as unpredictable and dangerous as it has always been.
