# Appendix A: Magic Items and Technology
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase* 

This appendix describes magic items and futuristic technology that appear in the adventures.

## Magic Items

The following magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

- [Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn](Mechanics/items/daouds-wondrous-lanthorn-qftis.md)  
- [Heretic](Mechanics/items/heretic-qftis.md)  
- [Staff of Ruling](Mechanics/items/staff-of-ruling-qftis.md)  

## Technology

This section presents technological devices and weapons that have special rules. The items are presented in alphabetical order. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information on "explosives and other futuristic weapons", such as [laser pistols](Mechanics/items/laser-pistol.md) and [antimatter rifles](Mechanics/items/antimatter-rifle.md).

On many D&D worlds, these devices are strange and unfamiliar anomalies, if they exist at all. If you're nervous about including such technology in your game, you can limit the number of [energy cells](Mechanics/items/energy-cell.md) the characters discover during their adventures. Most devices are useless without them.

Due to their rarity, these items are priceless.
