# Chapter 5: Pharaoh
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase* 

Few deserts are as harsh and inhospitable as the Desert of Desolation, where the sun, the wind, and the land itself seem to despise all living things. The ghost of a long-dead pharaoh, Amun Sa (AH-muhn sah), roams the sun-scorched dunes, appearing to those who trek across the sands. Condemned to wander the desert for eternity, Amun Sa pleads with adventurers to free his cursed soul and save this doomed land—but none have returned from his pyramid. Within the pharaoh's tomb lie deadly traps, sinister threats, and the secret to ending the ancient curse.

"Pharaoh" is designed for four to six 7th-level characters.

## Background

This section details the history of Amun Sa's curse and ways to involve the characters in the adventure.

### The Ruin of Bakar

![A Door to the Pharaoh's Pyramid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/074-05-002.pharaoh-door.webp#center)

Long ago, the kingdom of Bakar spanned what is now known as the Desert of Desolation. Though the land was already a desert, the mighty River Athis flowed through the region, making the land along its banks flourish. Animals, plants, and the citizens of Bakar prospered from its life-giving waters.

The pharaohs of Bakar believed that if their bodies were prepared with specific funerary rites and then entombed with their wealth, they could ascend to their chosen afterlife. Amun Sa, the last pharaoh of Bakar, took this tradition further than any of his predecessors. He was paranoid of grave robbers, believing that if his tomb were plundered, it would bar his passage to paradise. To safeguard his treasures, Amun Sa commissioned a theft-proof tomb, a solemn pyramid unlike anything the region had ever seen. To fund this elaborate and impenetrable fortress, he declared war on Bakar's neighboring lands and taxed his own people into destitution.

#### A Curse on the Land

Downtrodden and impoverished, the citizens of Bakar revolted against Amun Sa to take back their kingdom. During a riot at the capital, Amun Sa appeared before his people and cursed them, holding high his two royal implements—the [Staff of Ruling](Mechanics/items/staff-of-ruling-qftis.md) and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar (a [Gem of Seeing](Mechanics/items/gem-of-seeing.md)). He invoked the gods and decreed that if his people should ever kill him, the River Athis would cease its life-giving flow.

Suddenly, from the sea of upraised fists sped a single spear, piercing the pharaoh's heart; as Amun Sa died, so too did the river. The riverbed dried up within days, and without its waters, Bakar quickly collapsed. Over the years that followed, Bakar's cities were overtaken by the dunes, and its people fled to neighboring lands.

#### A Curse on the Pharaoh

After his death, Amun Sa's spirit began its journey to the afterlife, but he was stopped by a god of death. The disapproving god chastised the pharaoh's spirit:

"Your legacy was meant to be the benefit you brought to the people under your stewardship, not this stone edifice. As you looked only to your death in life, so shall you look only to your life in death.

"I am bound to fulfill your curse, for you have called it down with power in my name. But I also curse you, Amun Sa, that you shall not voyage into the beyond until some mortal soul does as you so feared, removing your staff and star-gem from your tomb. Only then will your spirit and the land be healed."

Centuries later, Amun Sa's spirit still roams the desert, cursed to wander the dunes until he finds mortals skilled enough to overcome the traps and perils in his tomb and put his soul to rest.

### Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using [Nafas](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md) as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Condemned for his actions in life, the ghost of a long-dead pharaoh wanders the desert, day and night. Eons of torturous solitude have shown him the error of his ways, and he asks for brave mortals to free his soul and end an ancient curse upon the land. Seek him out and heed his call."
^2e1

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door along the staircase that opens into a bleak desert. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

### Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in this adventure:

- **Exiled.** The characters committed a crime or earned the ire of a powerful figure and were exiled to the Desert of Desolation as punishment. They're left in the middle of the desert with no food or water.  
- **River Restoration.** The characters have heard tales of a magical river in this region whose waters foster bountiful crops and heal those who drink from it. Legends state a curse dried up that river eons ago. The characters have journeyed to the desert to find a way to end the curse and restore the river. They might have been hired by the Tears of Athis, a newly formed group of historians and priests dedicated to this goal.  

### Setting the Adventure

The Desert of Desolation is part of Raurin, a vast desert in southeastern Faerûn in the Forgotten Realms. When the River Athis dried up, it transformed the kingdom of Bakar from a thriving oasis into Raurin's driest region.

However, the Desert of Desolation could be any desert of your choice, or an inhospitable stretch in an otherwise lush region, due to Amun Sa's curse. Consider the following suggestions:

- **Dragonlance.** The adventure takes place in a small, cursed region within the Plains of Dust.  
- **Eberron.** The long-lost kingdom of Bakar occupied a portion of the Blade Desert that's now uninhabitable.  
- **Greyhawk.** The Desert of Desolation might be another name for the Bright Desert.  

## Adventure Summary

"Pharaoh" begins with the characters wandering the Desert of Desolation. After enduring the desert's terrible monsters and harsh conditions, they happen on the ghost of Amun Sa, who beseeches them to enter his pyramid and retrieve his royal staff and star-gem to end the curse that blights both the land and his soul.

Inside the pyramid, the characters meet the Tears of Athis, a group of historians and priests from the surrounding regions who hope to restore the flow of the holy River Athis. While exploring the pyramid, the characters must navigate a false tomb, a disorienting maze, and halls rife with Undead, then overcome a mummy lord who stands in their way.

Once the characters exit the pyramid with Amun Sa's implements, the pharaoh's soul is freed and the curse on the land is lifted, restoring the River Athis. The descendants of Bakar can then reclaim their lands from the desert and prosper once more.

### Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving the following milestones rather than defeating monsters:

- **Escape the Maze.** The characters gain 1 level when they escape the Maze of Mists and reach the third floor of the pyramid for the first time.  
- **Recover Amun Sa's Implements.** The characters gain 1 level when they recover both the [Staff of Ruling](Mechanics/items/staff-of-ruling-qftis.md) and the [star-gem of Mo-Pelar](Mechanics/items/gem-of-seeing.md).  

If you follow this method, the characters should reach 9th level by the adventure's conclusion.

> [!readaloud] About the Original
> 
> *Pharaoh* was originally published by Tracy and Laura Hickman's game company, DayStar West Media, in 1980. They later sold their adventures to TSR, which liked the adventures so much that it not only reprinted *Pharaoh* in 1982 but also hired Tracy Hickman. TSR later published two more adventures in the Desert of Desolation trilogy.
> 
> *Pharaoh* was praised for blending masterful dungeon design with a compelling narrative. A year later, the Hickmans built on those same strengths when they introduced the world to the vampire Strahd von Zarovich in *I6: Ravenloft*.
^about-the-original

## Desert of Desolation

A centuries-old curse has made the Desert of Desolation uninhabitable. Nothing grows in the desert, and no one has settled its once-green hills since the reign of Amun Sa. The sun scorches its grayish dunes with unnatural intensity, and the few clouds that cross its barren sky bring only choking dust.

The adventure begins with the characters trekking through the desert. Depending on what brings the characters there, they might be searching for answers within the region or trying desperately to escape it. At your discretion, each of the characters might begin this adventure with a [camel](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/camel.md) or a [draft horse](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/draft-horse.md) to ride.

### Desert Heat

For `1d6` hours of each day, the desert becomes unbearably hot, rising to temperatures well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The "extreme heat" has detrimental effects on creatures not acclimated to such environments (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

In addition to resting, the characters can remove any accumulated levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) by drinking the water of Athis, which still flows within Amun Sa's pyramid (detailed later in this adventure).

### Starting the Adventure

Read or paraphrase the following text to begin:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The gray mounds of the desert roll toward the horizon. Not one stone shows through the powdery sand, nor does a single insect scurry across its surface. All around you, the burning silence of the sea of sand is unnaturally oppressive and foreboding. Ash and dust billow around your feet and choke your parched throats. There are no landmarks in sight—except the sun, which seems to burn hotter than ever.
^2ea

The characters wander the desert for two days before encountering the ghost of Amun Sa. At your discretion, Amun Sa's ghost can take longer to appear, exposing the characters to more of the desert's threats, which are detailed in the "Desert Encounters" section below.

When you're ready to progress the story, proceed to the "Ghost of Amun Sa" section.

### Desert Encounters

For each day the characters spend in the desert, roll on the Desert of Desolation Encounters table to determine what the characters encounter, rerolling duplicates.

**Desert of Desolation Encounters**

`dice: [](06-chapter-5-pharaoh.md#^desert-of-desolation-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two [bulettes](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/bulette.md) with sandstone-textured carapaces burrow up from the dunes and attack. The bulettes focus on mounts and Small creatures in the party (if any), seeking to drag them beneath the sands. |
| 2 | The characters spot a lush oasis, but it's a mirage. A character who studies the oasis and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check recognizes the illusion for what it is. A creature that enters the oasis steps into a [quicksand pit](Mechanics/traps-hazards/quicksand.md) (see the [Dungeon Master's Guide](Mechanics/traps-hazards/quicksand.md)). |
| 3 | A dust storm rises on the wind. The storm lasts 1 hour, during which time the characters have disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. Shortly after the dust storm begins, an [air elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) and eight [dust mephits](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/dust-mephit.md) materialize from the sands and attack. |
| 4 | Four [gricks](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/grick.md) lie in ambush just beneath the sand. Adapted to the desert climate, the gricks have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to [hide](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Hide) in desert terrain. |
| 5 | A snobbish [efreeti](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) royal saunters across the desert. He demands each character pledge a vow of fealty to him or face his wrath. |
| 6 | Two [wyverns](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/wyvern.md) soar above the characters, circling them like vultures. After 1 minute, the wyverns swoop down and attack. |
^desert-of-desolation-encounters

### Ghost of Amun Sa

Eventually, the characters come across the ghost of Amun Sa. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A solitary man dressed in tattered clothing appears over the crest of a nearby dune. At first, he seems to shimmer in the heat and desert haze, but as he walks closer, it becomes apparent that he's a ghost.
^2ed

This is the [ghost](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of Amun Sa, former pharaoh of Bakar. He walks in a straight line that intersects the characters' path, shuffling along with a blank gaze like a haunted man.

Amun Sa doesn't notice the characters until he passes within 30 feet of them, at which point he turns to them and relates his sorrowful tale, as if in a trance. Read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I am Amun Sa, son of the house of Mo-Pelar. My spirit has walked these sands for time uncounted in search of mighty heroes, to plead for their aid.
> 
> "In my time, I was pharaoh of this realm. It was green and beautiful, blessed by the gods with magical waters that gave life to our land and nurtured our crops. But I was a foolish and cruel ruler. I should have protected my subjects; instead, I taxed them into poverty to create a wondrous tomb for my own self-preservation. When they rebelled, I cursed them and this land.
> 
> "With my dying breath, the curse was fulfilled, but my soul was cursed as well. I am doomed to walk these sands until a mortal soul retrieves the implements of my power from my tomb: my magic staff and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar. Only then will the curse be lifted, freeing my soul and healing this broken land.
> 
> "Many have tried, and none have succeeded. If you undo my terrible mistake by removing these two precious objects from my tomb, you may keep all the treasure you find within. Follow my path to wealth or woe, to destiny or doom."
^2ee

Amun Sa then turns and walks somberly in the direction of his pyramid. Amun Sa doesn't speak to the characters any further—his curse allows him to share only the tale above. If the characters attempt to harm Amun Sa, he steps into the "Border Ethereal" and continues his solemn march. Amun Sa doesn't harm the party and makes no further attempts to defend himself. If Amun Sa's ghost is slain, he appears to the characters again in 1 hour with no memory of the previous encounter, relating his sad story again.

If the characters follow Amun Sa's ghost, they arrive at his pyramid the next evening. If questioned during the journey, Amun Sa recites his sad speech again, exactly as he did before. In the company of the pharaoh, the remaining trek is safe and uneventful, unless you'd like to add more desert encounters (see the "Desert Encounters" section).

Once Amun Sa arrives at the pyramid, he stops and gestures toward it. He then turns and walks away in search of more travelers.

## Pyramid of Amun Sa

The pyramid of Amun Sa was to be the pharaoh's final resting place. The last remnant of Bakar, it has stood for over a thousand years. When the characters arrive at the pyramid, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Amid the vast desert, a great pyramid rises from the sands, barely touched by time. Stairs ascend from the sand to an opening in the pyramid.
> 
> Near the base of the stairs rests an empty basin one hundred feet in diameter. South of the basin, a deep stone channel cuts a path into the desert ground.
^2f0

The pharaohs of Bakar built pyramids not merely as burial grounds but as part of a sacred process to convey a pharaoh's soul to the afterlife. These monuments also entomb the remains of their consorts and favored leaders, preparing pharaohs and their closest companions to dwell among the gods.

A character who examines the basin and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check recognizes it as the Fountain of Athis, a former wellspring of life and the source of the River Athis. In Bakar's heyday, cool water sprang from the fountain, teleported to it from magical silos within the pyramid.

The Fountain of Athis dried up the night of Amun Sa's death. Only by breaking the pharaoh's curse can the basin resume its flow and the land thrive once more.

### Pyramid Features

The pyramid of Amun Sa is made of weathered limestone. Unless otherwise noted, the pyramid has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceilings in the pyramid's corridors are 10 feet high; those in rooms are 30 feet high.  
- **Doors and Secret Doors.** Doors throughout the pyramid are made of wood and banded with bronze; they have no locks. Secret doors blend in with their surroundings but are obvious from the other side. A character who searches a wall for a secret door must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice it.  
- **Hieroglyphs.** The ancient people of Bakar wrote in hieroglyphs, symbols representing letters, sounds, and words. A character can translate a passage of hieroglyphs with 10 minutes of study and a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check. Passages in different instances of boxed text require separate checks to translate. A creature under the effect of a [Comprehend Languages](Mechanics/spells/comprehend-languages.md) spell can read hieroglyphs instantly (no check required).  
- **Lighting.** The pyramid's rooms are unlit. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Temperature.** The pyramid's interior is perpetually cool and dry, insulated from the desert heat.  
- **Water of Athis.** The River Athis still flows in certain areas of the pyramid. The water ends the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition on any creature that drinks it and removes all levels of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) from the creature. Once a creature benefits from the water, it can't do so again until 24 hours have passed. The water loses its properties if it's bottled or otherwise removed from its source.  

#### Alterations to Magic

The following magical restrictions apply:

- **Teleportation Ward.** Unless the text states otherwise, creatures can't teleport into or out of the pyramid or between its floors. Any attempt to do so is wasted.  
- **Warded Walls.** Magic that would alter the pyramid's stone—such as the [Stone Shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md) or [Passwall](Mechanics/spells/passwall.md) spells—has no effect on the pyramid.  

### False Tomb

The lowest floor of the pyramid is a false tomb designed to discourage would-be tomb robbers. The people of Bakar also once used it as a temple.

The following locations are keyed to map 5.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.1: False Tomb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/076-map-5.01-false-tomb.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/077-map-5.01-false-tomb-player.webp#gallery)

#### P1: Tomb Entrance

The stairs outside the pyramid lead to this outdoor platform. When the characters approach, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Two people stand on a platform at the top of the stairs, flanking the pyramid's arched entrance, which is capped by a stone awning. The figures carry curved swords and are dressed in light, airy attire suited to the desert heat. Each also holds a torch.
^2f5

Two siblings, Atfez and Pachi (neutral good, human [bandit captains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)), stand guard outside the pyramid's entrance, keeping watch for creatures that might disrupt their faction's activities within. Atfez and Pachi are members of the Tears of Athis, a group of historians, priests, and descendants of Bakar who hope to see the River Athis flow once more.

When Atfez and Pachi notice the characters, they're surprised to see other people in the desert, especially at night. Atfez, the more assertive sibling, interrogates the characters about their presence, while Pachi observes and periodically apologizes for her brother's prying. If the characters make it clear they mean no harm, Atfez and Pachi let them enter. Otherwise, they ask the characters to leave, defending themselves as necessary.

#### P2: Main Worship Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The air is cool and still in this vast limestone chamber. Three pillars line each side of the room, and corridors lead to the east and west. A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall. The room is brightly lit by sconces on the pillars.
> 
> An intricate fresco once adorned the walls with artwork and hieroglyphs. Now, much of its plaster lies shattered on the floor. A human woman in priestly robes paces about the room, overseeing five scholars who work to reattach the pieces to the walls.
^2f7

The people of Bakar were meant to pay their respects to the deceased pharaoh here. In the centuries after the fall of Bakar, the walls were destroyed by disgruntled citizens and roaming vandals.

![Iaseda, leader of the Tear...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/078-05-004.iaseda.webp#center "Iaseda, leader of the Tears of Athis, pieces together two shattered fragments of the pyramid's inner halls")

The robed woman is Iaseda (lawful good, human [acolyte](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md)), leader of the Tears of Athis. She is fifty years old and has a calm, determined manner. Around her, five more members of the Tears of Athis (neutral good [scouts](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md)) use a sticky paste to carefully repair the room's plaster walls, which they hope hold clues to restoring the River Athis. If the characters were peaceful toward the guards outside the pyramid, Iaseda is friendly toward them. If the characters pose a threat to the Tears of Athis, Iaseda and her fellow Tears defend themselves and the pyramid fiercely, decrying the characters as defilers.

##### What Iaseda Knows

Iaseda can relay the history of Bakar (detailed in this adventure's background), but she doesn't know about the fate of Amun Sa's spirit or that his ghost wanders the desert. Iaseda can also share information on the following topics:

- **Pyramid.** This pyramid is the tomb of Amun Sa, the last pharaoh of a bygone kingdom known as Bakar that once occupied these lands.  
- **Tears of Athis.** Iaseda leads of the Tears of Athis, a newly formed group of historians, priests, and descendants of the people of Bakar. The Tears of Athis arrived at the pyramid two days ago. They seek to restore the River Athis. Amun Sa built his tomb at the river's source, so it stands to reason the secret to reviving it might be found inside.  
- **Tidings of a Ghost.** If the characters recount their experience with the pharaoh's ghost, Iaseda is skeptical. She jokingly suggests the characters have spent too much time in the desert heat.  
- **Wall Translations.** The Tears of Athis originally brought experts on Bakarian hieroglyphs with them on their expedition. Unfortunately, a purple worm ate those experts. Although the surviving Tears have made good progress reassembling this room's broken plaster, they haven't yet translated any of the hieroglyphs.  

##### Hieroglyphs

The hieroglyphs on the walls were carved by Amun Sa's scribes while he lived, at his dictation. See the "Pyramid Features" section for guidance on translating hieroglyphs throughout the tomb. If translated, the east wall's hieroglyphs read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "I, Amun Sa, set forth a record of myself and of my dealings with this world. Our land is rich with green and fertile fields. The River Athis is the mother of our land, giving life with its waters. Athis nourishes all she touches and gives strength and health to her children. In my youth, my father, the pharaoh, would sit with me beside the spring and tell me stories of the river's wonderful power and the blessings it gives unto this land."
^2fa

If translated, the south wall's hieroglyphs read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "In the years that followed, I learned of the passing of the pharaohs and how our tombs could guarantee a path into our chosen afterlife. I watched as my father built a tomb for himself, to guard against bandits who might plunder his tomb, robbing him of his refuge in the beyond. Yet, only a few years after my father's death, his great burial place was desecrated by thieves. I was tortured by the thought of his spirit wandering the planes alone forever."
^2fb

If translated, the west wall's hieroglyphs read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Cloaked in the darkness of night, I went to my father's tomb to witness the truth with my own eyes. My father's riches were plundered, and the hull of his ship, once jewel-encrusted, was bare and scarred with gouges. I knew with certainty he could not have approached his afterlife in such a boat. As my torch went out, so did the light within my soul. Clutching my staff, I swore by the gods that I would not be cheated of my place in the great beyond. I would build a tomb to end all tombs—one that none could ever despoil."
^2fc

##### Secret Door

The statue of Amun Sa conceals a secret door that leads to area P7.

#### P3: West Offering Temple

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall of this square room, which rises to a domed ceiling. A few tidy cots lie along the floor.
^2ff

The Tears of Athis camp in this room. They sleep here when they're not restoring the walls in area P2.

##### Secret Door

The statue of Amun Sa conceals a door that leads to the hall between areas P5 and P7.

#### P4: East Offering Temple

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A domed ceiling caps this well-lit room. Burning wall sconces illuminate ancient script along the walls. To the north, a twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa, arms outstretched, holds an enormous altar bowl of blazing fire. A stone staircase ascends to the bowl, with hieroglyphs carved into the face of the lowest step.
^302

This room is brightly lit by [Continual Flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells cast on wall sconces. When Amun Sa was interred, his most loyal priests dutifully locked themselves inside the pyramid's upper floors. In the brief period between Amun Sa's death and the collapse of Bakar, the people of Bakar brought food and drink to this room. They believed they were bringing offerings for the gods, but in truth, they were sending sustenance to the priests in the pyramid.

##### Hieroglyphs

If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Lay your offerings of food and drink for the gods in the blazing fire before Amun Sa. That which the gods accept will vanish within the flame."
^304

##### Offering Bowl

The bowl's flame gives off neither heat nor smoke. Whenever an object or creature enters the bowl, the flames surge around the object or creature, concealing it completely and teleporting it to area P13 of the pyramid's second floor. To an onlooker, the object or creature appears to be consumed by the flame, vanishing in an instant. An onlooker who succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can tell that the bowl teleported its contents somewhere else. A [Detect Magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the bowl.

#### P5: West Storage Silo

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The corridor opens into a cylindrical shaft thirty feet in diameter whose slick walls drop into the darkness below. A domed ceiling peaks thirty feet above the floor of the hallway leading to this humid chamber.
^307

The shaft drops 120 feet to the surface of the murky water below, which is 30 feet deep.

##### Water of Athis

The water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) fills the bottom of the silo.

#### P6: East Storage Silo

The thunderous sound of cascading water fills this chamber, which is otherwise identical to area P5.

The shaft drops 120 feet into turbulent white water. Fifty feet below the entrance, water gushes from an opening in the north wall and falls into the reservoir below, which is 30 feet deep.

Before the curse befell Bakar, this silo used to teleport water from this room into the now-dry fountain outside the pyramid. Now, the water merely pours out here and evaporates at an accelerated rate. If the curse is broken, the silo's teleportation functions again.

##### Water of Athis

The water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) fills the bottom of the silo.

#### P7: Worship Room

A twenty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa stands before the north wall of this worship room. There are no hieroglyphs on the walls, and the ceiling is flat.

##### Secret Door

The statue of Amun Sa conceals a secret door that leads to area P8.

#### P8: Descending Corridor

This arched corridor descends at a slight angle toward the false tomb (area P12). A musty smell pervades the hall, and dust covers the floor.

#### P9: Great Worship Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this room are lined with seven statues of Amun Sa: three to the north, two to the east, and two to the west. In the center of the room stands an altar. Side-by-side impressions of a left and right hand are carved into the front of the altar. On the ceiling and along the rest of the walls, the name "Amun Sa" has been carved repeatedly in multiple languages.
^30f

Most of the statues in this worship room are ordinary decor—except for the center statue on the north wall, which can be opened as a typical secret door, and the southernmost statue near the east wall, which swings aside to reveal a hallway once the altar unlocks it (described below).

##### Altar

If a character puts their hands in the altar impressions and says "Amun Sa," the southernmost statue on the eastern wall swings inward to reveal a corridor to area P10.

##### Secret Door

The center statue of Amun Sa on the north wall conceals a secret door that leads to an empty, 15-foot-long corridor with tiny holes in the walls. A character who inspects the corridor's walls and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check can tell that the corridor once contained a sleeping gas trap, but the trap was sprung ages ago.

#### P10: Grand Hallway

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This hallway slopes down at a slight angle. The plaster from the great frescoes that once covered these walls has fallen to rubble. Blade marks cover the walls. The remnants of a broken door lie at the corridor's northern opening. Dust blankets everything, and the air is very dry.
^313

This hall was prepared to fool robbers into thinking the tomb had already been plundered before their arrival. Amun Sa's priests hacked up the decor before the pharaoh was laid to rest.

#### P11: Treasure Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Beyond the broken door is a huge room scattered with broken pots and chests that have been largely hewn into pieces. Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust, apart from a still-intact chest and two vases.
^315

As in area P10, this scene was staged by the priests of Amun Sa long ago. Three hostile [mimics](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md) lie in wait here, disguised as an unbroken chest and a couple of intact vases.

#### P12: Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> In the center of this cool, dark room rests an ornate stone sarcophagus. Its lid is ajar and broken, and it contains nothing but dust. Hieroglyphs appear to have been hastily chiseled into the north wall.
^317

As in area P10, this scene was staged by the priests of Amun Sa during the pyramid's construction.

##### Hieroglyphs

If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Here lies the tomb of Amun Sa. Know that ye have arrived too late To plunder his ransom for heaven's gate."
^319

### Maze of Mists

The second floor of the pyramid is the Maze of Mists: a vast, confounding maze designed to defeat clever intruders who bypass the false tomb by way of the offering bowl in area P4. Amun Sa commissioned an infamous mage named Kordan to create it; Kordan filled the maze's rooms with bloodthirsty creatures and its halls with a disorienting, rust-orange mist.

For each hour the party spends in the Maze of Mists, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Random Maze of Mists Encounters table, rerolling duplicates.

#### P13: Welcome Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This octagonal room has a domed ceiling and smells faintly of sulfur. The scent comes from four doorways spaced evenly around the room. Each doorway is filled with rusty-orange mist. Between the doorways are four levers set into the walls.
> 
> A skeleton lies in the center of the room, loosely gripping a sword that points at one of the doorways.
^31c

The skeleton belonged to a Humanoid explorer; its sword points toward the west exit. Characters teleported to this level by the bowl of magical fire in the east offering room (area P4) might be disoriented and not know which direction is north.

- **Magnetic Trap.** Lifting any of the levers along the walls triggers a magnetic trap within the chamber's ceiling. Each creature in the room wearing metal armor is pulled up to the 30-foot-high ceiling, as are any metal objects or weapons that aren't being worn or carried. A creature affected by the magnetic field collides with the ceiling; the creature takes 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and has the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) and [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions until the field is deactivated.  

To deactivate the magnetic field, all the levers in the room must be reset to their downward position, at which point creatures and objects naturally fall to the floor. Casting [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the ceiling deactivates the magnetic field permanently. The levers are lightweight and easily maneuvered. A creature can attempt to move a lever by hitting it with a ranged attack; each lever has Armor Class 10, and on a hit, the attack deals no damage and instead switches the lever's position.

#### P14: Mists and Corridors

Sections of these hallways are filled with an orange mist (marked on map 5.2). The first time a character enters one of these misty areas, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> As you enter the rust-orange mist, the scent of sulfur floods your nostrils. You feel slightly lightheaded. This mist confuses your faculties and sense of direction.
^31e

The mists heavily obscure vision and magically disorient those inside them. Such creatures lose all sense of distance and direction while in the mists. Creatures feeling their way along the walls find their sense of touch numbed, so they're never quite sure if they rounded a corner or continued straight.

Because of these effects, don't show players the shape or size of any of the mist-filled hallways or tell them what direction they're traveling. When the characters emerge in different rooms of the maze or gaps in the mist, describe areas in terms of "left" or "right" rather than cardinal directions.

The contents of the areas between the mists are detailed below.

##### P14a

A leather sack containing 102 gp lies against one wall of this corridor.

##### P14b

A [+1 Warhammer](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) lies near a heavy plank door in this clear stretch of corridor.

##### P14c

A tiny ring made of fine silver lies on the floor in the center of this corridor. The ring is a cursed [Ring of Feather Falling](Mechanics/items/ring-of-feather-falling.md). Attuning to the ring extends its curse to the wearer, who suffers the following effect:

- **Curse of Ill Temper.** You are overcome with an urge to disagree with others' actions, ideas, and opinions.  

While cursed in this way, the wearer is unwilling to part with the ring. A [Remove Curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic breaks the curse.

##### P14d

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher detect a cool, fresh breeze from the east.

##### P14e

The words "Knock First" have been carved in Common into a heavy plank door. The bandits in the room beyond (see area P16) wrote this to try to dupe intruders into announcing their presence.

##### P14f

A cool, fresh breeze flows out from under the door, and a character listening at the door hears tumbling torrents of water.

##### P14g

Lying on the floor is the skeleton of a person who died while pulling a cart loaded with three chests stacked atop each other. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher detect the stench of rotten flesh from the north.

If the top chest is opened, it sprays poisoned darts in all directions. Each creature within 10 feet of the chest must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2 (`1d4`) piercing damage and 28 (`8d6`) poison damage and has the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

The bottom two chests each contain 250 gp.

##### P14h

This area reeks of dead flesh. Bodies in various states of decay lie strewn about the floor. In the center lies the corpse of a human. A shimmering axe juts from his chest.

The axe is a [Berserker Axe](Mechanics/items/berserker-axe.md). The weapon's name ("Enduval") is inscribed into the blade. The axe stops shimmering once it's removed from the corpse.

##### P14i

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher detect the stench of decaying flesh from the south.

##### P14j

Characters who have a passive Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 15 or higher detect the stench of decaying flesh from the west.

##### P14k

A leather knapsack lies on the floor next to a door. It contains a [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Fly](Mechanics/spells/fly.md), a [Spell Scroll](Mechanics/items/spell-scroll-dmg.md) of [Fireball](Mechanics/spells/fireball.md), and a pouch containing 30 pp.

##### P14l

A [Ring of Protection](Mechanics/items/ring-of-protection.md) sits on the floor of this clear section of corridor.

##### P14m

A trail of gold pieces on the east side of this corridor leads to the north archway, where it ends. The total value of the coins is 137 gp.

##### P14n

A trail of platinum pieces starts in the center of the corridor and leads to the west archway, where it ends. The total value of the coins is 152 pp.

#### P15: Grieving Elves

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Humanoid bones litter the floor of this room, along with the tattered remnants of adventurers' clothing. Five elves dressed in similar attire kneel over the bones, speaking solemn prayers in mourning.
^32e

The "elves" are five [doppelgangers](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) that devoured a group of adventurers in this room four days ago; like the characters, those adventurers sought to break the pharaoh's curse. The doppelgangers then took on the adventurers' appearances.

The doppelgangers play the role of grieving elves who have just found the bones of their long-lost kin, reading the characters' thoughts to gain their pity and trust. The doppelgangers claim to know the trick to solving the maze: send two people ahead through the mists with a rope for the others to follow. They gladly volunteer to send one of their own as a guide along with one of the characters.

The doppelgangers aim to isolate the characters, slowly assuming their identities until none remain.

#### P16: Knock, Knock

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A few cots lie scattered around this room, as well as a few packs of supplies. Several humans dressed in dirty adventuring gear and green bandannas rest here.
^330

Seven human [bandits](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) camp in this room. They are led by Cateline and Imbert (chaotic neutral, human [bandit captains](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)). The bandits are part of a thieving troupe called the Hands of Plenty. Dirty, sweaty, and tired, the bandits are initially indifferent toward the characters. If the characters knocked on the door before entering, the bandits have their weapons at the ready. Otherwise, they are arguing loudly.

##### Parleying with the Bandits

If the characters don't attack, the bandits are relieved to see them. The Hands of Plenty came to this pyramid days ago, intending to raid it for treasure, but they quickly became lost. Now they just want to find their way out. None of the bandits have encountered the ghost of Amun Sa—they don't even know who he is.

Tired of wandering the pyramid, Cateline and Imbert grudgingly suggest a temporary alliance between the characters and the Hands of Plenty. If the characters agree, the Hands of Plenty accompany the characters and fight alongside them. However, if any of the bandits come across treasure worth 100 gp or more, their greed overwhelms them, and they attack the characters to claim the treasure for themselves.

##### Treasure

Cateline and Imbert each carry 40 gp. The other seven bandits each carry 10 gp.

#### P17: Rug Room

An oversized chest sits atop a beautiful rug in this dome-ceilinged room. The rug beneath the chest is a [rug of smothering](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/rug-of-smothering.md).

If the chest or the rug is disturbed, the rug slips from beneath the chest and attacks. At the same time, the chest opens to reveal three more [rugs of smothering](Mechanics/bestiary/construct/rug-of-smothering.md) that unfurl themselves and join the fight. Apart from these rugs, the chest is empty.

#### P18: Well of Questions

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A sphinx lounges on a wide platform at the far end of this chamber, her wings folded neatly at her side. Her tail flicks back and forth as she stares at you intently.
> 
> Water surges from a well in the middle of the room, flowing into a trough on the floor, across the room, and into to an opening below the sphinx's platform.
^335

A [gynosphinx](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/gynosphinx.md) named Senenura resides in this room. Initially indifferent to the characters, she asks them what they are doing here, then she makes them an offer. If the characters can answer a riddle, Senenura promises to answer one question they have about the tomb. She warns, however, that if the characters don't answer correctly, she will eat them. The characters need to accept or decline the offer before knowing the riddle.

##### Sphinx's Riddle

Senenura's riddle is as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Too much, and you wither; too little, and you shiver. I'm slow in the summer, and hasty in winter. What am I?"
^337

*Answer: The answer is the sun.*

##### Answered Correctly

If the characters answer the riddle correctly, Senenura keeps her promise to answer one question they have about the tomb.

The sphinx is knowledgeable about the following topics:

- Everything in this adventure's background  
- All the creatures and traps within the pyramid  
- All the maze's exits, including those in this room  
- Where Amun Sa's staff and star-gem are kept (areas P67 and P68, respectively)  
- The mummy lord [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md) and his descent into evil  

##### Answered Incorrectly

If the characters answer the riddle incorrectly, Senenura attacks and fights ferociously to the death.

##### Trough

The circular opening at the base of the sphinx's platform is 5 feet in diameter. Medium and smaller creatures that fall into the trough must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be swept into this opening, which empties into area P6.

See diagram 5.1 for a cross-section of this area and its waterways.

##### Water of Athis

The water in this chamber is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

##### Well

Any character who looks into the well sees a 10-foot-diameter tunnel below the surface that enters the well from the east side. Water flows into the well through this tunnel. Though the volume of water is high, the well's large size makes the current slow and swimmable. This water tunnel angles up to area P29 on the third floor.

#### P19: Spear Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Little holes honeycomb the right wall of this square room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. Steel spears pin four humanoid skeletons to the left wall, and a chest sits on the far end of the room.
^33e

This room contains a brutal spear trap.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53a).

##### Spear Trap

Ninety of the one hundred holes in the south wall contain a hidden spear held in place by magic. When a creature enters this room, and every minute afterward until no living creatures or spears remain, ten of the spears shoot from the wall. Creatures in the room when the spears are released must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (`8d6`) piercing damage, is pinned to the north wall, and has the [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 15). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

##### Treasure

The unlocked chest contains 250 pp.

#### P20: X-Room

A giant *X* has been shallowly carved into the floor of this square room. A narrow ledge encircles the base of the room's domed ceiling.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53b).

##### Stone Block Trap

A character who searches the room for traps and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the outline of a 10-foot-square hatch in the ceiling. It is directly above the X, which marks a pressure plate in the floor.

Any weight in excess of 40 pounds placed on the *X* releases a 10-foot-square stone block from the hatch overhead. Creatures below the block when it drops must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space. On a failed save, it takes 55 (`10d10`) bludgeoning damage and has the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) and [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions as it is pinned under the block. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to free itself or another creature from the block, ending both conditions on a success. The block weighs 2,000 pounds.

#### P21: Pendulum Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rope hangs from the ceiling of this room; its lower end is tied to the wall facing the doorway. At the other end is a gigantic, bladed pendulum. A narrow ledge encircles the base of the room's domed ceiling.
^346

An [invisible stalker](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/invisible-stalker.md) lurks in this room. When two or more creatures enter the room, the invisible stalker severs the pendulum's rope, causing the blade to sweep down at them. It then attempts to [shove](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Shove) creatures into the blade's path.

##### Pendulum

If the rope securing the pendulum is cut, the blade swings down toward the door and back again. A creature in the swinging blade's path must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) slashing damage. The blade swings again on initiative count 20 of each round (losing initiative ties), and the damage on subsequent rounds is reduced by `1d10`. When the number of damage dice reaches 0, the blade stops.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53c).

![Bloodthirsty minotaurs sta...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/081-05-005.minotaur.webp#center "Bloodthirsty minotaurs stalk the Maze of Mists, hacking trespassers to bits with wicked-looking axes")

#### P22: Minotaur Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this room are splattered with dried blood. There is a ten-foot-diameter hole in the ceiling. Piled beneath it is a large mound of straw.
> 
> Three hulking creatures with humanoid bodies, bulls' heads, and piercing red eyes pace around this room, snorting aggressively with axes in hand.
^34a

The three [minotaurs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) in this room attack on sight. Summoned by the mage who created the maze, the minotaurs are Fiends instead of Monstrosities. They know nothing of Amun Sa and seek only to spill the blood of trespassers in the maze. The minotaurs are immune to the mists' disorienting effect.

##### Ceiling Shaft

The hole in the ceiling leads to a 30-foot-long vertical shaft covered by a trapdoor in a temple on the pyramid's third floor (area P52).

##### Treasure

Scattered in the hay are 1,800 gp.

#### P23: Darkness Room

Magical darkness fills this room. A [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell cast on the darkness dispels it, as does the [Daylight](Mechanics/spells/daylight.md) spell.

A locked chest rests against the west wall. Two [black puddings](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/black-pudding.md) cling to the ceiling above it. The oozes drop from the ceiling to ambush any creature that approach the chest.

##### Treasure

The chest holds three identical bottles: two [Potions of Healing](Mechanics/items/potion-of-healing.md) and a [Potion of Poison](Mechanics/items/potion-of-poison.md).

#### P24: Robber Press

This room was designed to grind intruders to a pulp. It appears empty, except for a small leather knapsack that sits at the far end of the room.

- **Compacting Wall Trap.** When a Small or larger creature ventures more than 10 feet into the room, the door slams shut and locks itself, and the walls to the east and west begin to close in. Roll initiative. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), creatures between the walls take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage and have the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition as they're slowly crushed by the walls. The walls continue to compress for 3 rounds.  

A creature within 5 feet of the door can try to open it by using its action to make a DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check with thieves' tools to bypass the lock or a DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to force open the door.

A creature in the room can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to hold the walls apart until the start of its next turn. On a successful check, creatures take no damage from the walls and don't have the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition during that time.

After 3 rounds, the walls return to their initial positions, ending the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition on creatures still between them. The door then unlocks.

- **Illusory Knapsack.** The knapsack is an illusion to lure creatures into the room. A character who examines the knapsack can determine it's an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check or by physically interacting with it.  

#### P25: Suspiciously Empty Room

This large square room has a domed ceiling and is completely empty. There is nothing of note here.

#### P26: Pole Forest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Like a forest of narrow wooden poles, dozens of long spears protrude from holes in the floor toward this room's domed ceiling, which is encircled by a narrow ledge. The skeleton of a dwarf in chain mail is pinned to the ceiling. The dwarf's pack was ripped open by one of the spears, spilling a pile of jewels on the floor.
^352

Characters can pass through the room by hacking a path through the spears. The spears are easily felled, but doing so is noisy. Roll on the Random Maze of Mist Encounters table (detailed earlier in this section) to determine what creatures arrive to investigate the noise.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53d).

##### Treasure

Spilled amid the poles are five jacinth gems worth 300 gp each.

#### P27: Flameskull Room

Three [flameskulls](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) fly in circles around this room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. The flameskulls attack intruders on sight.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (area P53e).

#### P28: Loose Ceiling

A [cloaker](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/cloaker.md) camouflaged to match the stonework lies flush against the ceiling of this room, whose domed ceiling is encircled by a narrow ledge. The cloaker attacks the first creature that enters the chamber.

##### Secret Door

A secret door atop this room's 30-foot-high ledge leads to an observation dome on the third floor of the pyramid (see area P53f).

### Halls of the Upper Priesthood

The third floor of the pyramid was known as the Halls of the Upper Priesthood. All the Undead on this level were priests of Amun Sa until the former high priest, [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md), corrupted their souls and cursed them with undeath.

For each hour the party spends on this floor, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. To determine what the characters encounter, roll on the Random Upper Priesthood Encounters table, rerolling duplicates.

**Random Upper Priesthood Encounters**

#### P29: Waterway

If the party enters this area from the tunnel in the Well of Questions (area P18), read or paraphrase:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You surface in a tumbling, turbulent pool of water within a ten-foot-square shaft that ascends forty feet from the surface of the water. The air is damp, and the walls are covered with slimy green moss.
> 
> Dim light streams from an archway near the top of one side of the shaft. A narrow, roaring waterfall pours from the archway into the pool.
^35b

If the party enters this area from the hall (areas P30–P31), read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The corridor ends in an archway followed by a steep drop. The water falls over the edge into a murky pool at the bottom of a deep moss-covered shaft.
^35c

Handholds line the walls. Characters can climb this shaft without needing to make any checks.

##### Water of Athis

The waterway is filled with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

#### P30: North Entry

A compass rose is carved into the floor of this arched corridor. The compass rose is accurate and can help reorient characters exiting the maze on the pyramid's second floor.

##### Water of Athis

An aqueduct fills half the corridor, carrying the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) toward area P29.

#### P31: Long Hall

This long hallway rises steadily toward area P32. Bright light shines from the hallway's southern end.

##### Water of Athis

An aqueduct carries the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section) from the stream in the garden hall (area P32) to the north, where it surges high against the wall before following the corridor's sharp turn to the east.

#### P32: Garden Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rapid stream runs through this brilliantly lit indoor garden. The room's domed ceiling glows with warm light, giving life to the lush plants along the stream. Nestled among the ferns, flowers, and palm trees in the garden are two enormous bronze bowls filled with leafy pomegranates, pears, figs, and dates.
^363

Sunlight beams down from this room's ceiling.

##### Secret Doors

The foliage hides secret doors: one in the southwest alcove to area P34 and another in the southeast alcove to area P35. The greenery raises the DC to find these doors to 20.

##### Fruit Bowls

If the characters approach or disturb a fruit bowl, the magical fruits in the bowls spread their leaves like wings and take flight in all directions like insects. There are fifty flying fruits in all.

A character more than 20 feet off the ground—such as one climbing a palm tree, flying, or leaping into the air—can use an action to try to snatch a flying fruit from the air, doing so with a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. Alternatively, a character can shoot down a flying fruit by hitting it with a ranged attack roll; each fruit has Armor Class 18. Once plucked from the air or shot down, a flying fruit becomes inanimate.

A creature that eats a flying fruit has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws for the next 8 hours. The flying fruit tastes like a deliciously sweet fruit of its apparent variety. If a flying fruit is taken out of the pyramid, it loses its magic and rots 1 minute later.

##### Water of Athis

The stream flows with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

#### P33: Dome of Flight

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this octagonal room rise high to a domed ceiling that glows with warm light. A waterfall tumbles into the room from the mouth of a stone-carved lion's head, emptying into a stream that flows through the north entrance. A door sits high on the south wall above the lion's head, opening onto a narrow ledge that encircles the base of the domed ceiling.
> 
> Four palm trees stand in the room, and clusters of pineapples grow from their leafy tops. Two identical granite altars sit on the east and west sides of a pool. Each altar is carved with the impression of a right hand, a left hand, and gold-lined hieroglyphs. Thick foliage shrouds doors to the east and west.
^368

This chamber's ceiling is 60 feet high and radiates sunlight. The door atop the ledge leads to area P55, while an archway concealed behind the waterfall leads to area P44.

See diagram 5.2 for a cross-section of this room.

##### Altars

These identical magic altars were used to lift the pharaoh's heavy sarcophagus to the next level of the tomb. Each bears three hieroglyphs. If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section; treat the hieroglyphs as a single passage), the hieroglyphs read "float," "reverse," and "negate."

If a creature touches both of the hand-shaped impressions, the impressions begin to glow as the altars activate. From then on, any creature in the room can use a bonus action to say one of the following words to cause its corresponding effect:

- **"Float.** " Gravity in this room becomes half as strong as normal. Creatures' jump distances are doubled in this room, and creatures and objects that fall descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from the fall. Water still flows down the waterfall and through the stream, but at a slower rate than before. This effect can exist simultaneously with the "reverse" effect.  
- **"Reverse.** " The entire room is affected by a [Reverse Gravity](Mechanics/spells/reverse-gravity.md) spell. The waterfall flows upward, exposing the hidden archway to area P44 and forming an upside-down pond in the ceiling. This effect can exist simultaneously with the "float" effect.  
- **"Negate.** " If the "float" or "reverse" effects are active, they end immediately. The impressions on the altars stop glowing, and the altars deactivate.  

##### Grenade Palms

The trees are grenade palms, bearing explosive fruits that look like pineapples. The palms evolved this way so they could scatter their seeds far and wide. A character who examines the trees and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) check recognizes this rare plant.

When a creature comes within 5 feet of a grenade palm, the vibrations of the creature's movements loosen one of the explosive fruits overhead. The fruit lands near the base of the tree and bursts in a blast of woody shrapnel. Each creature within 20 feet of the fruit must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As an action, character can safely pick a fruit from the tree by gently twisting it off the branches with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. The character can hurl the fruit up to 60 feet as an action, causing it to burst on impact.

The fruit can be stowed for later use, but doing so is dangerous. If a creature carrying a fruit is hit by an attack or is otherwise jostled, the fruit explodes.

##### Tapping Noise

A character who stands on the ledge or domed ceiling and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check hears a faint tapping noise coming from the dome's east side. This sound is a gnome named Prit (see area P54), rapping on the other side of the wall with a spoon. This section of the wall has Armor Class 17, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying the wall creates an opening to area P54.

##### Water of Athis

The water in this room is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

#### P34: Gazelle-Headed Statue

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A nine-foot-tall statue of a gazelle-headed woman stands in this alcove. She raises a finger to her mouth.
^36e

This statue depicts a god of knowledge unique to the people of Bakar. A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows this god prizes secrets.

##### Treasure

If a character tells the statue a secret, a [Potion of Resistance (necrotic)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-necrotic-resistance.md) glitters into existence at the statue's feet. This happens only once.

#### P35: Tortoise-Headed Statue

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A nine-foot-tall stone statue of a tortoise-headed man stands in this alcove. He holds a hand up to his ear.
^371

This statue depicts a god of art unique to the people of Bakar. A character who inspects the statue and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Religion)) check knows this god enjoys music.

##### Treasure

If a character sings a song or plays a tune before the statue, a [Potion of Resistance (necrotic)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-necrotic-resistance.md) glitters into existence at the statue's feet. This happens only once.

#### P36: West Chamber

Four leather sacks sit on the floor of this 20-foot-long hallway. Each of the sacks contains 100 gp.

#### P37: East Chamber

The slain bodies of two wights, defeated by Uma and her companions (see area P47), lie sprawled on the floor of this long chamber. A character who inspects the wights notices marks left by swords and arrows on the corpses.

#### P38: West Hall

Two [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) haunt this hallway like sentries. A character looking to traverse the hall undetected must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check.

#### P39: East Hall

This quiet hall is empty. Streaks of decades-old dried blood mar the walls and floor.

#### P40: West Kitchen

This room is a long-abandoned kitchen, its counters and cutlery coated in a thick layer of dust. In the center of the room, a heavy wooden block has a cleaver stuck into it. The cleaver, which is made of fine silver, functions as a silvered handaxe.

#### P41: West Pantry

This pantry is barren. As offerings to the pyramid declined, the priests of Amun Sa ran out of food.

> [!gallery]
> ![Diagram 5.2: Dome of Flight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/084-map-5.05-dome-of-flight-map.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/085-map-5.05-dome-of-flight-map-player.webp#gallery)

#### P42: East Kitchen

A dwarf skeleton with a cleaver lodged in its chest lies on a wooden table in this dusty, long-abandoned kitchen. All the kitchen's spoons are missing. They were taken by Prit the gnome (see area P54).

#### P43: East Pantry

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Piles of plaster—the remnants of long-shattered frescoes—line the walls of this room. No readable pieces are left. Empty flour sacks litter the floor. The room's domed ceiling bears several wide cracks.
^37b

This pantry is barren. As offerings to the pyramid declined, the priests of Amun Sa ran out of food.

##### Ceiling Passageway

Characters who look closely at the cracks in the ceiling see a rough-hewn tunnel rising from one of the larger cracks. The tunnel winds its way to area P64. It was dug with a spoon by Prit, the gnome in area P54.

#### P44: March of the True Faith

Hieroglyphs cover the ceiling and floor of this corridor. Chiseled by a scribe to please the pyramid's former high priest, [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md), the hieroglyphs also tell the story of Nafik's evil designs.

If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs on the ceiling read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Above our thoughts the pharaoh sleeps, In dreamy realms and sky so deep. The high priest worked a wonder great, And sealed him up into his fate. Great Nafik, the priest most high, Studies tomes that he might ply The watery path where all the great Leave death behind and loose their fate."
^37e

If translated, the hieroglyphs on the floor read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Nafik was high priest of Amun Sa and leader of his rites. He was keeper of the tomes of Terbakar, the greatest library in all lands of the golden age.
> 
> "Nafik searched, too, for life eternal, and some say he sought to rob the pharaohs of their right to that life. But I believe he sought only to serve.
> 
> "Nafik's search was rewarded, for the books showed him the way of life eternal here. Now great and terrible in his power, he hopes to share this gift with us.
> 
> "He cannot die, for he has sequestered his life elsewhere. Nafik is now second only to the gods themselves. He alone has claim on the rule of Bakar."
^37f

#### P45: North Priesthood Cells

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This long corridor has a wooden door at each end. Ancient, rotting black drapes hang loosely over the entrances to four small rooms on each side of the hall.
^381

The cells contain only dirt and broken cots.

#### P46: West Closet

Two unfinished sarcophagi face each other from opposite ends of this long chamber. Two [mummies](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/mummy.md) lurk inside the sarcophagi, lurching forth to attack any creatures that enter the room.

#### P47: West Cell of the High Priest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The din of battle rises from this room. A heavily armored woman armed with a gleaming sword valiantly battles a horde of gaunt, gray creatures with sharp claws and long, ghastly tongues.
^384

A human [knight](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) named Uma is fighting seven [ghasts](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/ghast.md) in this octagonal room. Two slain ghasts lie at her feet. If the characters don't immediately join her in battle, Uma shouts for their aid when she notices them.

If the characters help Uma fight off the ghasts, she regards them as comrades. Thankful for their efforts, Uma offers to join the characters if they help her exit the tomb.

##### What Uma Knows

In addition to the history of Bakar (detailed in this adventure's background), Uma can impart the following information:

- **Amun Sa's Ghost.** Twelve days ago, Uma traveled to the desert with a group of adventurers on a quest for a magic amulet. To their surprise, Uma and her companions were approached by the spirit of Amun Sa. They heeded his plea and entered this pyramid, looking to retrieve his staff and star-gem.  
- **Encounter with a Mummy.** Five days ago, Uma and her companions cornered a mummy garbed in tattered high priest's robes near a waterfall not far from here (see area P33). A fierce battle ensued, and Uma's comrades were slain. Uma struck a killing blow on the undead priest—or so she thought. As the mummy crumbled to dust, he claimed his life was "too precious a thing to carry with him," cackling as he disappeared. Uma can show the characters the way to the waterfall.  
- **Uma's Fallen Comrades.** Uma laid her companions to rest in a hallway of black curtains (area P51). Since then, she has been surviving on rations, but her supplies are running low. She doesn't know how to get to the tomb's next level.  

![Uma, a valiant warrior who...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/086-05-006.uma.webp#center "Uma, a valiant warrior who headed Amun Sa's call, fends off a horde of ghasts")

#### P48: Priest Catacombs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A giant block of black stone lined with twelve upright sarcophagi sits in the center of this huge room. The faces that were carved into the lids of the sarcophagi have been gouged out by deep claw marks.
^387

The sarcophagi are actually doors to the inside of the stone block, which is hollow. Five [wights](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wight.md) lurk within. They rush out to attack the characters as soon as any of the lids are opened.

##### Treasure

An unlocked chest inside the stone block contains 800 gp.

#### P49: East Closet

Two sarcophagi face each other from either end of this room. Their carved faces have ominous expressions. An inanimate skeleton falls out of the northern sarcophagus when it's opened.

##### Secret Door

Inside the southern sarcophagus is a secret door that leads to a dead end.

#### P50: East Cell of the High Priest

Three [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) float within this room. When the characters enter, the wraiths are hissing at a holy-looking mace on the floor. The wraiths attack the characters on sight.

##### Treasure

The mace is a [Mace of Disruption](Mechanics/items/mace-of-disruption.md) that belonged to an honorable warrior who braved Amun Sa's tomb years ago and perished. The weapon's name ("Bar-ethel") is inscribed in its hilt.

#### P51: South Priesthood Cells

This area's description is identical to that of area P45. However, three corpses have been laid behind the curtain in the northeastern-most cell. A moth-eaten blanket reverently covers each body, and a single, unlit candle rests before them.

The bodies are former adventurers and friends of Uma (see area P47), who dragged her comrades' bodies here to give them a proper burial and hide them from the Undead on this floor.

#### P52: Prayer Temple of the Priesthood

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Faded and moth-eaten prayer rugs are neatly placed about this room. In the center of the south wall is a thirty-foot-tall statue of Amun Sa with a giant gemstone glimmering from his forehead. A compass rose is carved into the floor before the statue.
^38f

The compass rose is accurate and can help reorient characters who lost track of the cardinal directions in the maze on the second floor.

##### Gemstone Trap

If the gemstone is removed from the statue's forehead, the statue makes a horrendous noise like a foghorn until the gem is put back or the statue is destroyed. The statue has Armor Class 17, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The noise attracts nearby creatures. Roll on the Random Upper Priesthood Encounters table (detailed earlier in this section) to determine what creatures arrive to investigate the noise.

##### Trapdoor

A hidden, 10-foot-wide trapdoor sits between the compass rose and the statue. A character who examines the floor and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots the trapdoor. A creature that steps onto the trapdoor falls 40 feet into the haystack in area P22, taking no damage from the fall.

> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/088-map-5.06-observation-dome-map-player.webp#gallery)

##### Treasure

The "gemstone" in the statue's forehead is made of glass and worth only 1 gp. Characters who have proficiency with jeweler's tools recognize this, as does anyone who holds it and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

#### P53: Observation Domes

Dark, dusty corridors lead to these domes, whose doors open onto the ledges over various rooms in the Maze of Mists. Priests used them to pass idle hours watching the deaths of grave robbers below.

See diagram 5.3 for a cross-section of a typical observation dome and its view over the area below.

##### P53a

This dome opens over room P19.

##### P53b

This dome opens over room P20.

##### P53c

This dome opens over room P21.

##### P53d

This dome opens over room P26.

##### P53e

This dome opens over room P27.

##### P53f

This dome opens over room P28.

### Gauntlet

This floor of the pyramid—the Gauntlet—served as a last line of defense between intruders and the pharaoh's tomb. It also served as the quarters of the pyramid's former high priest, [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md).

The following locations are keyed to map 5.4.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.4: Gauntlet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/089-map-5.07-gauntlet.webp#gallery)

#### P54: Prit's Tunnel

If the party discovers this tunnel by traveling from the Heart's Lair (area P64), read or paraphrase:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this tunnel are rough and narrow, as if dug by a small creature. At the end of the tunnel stands a gnome, humming happily to himself as he chips away at the wall with a spoon.
^39c

If the party discovers this tunnel by breaking down the wall in the Dome of Flight (area P33), read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> When the dust clears, a surprised gnome stands in a rough-hewn tunnel before you, holding a dingy spoon.
^39d

This squirrelly gnome [commoner](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) is named Prit. He snuck into the tomb five years ago to admire its architecture and has been happily tunneling through these ruins ever since. Prit is obsessed with spoons and doesn't know much about anything else. He does know that down the rough-hewn corridor behind him there's "a weird little treasure" (see area P64). Prit doesn't elaborate further, electing to show the characters the spoons he has collected instead.

##### Treasure

Prit carries a collection of one hundred and twelve spoons in his backpack. Many are mundane, but others are historical curios. If sold to the right buyer, the collection could fetch up to 350 gp, but Prit doesn't part with it willingly.

#### P55: Entry Corridor

An unsettling chill pervades this branching corridor. The two doors to the south are identical. They are both made of thick wood and bear gold hieroglyphs.

##### Hieroglyphs

If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Beyond these doors lies the great Nafik, once second only to the pharaoh—now second only to the gods."
^3a1

#### P56: Gauntlet of the True Way

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The well-lit hall before you is vast and majestic, rising at a slight angle toward the south. Wall torches light four flights of stairs that connect wide landings. Water thunders in torrents past both sides of the stairs and underneath these landings. At the top of the stairs is a platform, on which rests a giant bronze forearm with an upraised fist.
> 
> An imposing figure stands beside this bronze arm. He is wrapped almost entirely in tattered priestly attire that trails at his feet, but a few gaps between the wrappings reveal his rotting, desiccated skin.
> 
> The figure casts his gaze at you and says in a raspy voice, "Foolish beings of living flesh, your journey ends here. Once, I was the pharaoh's high priest—but now, I enjoy immortality that even he could never hope to attain. Revel in this moment: the rushing water of Athis, the smell of burning torches. It is the last scene you will ever witness."
^3a3

[Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md), the heartless former high priest of Amun Sa, stands at the top of the stairs. As soon as Nafik is done monologuing—or if his speech is interrupted—he attacks.

If the characters try to explain to Nafik that Amun Sa sent them, he responds that the pharaoh is dead. Nafik considers himself the rightful inheritor of the tomb, its contents, and the kingdom of Bakar.

![Nafik, the undead former h...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/091-05-007.nafik.webp#center "Nafik, the undead former high priest of Amun Sa, spews a dastardly monologue in the Gauntlet of the True Way")

##### Bronze Arm

When combat begins, the bronze arm atop the stairs animates to defend Nafik. On initiative count 20 of each round (losing initiative ties), Nafik can command the arm to grab or push a creature of his choice that he can see within 10 feet of the arm. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [grappled](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 15) or is pushed into the rapids below (Nafik's choice). The arm has Armor Class 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

##### Destroying Nafik

Nafik's heart resides in area P64. To vanquish the high priest for good, the characters must first destroy his heart. If Nafik is reduced to 0 hit points while his heart remains intact, he cackles and crumbles to ash, knowing he will rise again. If his heart was previously destroyed, Nafik's lifeless body slumps to the floor, his face twisted into a permanent scowl.

##### Gauntlet

Each landing in this chamber has an effect that triggers when a creature other than Nafik steps foot on it. Each effect triggers only once.

From north to south, the landings' effects are as follows:

- **North Landing.** Two [ochre jellies](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) ooze from small holes in the east and west alcoves of this landing. They are loyal to Nafik and fight to the death.  
- **Center Landing.** A 30-foot-tall, 50-foot-wide wall of flame erupts from the floor in the middle of this landing, dividing the northern and southern halves of the room. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled by a [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell (DC 15). A creature that passes through the wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **South Landing.** A number of [shadows](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) equal to the number of characters appear from the southernmost alcoves. Each shadow is a wispy duplicate of a character intent on killing its original.  

If the characters entered from the south, or if they don't try to ascend the stairs, Nafik can instead trigger one of these effects at the start of his turn (no action required). He can trigger each effect only once.

##### Rapids

Two 10-foot-deep aqueducts surge with water 10 feet below the landings. This water is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

A creature that falls into an aqueduct is swept to the northern end of the room and slams against the ledge face, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. A creature can climb from the water level onto the north landing without needing to make any checks.

Water flows into the room from area P57, entering through a forked, 10-foot-wide channel beneath the frothy rapids. It flows out through sturdy grates in the northern ledge face, eventually emerging from the lion's head spout in area P33.

#### P57: Pillar of Athis

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ten-foot-diameter column of water thunders down from the ceiling of this semicircular room, pouring into an opening in the floor.
^3a9

If the characters visit this room before destroying [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md) and his heart (see areas P56 and P64), the chamber is covered with thick grime. A deep voice emanates from the water column and utters the following message in Common:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A terrible evil befouls this place. A wicked priest haunts these halls, his heart preserved in glass by foul magic. Those who end his undeath may return and face the Trial of Truth."
^3aa

Once Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, the grime in this room disappears to reveal a question mark engraved in the floor before the column.

##### Column of Water

This water column flows with the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section). A creature that steps into the column is abruptly swept through a duct into the rapids in area P56.

##### Trial of Truth

If a creature asks a question in this room after Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, a deep voice speaks from the column and asks three questions. The questions are as follows:

- "What is your name?"  
- "What is your quest?"  
- "On whose hallowed ground do you stand?" (The answer is "Amun Sa's.")  

If a creature answers any of the questions inaccurately or lies, lightning leaps from the column of water toward that creature. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (`10d8`) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a question is answered truthfully, the voice proceeds to the next question until all three are answered.

After all three questions have been answered truthfully, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Put your hand in mine," says the column. A glowing impression of a hand appears on the floor before it.
^3ad

If a character places a hand into the impression, the water column flows backward for the next 10 minutes. Creatures that enter the column are gently ushered up to area P65.

#### P58: Reading Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls, ceiling, and floor of this room are made of marble. They might once have been beautiful, but now they're covered in cobwebs, dirt, and grime. An old, scorched book lies on a marble slab in the center of the room.
^3af

This untitled book details how one can become a mummy lord through a complex ritual that involves numerous unspeakable acts and vile ingredients. Some of its pages are burnt and illegible, while others have been torn out.

[Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md) tried to transform himself into a mummy lord using this book's ritual, but he lacked the requisite time and ingredients. His botched ritual transformed him into an unholy creature and his most loyal priests into Undead.

#### P59: Stagnant Pool

A pool of stagnant water rests in this octagonal room. Three hostile [water weirds](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-weird.md) lurk in the pool.

##### Treasure

A waterproof bag containing 110 pp lies at the bottom of the pool, obscured by the water's grimy surface. Once Nafik and his heart have been destroyed, the grime in this room disappears.

#### P60: Sitting Room

This octagonal room holds a bench, a chair, and a rug. The room otherwise contains nothing of value.

#### P61: Dining Room

Cobwebs cover this grand dining room for Amun Sa's priests. Characters who peruse the room's cabinets notice all the spoons are missing. They were taken by Prit the gnome (see area P54).

##### Treasure

The ornate plates and silverware in this room are worth a total of 110 gp.

#### P62: Storage Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The north wall of this room has been broken through, with rubble and dirt piled on the floor. A rough-hewn tunnel twists north from the opening.
^3b6

Two earth elementals created by Nafik dug this tunnel under his instructions. They eventually hollowed out a cavern to safeguard the high priest's heart (see area P64).

#### P63: Burial Chamber

Six open sarcophagi rest in this octagonal room. This room was supposed to be the burial place of [Nafik](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafik-qftis.md) and the other priests of Amun Sa, but Nafik transformed them all into Undead with his foul ritual. The sarcophagi are empty.

#### P64: Heart's Lair

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The walls of this cavern are rough and irregular. Jumbled blocks of stone are strewn about the floor. Two large creatures made of solid earth stand imposingly before an alcove in the cavern's northeast corner.
^3b9

Nafik keeps his heart in a glass bell jar in the cavern's northeast cave. It's guarded by two [earth elementals](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md). The elementals stand in stony silence unless intruders approach the northeastern alcove, at which point they attack.

##### Nafik's Heart

The heart's glass jar is sealed to the floor in the northeast cave and can be smashed easily. The heart inside looks like an ordinary human heart, beating steadily. Nafik's heart has Armor Class 5 and 5 hit points. If the heart is destroyed, Nafik's Rejuvenation trait ceases to function.

### Tomb of Amun Sa

The following locations are keyed to map 5.5.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 5.5: Tomb of Amun Sa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/092-map-5.08-tomb-of-amun-sa-map.webp#gallery)

#### P65: The Pharaoh's True Way

The characters can enter this room only after completing the Trial of Truth (see area P57). When they arrive, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The water lifts you up the shaft into the south end of this corridor and splashes around exuberantly. This corridor ends in a set of elegant bronze double doors.
^3bd

After 10 minutes, the water returns to its normal downward flow. The water enters the shaft from a hole just below the floor of the corridor.

##### Water of Athis

The water in this room is the water of Athis (see the "Pyramid Features" section).

#### P66: Treasury of the Pharaohs

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A reed boat spans the length of the western wall of this stone treasury. Several jars rest inside the boat, whose bow features an empty, fist-sized indent.
> 
> A mural on the east wall depicts the boat sailing on the clouds with a glittering gemstone in its bow.
^3c0

The containers in the boat are canopic jars.

##### Magic Mural

This magic mural is a portal. A character who inspects the mural and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can tell that the mural is magical, and a [Detect Magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around it.

Passing through the mural teleports a creature to area P67, thousands of feet above the pyramid. A character who touches the painting finds that their hand passes right through it, and they feel cold air on the other side. A character who sticks their head through it finds themself looking out over the desert landscape, as if through a window in the sky.

#### P67: Floating Boat

When the characters first look through the mural in area P66, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You peer from a hazy portal high above the desert. Thousands of feet in the sky, the air is thin and cold. Just beneath the portal floats a layer of sparse clouds, and the pyramid is but a tiny speck directly below you.
> 
> An exact copy of the boat from the treasury floats thirty feet from you, perfectly still. The large gemstone from the painting is set in its bow, and ten ornate vases rest within it.
^3c3

This portal and floating boat are located 10,000 feet in the air, directly above the pyramid. The floating boat is 30 feet from the portal. The boat is fixed to its position; no amount of force can move it.

The gemstone in the boat's bow is the star-gem of Mo-Pelar, one of the two treasures the characters require to fulfill Amun Sa's quest. It can be removed from its niche on the floating boat with a gentle twist. Characters might retrieve the gem by one of the following means:

- Flying or teleporting to the boat  
- Grabbing the gem with a spell such as [Mage Hand](Mechanics/spells/mage-hand.md)  
- Lassoing the boat with a rope and shimmying across with a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check  

##### Falling

A creature that falls from the boat or the portal plummets 10,000 feet to the ground; it takes 70 (`20d6`) bludgeoning damage and has the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition at the base of the pyramid.

##### Treasure

The star-gem of Mo-Pelar lodged into the floating boat is a [Gem of Seeing](Mechanics/items/gem-of-seeing.md). The ten ornate vases in the boat each contain 200 pp (for a total of 2,000 pp). Each vase weighs 15 pounds.

#### P68: The Pharaoh's Tomb

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A grand sarcophagus lies in the center of this room, with a golden staff set across it. In the center of the north wall stands a statue of Amun Sa with a stone replica of a gem held its outstretched right hand and a stone replica of the staff held across its body with its left hand. Hieroglyphs adorn the walls.
^3c7

This is the true tomb of Amun Sa. Inside the ornate sarcophagus lies the pharaoh's mummified body, dressed in time-worn ceremonial clothing.

##### Hieroglyphs

If translated (see the "Pyramid Features" section), the hieroglyphs read as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "A passage is always provided between the tomb of the king and his likeness, whereby his spirit may pass into his ordained statue and live within the stone we worship in the outer world."
^3c9

##### Treasure

The staff lying atop the sarcophagus is the [Staff of Ruling](Mechanics/items/staff-of-ruling-qftis.md), one of the two treasures needed to fulfill the pharaoh's quest.

##### One-Way Teleport

After retrieving both of the pharaoh's implements, the characters are teleported to area P2. If the characters are on good terms with the Tears of Athis, Iaseda commends them on their successful quest. The Tears of Athis then rush from the pyramid to see if the curse has been lifted.

## Conclusion

If the characters leave the tomb with both the [Staff of Ruling](Mechanics/items/staff-of-ruling-qftis.md) and the star-gem of Mo-Pelar, read or paraphrase the following text:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Silence hangs heavy in the still, dry air. Time seems to have stopped, holding all the world in the balance. The pharaoh's ghostly figure hovers on the horizon.
> 
> Distant thunder rolls gently across the far-flung sands. The horizon blurs as a whirlwind begins to spin around the massive pyramid. Swirling wind and sand sing past you, a chorus of a thousand voices: the hopes and cries of a land long dead, and the name of its long-accursed pharaoh—Amun Sa. You hear his earnest voice echo in your mind amid the jarring crescendo, saying:
> 
> "You have done what others could not; you have put my soul and the souls of my people to rest. The curse upon this land is ended. Keep my staff, my star-gem, and all the treasure you have found within my tomb—and know that you will forever have my gratitude."
> 
> The sandstorm settles, and all is still once more. The pharaoh's ghost is gone. From below, you hear the cool sound of running water. As the dusty air clears, it reveals a large basin now overflowing with spring-clear water that surges along a channel toward the horizon. It will take time to heal this land, but there will be blossoms in the spring, for the river has returned from its exile—and with it comes life.

The characters have also earned the gratitude of Iaseda and the Tears of Athis. As a reward for completing Amun Sa's quest, the characters may keep any magic items or treasure they recovered from the pyramid, though the Tears of Athis ask the characters to leave any items of cultural, historical, or religious significance inside the pyramid.

In the months that follow, the Tears of Athis spread word of party's deeds and work to build a thriving society in the region so the descendants of Bakar may return and flourish alongside the river's restorative waters again.
