# Chapter 4: Beyond the Crystal Cave
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase* 

![Caerwyn and Porphura, two ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/054-04-001.ch4-beyond-the-crystal-cave.webp#center "Caerwyn and Porphura, two powerful spellcasters in love, relax in the fairytale garden they created together")

The city of Sybar on the small island of Sybarate serves as a hub for fishing and trade. Its people are industrious and friendly, and they eagerly share stories with visitors. One popular tale surrounds the Eternal Garden, a magical paradise created by two lovers ages ago. Legend states the entrance to the garden lies deep within a crystal cave that whispers secrets of the future to those brave or foolish enough to enter. More recently, two young paramours—one of whom is the daughter of the island's governor—fled their feuding families in search of the fabled utopia.

![A Door to the Eternal Garden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/055-04-002.eternal-garden-door.webp#center)

The Eternal Garden is real. Past the dangers of the cave, the garden is tucked away in the Feywild, far from the pressures of the world. Whimsical Fey, talking animals, and a benevolent archfey ruler await visitors to the garden. So does the Fountain All Heal, a miraculous fountain whose waters cure most ailments but also enchant those who drink from it, lulling imbibers into a comfort that makes them never want to leave. None of the garden's denizens are inherently malicious, but they defend their own. Wits, clever words, and compassion are more effective weapons here than swords or spells.

The paramours' families, once long-standing rivals, have put aside their enmity in hopes that when the missing lovers are found, they will then be willing to come home. It's been two years since the couple's disappearance, but neither family has abandoned hope. The families turn to adventurers to rescue their missing loved ones.

"Beyond the Crystal Cave" is designed for four to six 6th-level characters.

## Background

Long ago, an elf archdruid named Caerwyn retired to Sybarate with her soulmate, a human archmage named Porphura. There on Caerwyn's estates, they laid out and built a sprawling garden. It was an earthly paradise, serving both as a symbol of their enduring love and an idyllic retreat.

Caerwyn and Porphura stocked their garden with the loveliest of plants and encouraged gentle forest creatures to make it their home. Porphura used magic to extend her life so she could remain with Caerwyn throughout the elf's longer life span.

To protect their paradise, the lovers struck a bargain with an old friend, an archfey known as the Gardener. Together the three of them drew the garden into the Feywild, where the Gardener became its caretaker. The domain maintained a connection to the Material Plane through a fey crossing in a magical cave on Sybarate, the Cave of Echoes.

When Caerwyn's life reached its inevitable end, Porphura worked one last undertaking. She raised a tomb inside their home and sealed off the palace from the rest of the garden, so the pair could rest undisturbed together forever. Porphura then laid down beside Caerwyn for the last time and let the magic that sustained her own life finally unravel.

### Using the Infinite Staircase

If you're using [Nafas](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md) as a patron, he summons the characters to the Censer of Dreams (detailed in chapter 1), where he recounts the following wish:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Two families, their histories and hands stained with hate and blood, now raise their voices as one in the wake of true love lost. Heed their plea and carry their wandering hearts home."
^226

Nafas then teleports the characters to a door that leads to Sybar. After the adventure, the characters can return to the staircase through the same portal.

### Adventure Hooks

If you're not using Nafas as a group patron, consider the following ways to involve the characters in the adventure:

- **From the Sea.** The characters arrive on a ship or wash ashore from a shipwreck. They learn the governor of Sybar is seeking adventurers to rescue her missing daughter.  
- **Missing Friends.** One or more characters are old friends of one or both of the missing lovers, Juliana and Orlando. The governor sends for the characters, desperate for their help after a string of failed rescue attempts.  

### Setting the Adventure

On the world of Oerth in the Greyhawk campaign setting, the island of Sybarate is located in the mouth of Jeklea Bay, about a mile south of Fairwind Isle.

If you'd like to place the adventure in another campaign setting, consider the following suggestions:

- **Dragonlance.** On the world of Krynn, Juliana and Orlando might be from rival kingdoms that don't typically get along, such as Qualinesti and Silvanesti. Amid the smoldering ashes of war, the story of the missing lovers can remind the heroes what they fight for and warn of the divisions that weaken the free peoples of Ansalon.  
- **Eberron.** The cave is a manifest zone of Thelanis, the Faerie Court, and the Eternal Garden resides on that plane. Juliana and Orlando are scions of rival Dragonmarked houses, fleeing prohibition against their relationship.  
- **Theros.** The Cave of Echoes is sacred to Karametra, a god of harvests who shepherds the mortal need for love, security, and belonging. She cradles the Eternal Garden in the godly realm of Nyx, and the native creatures that dwell there are Nyxborn.  

## Adventure Summary

"Beyond the Crystal Cave" begins when characters approach the governor of Sybarate, who is offering a small fortune for an urgent rescue mission. The characters learn the tale of Caerwyn and Porphura's garden, where two new lovers, Juliana and Orlando, have fled to escape their feuding families. Only one path leads into the hidden refuge: a cave with a mystical reputation. After besting the cave's guardians, the characters find a waterfall frozen in time and unravel its mysteries to discover a fey crossing into the Eternal Garden in the Feywild.

As the characters explore the garden, they likely meet the Gardener, the archfey who rules the domain; this is especially likely if they clash with any denizens of the garden, which abounds with eccentric Fey creatures. Various beings can offer cryptic clues to the missing lovers' whereabouts in a hidden palace within the garden. While in the garden, the characters might learn of a fountain that cures almost any ailment but enchants those who drink it to want to remain in the garden forever.

The adventure concludes when the characters free Juliana and Orlando from the fountain's enchantment and convince them that their families are no longer enemies. When they all arrive back on the Material Plane, they might discover they've been gone longer than they realized, thanks to the divergent flow of time within the garden.

### Character Advancement

If you want to use story-based level advancement, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters.

When the characters leave the garden, with or without Juliana and Orlando, everyone in the party gains 1 level. If you follow this method, the characters should reach 7th level by the adventure's conclusion.

> [!readaloud] About the Original
> 
> Published in 1983, *Beyond the Crystal Cave* is the first adventure in the series of adventures produced by TSR UK. The story draws inspiration from the star-crossed lovers in Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*. It was a departure from the more expected adventure design of the time in that violent solutions to problems aren't an automatic path to victory—inquisitive minds and compassionate hearts carry the heroes further than strength of arms.
> 
> This updated version of the adventure reimagines Caerwyn and Porphura's—originally Porpherio's—garden as the Eternal Garden, a domain in the Feywild, and the Green Man as the Gardener, the benevolent archfey who rules it.

## Sybar

![Governor Isabela Folcarae](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/057-04-004.governor-isabela-folcarae.webp#center)

A small fishing and port city, Sybar is the capital of Sybarate and the island's center of administration and trade. The governor's mansion and various executive offices are situated here, along with a temple to the sea god Procan.

Sybar is situated on the north coast of the island. Fishing and farming villages dot the remainder of Sybarate, which is lush with vineyards; vegetable farms; and extensive olive, lemon, and orange orchards. The people of the island are orderly and law abiding, but many of the old families hold longstanding grudges against one another.

Merchants and artisans are plentiful in Sybar, as are sailors and traders in the port. The locals tend to be talkative over meals, stiff drinks, or hot beverages on chilly evenings. If the characters mingle with the people of Sybar, residents can relate the story of the Eternal Garden (as presented in this adventure's background) or any of the rumors in the Sybar Rumors table, only some of which are true.

**Sybar Rumors**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-beyond-the-crystal-cave.md#^sybar-rumors)`

^sybar-rumors

### Meeting the Governor

Governor Isabela Folcarae (lawful good, human [bandit captain](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)) receives the characters shortly after they call at her mansion. Read or paraphrase the following text to begin the adventure:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> You stand in a tastefully appointed study with nautical decor. The governor, an human woman with iron-gray hair, stares pensively into the fireplace. After a polite offer of refreshment, she gets down to business.
> 
> She speaks in a solemn voice. "My daughter Juliana, and Orlando, son of the prominent Monego family, have been missing for two years, but we have never given up hope that they still live. After several failed expeditions and countless nights of worry, I believe I finally know where they've gone. If you bring them home safely, I will reward you handsomely."
^22e

The governor can offer the following information:

- Juliana and Orlando eloped when their feuding families forbade their relationship.  
- The couple fled south and disappeared into the Cave of Echoes, a cavern steeped in local legends of oracular voices and granted wishes.  
- In their shared grief, the families have settled their differences and resolved to do all in their power to rescue the missing couple.  
- The families have sent numerous adventurers in search of the couple; the few that returned did so empty-handed.  

Governor Folcarae can also relate the legend of the Eternal Garden, but she doesn't know details about its inhabitants or dangers—she doubts it even exists. In exchange for Juliana and Orlando's safe return, she promises a reward of 5,000 gp.

## Cave of Echoes

The Cave of Echoes is a day's ride south of Sybar. Originally, the cave was the underground course of a river that flowed from a lake in the Eternal Garden before the garden was drawn into the Feywild. The caverns were worn smooth by the water that once rushed through them.

The cave entrance yawns in the southwest side of the small hill where the garden once stood. A fey crossing in the Cave of Echoes links it to the Eternal Garden and saturates the caverns with fey magic. The hilltop is now barren, and the river, which still flows through the portal, has been reduced to a mere trickle. The meager stream ends at a muddy chamber in the cave, depositing what little magic it still contains there.

Locals know of the Cave of Echoes, and many believe a specific chamber has oracular powers. Most Sybarate citizens either have sought answers from the cavern or know someone who did. The magic of the Feywild whispers into the cavern, offering aid to those of good heart and true need, as it did with Juliana and Orlando when it whisked them away to the garden. Few venture beyond this chamber, wary of dangers that lurk deeper within the cave.

### Cave of Echoes Features

Unless otherwise noted, the Cave of Echoes has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings in chambers are 20 feet high and bristle with stalactites.  
- **Echoes.** Sounds echo strangely throughout the cave, distorting into fleeting whispers.  
- **Lighting.** The cave isn't illuminated. The current occupants rely on [darkvision](Mechanics/Rules/senses.md#Darkvision) to see. Area descriptions assume the characters have a light source or other means of seeing in the dark.  
- **Tunnels.** The tunnels connecting caverns are roughly round and 10 feet in diameter.  

### Cave of Echoes Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.1.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.1: Cave of Echoes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/058-map-4.01-cave-of-echoes.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/059-map-4.01-cave-of-echoes-player.webp#gallery)

#### C1: Empty Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This vaulted cavern is forty feet across and twenty-five feet high in the center. The ground is flat and scuffed with muddy tracks, and the walls are marked with initials and names carved into the stone. Tunnels lead deeper into darkness to the east and the south.
^233

The entrance cavern is empty save for the tracks of Humanoid entrants, most of whom stopped here before turning back. A few follow the tunnel to the south.

##### Writing on the Walls

Names and initials are inscribed on the walls. Some are the results of dares or tests of bravery; others were left by those marking their visit to the Cavern of Echoes (area C2). Older markings left in ink, charcoal, or paint are faded and illegible. A character who leaves their name or initials in the cave sometimes hears their name whispered among the echoes of the cave.

Characters who examine the walls find the initials "C + P" carved into the stone and circumscribed by a heart. A character who studies the wall and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check determines these initials weren't carved by tools, but rather were magically engraved into the stone. Caerwyn and Porphura marked the wall using the [Stone Shape](Mechanics/spells/stone-shape.md) spell.

#### C2: Cavern of Echoes

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Even the smallest sounds echo in this round, forty-foot-wide chamber. The walls and floor are glassy smooth and black, refracting light into rainbows beneath the stone. The ceiling vanishes into darkness high overhead. In the center of the floor, inlaid with white marble, is the word "Ask" in Common.
^236

The ceiling in this oracular chamber is 80 feet high and smooth like the walls and floor.

##### Loud Echoes

Sounds in this area echo loudly. Noises louder than a typical conversation—such as shouting or playing an instrument—reverberate painfully. If this occurs, each creature in the chamber must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (`3d8`) thunder damage and have the [deafened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Deafened) condition for 1 minute. The echo then dissipates and doesn't compound.

##### Whispers of Fate

The magic of the Feywild whispers into the cavern, offering aid to those in true need and without selfish intent. When such a creature requests help in this area, the cavern can offer answers or intervene by duplicating any spell of 8th level or lower (your choice, not the creature's). The most common assistance provided by the cave comes in the form of the [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md), [Heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md), and [Plane Shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md) (to the Eternal Garden only) spells; when duplicating the effect of a spell, the cavern targets the creature that requested its aid.

A creature that asks a question here receives a truthful, albeit cryptic, answer in Common with clues to its goals. Those who can help themselves, such as the characters, receive only this benefit from the cavern. If the characters inquire about the whereabouts of Juliana and Orlando, disembodied voices tell them their quarry is just beyond the crystal cave (area C6). The cave's oracular power is similar to a [Divination](Mechanics/spells/divination.md) spell.

A creature that makes a selfish or destructive request causes thunderous reprimands to reverberate through the chamber, triggering the effects of loud echoes (see the "Loud Echoes" section). Once a creature asks a question here and receives a benefit, no matter how small, the creature can't do so again for 1 year and 1 day.

#### C3: Haunted Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this cavern is ridged like sand at the bottom of a stream. It's dotted with slender stalagmites and littered with broken stalactites from the ceiling thirty feet above. The main tunnel continues to the east, and smaller side chambers extend to the north and the south.
^23a

Three [poltergeists](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/poltergeist.md) (variant [specters](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/specter.md)) haunt the main chamber of the cavern, venting their fury on intruders. The restless spirits hurl broken stalactites at unsuspecting entrants or toss creatures onto pointed stalagmites in the cavern.

A cavity to the north collects moisture dripping from the ceiling. An [ochre jelly](Mechanics/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) lurks here, content to feed on fungus and the remains of the poltergeists' occasional victims. It slithers into the main cavern if battle breaks out.

##### Stalagmites

The rock formations throughout this cavern are dangerously sharp. A creature pushed into a stalagmite takes 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage.

##### Treasure

The skeleton of a decades-dead human knight rests in the south chamber, impaled on a stalagmite by the poltergeists. Most equipment the knight once carried has rusted or rotted away, but a [Necklace of Adaptation](Mechanics/items/necklace-of-adaptation.md) hangs around the dead warrior's neck. Scattered on the floor beneath the skeleton are 8 pp, 22 gp, and a yellow topaz (250 gp).

#### C4: Living Mud Cavern

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This cavern is large and irregular in shape. The bare rock floor forms a shallow depression that contains a mud pool fed by a sluggish stream flowing from the southeast. Near the west side of the pool are two mounds of dried mud.
^23e

The stream flowing from area C6 ends here in a 1-foot-deep mud pool. The mud is "difficult terrain".

The magic-infused water bestowed animate life on the mud, creating two mud elementals that lurk in the pool. A character who surveys the pool and succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the mud elementals.

Each mud elemental uses the [water elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) stat block with the following changes:

- It has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to [hide](Mechanics/Rules/actions.md#Hide) in mud.  
- Its speed isn't reduced in "difficult terrain" composed of earth or mud.  

The elementals attack any creatures that approach the mud or the mounds of dried mud, but they don't pursue creatures out of the area and sink back into the mud if foes flee.

##### Treasure

The mounds encase the desiccated remains of two adventures slain by the mud elementals. The adventurers were sent by the governor to find Juliana and Orlando but never returned. Once the elementals are dead, weapons or tools can easily break away the mud shells covering the remains.

One mound entombs the remains of a human warrior. His [chain mail](Mechanics/items/chain-mail.md), [shield](Mechanics/items/shield.md), and [longsword](Mechanics/items/longsword.md) are rusted but still functional, and he has 20 gp in a crumbled purse.

The other mound holds the remains of an elf thief with a set of [thieves' tools](Mechanics/items/thieves-tools.md), 50 gp, and 50 pp. Her shriveled hand clutches a [+1 Dagger](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md) with the name "Madrigal" carved into its ivory handle in Elvish.

#### C5: Stream Tunnel

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A narrow stream runs along the bottom of this winding tunnel. The echoes of the stream's soft babbling are unusually loud.
> 
> Partway along the stream's path, the waterway widens to a ten-foot-wide pool before it narrows again and continues.
^241

The stream flows from the waterfall in area C6 to the mud pool in area C4.

##### Treasure

The pool is 3 feet deep, with a bottom of smooth rocks and pebbles that have washed down the stream. A character who searches the pool and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check realizes that seven of the smooth rocks are uncut gemstones: two garnets (10 gp each), two blue tourmalines (15 gp each), an amber (20 gp), a moonstone (25 gp), and a cloudy diamond (50 gp). A character who spends 10 minutes sifting through the river bottom succeeds on the check automatically.

A character who has proficiency with jeweler's tools can cut the gems with two days of work per gem. Doing so multiplies each gem's value by ten.

#### C6: Crystal Cave

![A waterfall in a crystal c...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/060-04-005.crystal-cave-waterfall.webp#center "A waterfall in a crystal cave hides a fey crossing to the Eternal Garden")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The echoes of the stream fade, replaced by an ethereal melody that tugs at your heartstrings. Massive formations of quartz crystals cover the walls and ceiling of this chamber.
> 
> A motionless waterfall pours from a crack near the ceiling of the east wall—a time-frozen curtain of water and hanging droplets. It collects into a wide, similarly static pool below. Farther from the water's source, the pool slowly begins to ripple, then drains into the stream that flows out the tunnel.
^244

This crystal chamber is tethered to the Eternal Garden and by extension the Feywild. The waterfall isn't truly unmoving, but it pours so slowly it appears that way to casual observation. It takes 20 minutes for a droplet to fall from the ceiling into the pool.

##### Crystals

Any bright light in the room refracts through the crystals and fills the chamber with a soft glow and dazzling rainbow patterns.

##### Music

The disembodied melody carries the emotional resonance of the Feywild and evokes nostalgia in those who hear it. Characters who listen to the music can feel it tugging at memories from their pasts, whether joyful or otherwise.

The music causes momentary ripples in the seemingly frozen waterfall. A character who studies the waterfall and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check notices the ripples and their connection to the music.

##### Pool

The pool is 5 feet deep. At the end the waterfall pours into, it too appears frozen in time, while at the far end, the water perceptibly flows into the stream. Within 10 feet of the waterfall, the pool is solid enough to walk on, though anything stationary on the water's surface slowly sinks to the bottom over the course of 1 minute.

##### Waterfall

The waterfall blocks passage to the fey crossing in area C7. Like the pool, the waterfall is nearly solid, and it blocks the tunnel except for a 1-inch gap on either side. The waterfall is 5 feet thick. A creature that looks through it with a light source can make out a passage hidden behind the falls.

Traversing the waterfall is difficult but can be accomplished through the following means:

- **Brute Force.** As an action, a character can force their way through the falls with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A character who fails the check still manages to push through but gains 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) from the exertion.  
- **Song.** A character can create a temporary passage through the water by humming, singing, or playing a song. As an action, a character who performs a song and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Performance](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Performance)) check creates a 5-foot-wide opening in the waterfall for 1 minute.  
- **Spells.** Magic offers the following solutions:  

- [Control Water](Mechanics/spells/control-water.md) parts or raises the waterfall for the spell's duration.  
- [Create or Destroy Water](Mechanics/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md) cast to destroy part of the waterfall destroys a 5-foot-cube of water, which fills in after 1 minute.  
- Teleportation bypasses the waterfall as normal.  
- A creature under the effect of a [Slow](Mechanics/spells/slow.md) spell more closely matches the waterfall's altered time and can move through the waterfall as if it were "difficult terrain".  
- A successful [Dispel Magic](Mechanics/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell (DC 15) cast on the waterfall causes it to flow normally for 1 minute, during which time creatures can move through the water as if it were difficult terrain.  

At the DM's discretion, other solutions to bypassing the waterfall might exist.

#### C7: Observation Parlor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Behind the waterfall is a room carved into the rock. Two steps ascend to a mosaic floor depicting birds, flowers, and fruit, which is littered with the long-collapsed remains of furniture and shards of broken glass.
> 
> A decorated alcove stands in the far wall opposite the entrance.
^24a

This was once a lounge Caerwyn and Porphura used to relax and enjoy the view of the crystal cave through the waterfall.

##### Alcove

This alcove is a fey crossing, a place of beauty where the Material Plane and the Feywild converge. Its walls are carved with a triptych woodland scene depicting forest animals and reveling satyrs, pixies, and sprites. The alcove radiates an aura of conjuration magic if observed with a [Detect Magic](Mechanics/spells/detect-magic.md) spell, and any creature that moves into it vanishes, transported to area G1 of the Eternal Garden (detailed later in this adventure).

## Eternal Garden

Since being drawn into the Feywild, the Eternal Garden has become a Domain of Delight: a realm subject to the whims of the archfey who rules it. The overall composition and layout of the garden remain consistent from its days in the Material Plane, but Feywild magic has suffused it with a vibrancy beyond reality. Colors are more saturated, sounds are almost musical, and sensations pluck at a visitor's emotions, like the scent of a beloved childhood meal or the melody of a cherished tune.

Caerwyn and Porphura's magnificent home, the Palace of Spires, disappeared from the garden long ago. In the place where it once stood now looms an ever-changing hedge maze. Leaves growing throughout the garden act as keys to a magic sundial at the heart of the maze that transports those who solve it to the hidden palace.

### Garden Denizens

Fey creatures, awakened animals and plants, and wanderers both Humanoid and otherwise call the garden home. Some of its long-standing residents were once visitors from faraway places who elected to stay in the garden, which transformed them into Fey over time. These sapient beings tend to form communities, though some prefer solitude, and they all are free to wander the garden as whim or errand dictates. The residents' demesnes are indicated on map 4.2.

#### Awakened Animals

Feywild magic has bestowed sapience on some of the Beasts that dwell within the Eternal Garden. Awakened animals in the garden speak Common and Sylvan.

#### The Gardener

The archfey who governs the Eternal Garden is known simply as [the Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md). The Gardener was a lifelong friend of Caerwyn and Porphura and gladly bound themself to the garden. Now, the Gardener lovingly tends the garden as much because it is their own home as to honor their dear friends' memories. The Gardener doesn't tolerate any attempt to damage or significantly alter the garden, nor do they accept the killing of any of its residents. Digging a hole, breaking branches, or foraging for food is fine. More intrusive or violent actions such as damming a river, clear-cutting a forest, or slaughtering pixies draw the Gardener's ire.

The Gardener demands an explanation for transgressions worthy of their attention, and if the characters aren't contrite, the Gardener attacks to knock them [unconscious](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and leaves them at the mercy of the leprechauns' mischief (see area G1). This is a one-time chance for the characters to amend their behavior. If the characters continue to be a problem, the Gardener forcibly ejects them from the garden, teleporting the characters to the mouth of the Cave of Echoes. If the characters later return to the garden, its residents advise them to tread lightly.

### Love in the Garden

Juliana and Orlando have spent two days in the Eternal Garden—equal to two years on the Material Plane—wandering the garden's meadows in awed delight, thrilled and relieved to have found a sanctuary where they can live and love each other in peace. The garden's Fey and awakened residents feel a glimmer of their lost friends Caerwyn and Porphura in the young couple; many denizens are convinced Juliana and Orlando are the garden's creators reincarnated. As such, they're fiercely protective of the couple and become hostile toward intruders who threaten the lovers.

### Random Encounters

You can breathe life into the garden by introducing random encounters as the characters explore the realm. A random encounter occurs whenever you want one to, such as while the characters are traveling between locations. To determine what they find, roll on the Eternal Garden Encounters table. If you don't like the result, choose a different encounter you think would be fun.

**Eternal Garden Encounters**

`dice: [](05-chapter-4-beyond-the-crystal-cave.md#^eternal-garden-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |

| 2 | Two [leprechauns](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/leprechaun-qftis.md) repair a large pile of worn-out shoes and boots. If the characters help, the leprechauns might give the characters a hint to one of their limerick riddles (see area G1). |

### Eternal Garden Features

The Eternal Garden has the following features:

- **Boundary.** At the border of the domain is a lightly obscuring mist, tinged with a sweet blossom scent and the colors of sunset. No matter how far a creature travels into the mist, the creature finds itself back where it entered the border, returning to the garden.  
- **Eternal Summer.** The climate in the garden is a perpetual, lovely summer, but weather conditions reflect the emotional tone of creatures in the garden. In times of danger, thunderstorms shake the sky. During times of melancholy or mourning, chill rain patters throughout the domain.  
- **Gardener's Vigil.** The Gardener senses when anything dies in the garden. If a creature dies in the garden, roll a `d6`. On a 1, the Gardener appears on initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties) to investigate.  
- **Lighting.** The sky above the garden is a perpetual twilight range of orange, red, pink, and yellow hues with no visible sun, moon, or stars. During daylight hours, it emits bright light, but at night, it never reaches full darkness, becoming dim light instead.  
- **Memory Loss.** Unless otherwise stated, a creature that leaves the domain must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; Fey creatures and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature remembers nothing of its time in the garden or the Palace of Spires. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact, but they're hazy and dreamlike. A [Remove Curse](Mechanics/spells/remove-curse.md) or [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell restores the creature's memories.  
- **Time.** Time passes slower in the Eternal Garden relative to other planes. For each day spent in the garden, one year passes on the Material Plane.  

### Eternal Garden Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.2.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.2: Eternal Garden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/061-map-4.02-eternal-garden.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/062-map-4.02-eternal-garden-player.webp#gallery)

#### G1: Fairy Ring

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ring of toadstools twenty feet across stands in the center of a forest clearing. Bright green grass and colorful wildflowers blanket the ground. The toadstools range from the size of a finger to as large as a chair.
> 
> Five figures sit on the largest toadstools. All are diminutive, jovial creatures—no more than three feet tall—wearing dapper, red clothing with gleaming buttons and buckles. Each wears a different style hat and regards you with delighted anticipation.
^255

When the characters pass through the fey crossing in the Cave of Echoes (see area C7), they vanish and reappear in the center of this fairy ring. The characters all appear at the same time, even if they entered the alcove at different times.

##### Leprechauns

The five creatures are [leprechauns](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/leprechaun-qftis.md) named Brunnick, Cellia, Flenas, Layleen, and Nerwyn. They are mischievous but fun loving, and all are genuinely delighted to see new visitors—mostly because they have new people to tease, as the rest of the garden's inhabitants have long grown weary of their antics.

##### Toadstools

The toadstools form a fairy ring that acts as a permanent teleportation circle, which can serve as the destination of teleportation magic and spells such as [Plane Shift](Mechanics/spells/plane-shift.md). Though the fairy ring once provided an exit from the garden, the fey crossing is now one-way, allowing exit only with a special key (see the "Returning to the Garden" section of this adventure's conclusion for more on exiting through the fairy ring).

##### What the Leprechauns Know

The leprechauns greet newcomers happily, responding to questions about themselves, the garden, and Juliana and Orlando with one or more of the cryptic rhymes shown in the Limericks table.

If the characters ply the leprechauns with amusements (leveraging the leprechaun's Reluctant Refusal trait), the [charmed](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Charmed) leprechauns let slip some hints to their riddles or their belief that the young lovers are the incarnations of the garden denizens' beloved friends, Caerwyn and Porphura.

If the leprechauns are attacked, they confuse foes with illusions or turn [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and flee. They take care to return later to plague the characters with irksome pranks such as the following:

- Steal a weapon or magic item  
- Steal a component pouch or spellcasting focus  
- Fill armor, clothes, or packs with itching powder  

![A boisterous gaggle of lep...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/063-04-006.leprechauns.webp#center "A boisterous gaggle of leprechauns greets entrants to the Eternal Garden with japery and merriment")

**Limericks**

| Limerick | Describes |
|----------|-----------|
| The river o'er yonder appearing, Has five bridges of which you're hearing. The problem we set, Is how do you get, Across each and return to this clearing? | Endless River (area G4) |
| A fountain rests here in the garden, Whose waters, we hear, like to harden. But a drink now and then, Cures all in our ken, And may even bring cries of "Pardon!" | Fountain All Heal (area G9) |
| There's a lovely building just here, With turrets and domes far and near. 'Tis a shame you can't spy it, As we urge you to try it. Solve the puzzle and see it appear! | Palace of Spires (detailed later in this adventure) |
| Some may think our maze is a pest, But it shelters a haven of rest. And ere anyone leaves, They must leave more than leaves, And then honor our master's request. | Hedge Maze (area G21) and Palace of Spires (detailed later in this adventure) |
| There are leaves in the garden to trace, And a maze with a clear central space. With a leaf in your hand, You could stand and stand, But to leave, leave the leaves in place. | Hedge Maze (area G21) |
| There once was a young man from Sybar, Who was stung on the nose by a wasp. We said, "Does it hurt?" He replied, "Not at all, It can do it again if it likes." | Nonsense, but it sends the leprechauns into gales of laughter and knowing winks |
^limericks

#### G2: Leprechaun Woods

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This lush forest brims with game and edible plants. A massive oak tree, the only oak in this region, looms above the rest of the forest. Among the undergrowth, shamrock plants thrive.
^25a

The leprechauns in area G1 often roam this forest. They hide here after pulling pranks on the garden's denizens.

##### Key Leaves

The shamrock leaves that grow in this area function as a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

#### G3: Great Oak Tree

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A tremendous oak tree stretches hundreds of feet into the air, rising high above the surrounding canopy. Easily fifty feet wide at the base, its trunk is gnarled, covered with creeping greenery, and surrounded by flowering shamrocks.
^25d

Several leprechauns live inside this great oak. The interior is sized for Small creatures and is brightly lit by cage lanterns full of fireflies. At any given time, `1d4` friendly [leprechauns](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/leprechaun-qftis.md) are here, enjoying the comforts of their home.

##### Hidden Home

An illusion hides the front door to the tree house at ground level. A character who studies the tree trunk and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check discerns the illusion for what it is.

The first floor of the tree home is a circular kitchen with wooden furnishings and simple flatware for five. It's stocked with nutritious food, water, and wine. A spiral staircase carved into the interior wall of the trunk rises to a bedroom with five crisply made beds arranged radially around the wall. A chest at the foot of each bed holds fashionable clothing—most of it red—and blankets.

##### Kitchen Pit

Beneath the kitchen table is a secret trapdoor. A character who searches the kitchen and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discovers the door. It leads to a tunnel that ends in a cave-in with several crushed humanoid skeletons visible at its edge, but this is an illusion concealing a 6-foot-deep pit. A character who searches the tunnel and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, or who tries to interact with the illusion physically, discerns the illusion for what it is.

##### Key Leaves

The shamrock and oak leaves that grow in this area function as keys to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

##### Treasure

A character who digs at the bottom of the kitchen pit discovers a pouch with an [Ioun Stone (sustenance)](Mechanics/items/ioun-stone-sustenance.md) and two dull-gray stones that lost their magic long ago. Digging deeper reveals a copper crock filled with 2,500 gp—the leprechauns' collected gold. If the gold is stolen, the leprechauns stop at nothing to retrieve it.

#### G4: Endless River

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This babbling river flows through the garden, sometimes defying logic. Here and there, its waters seemingly course in different directions, and it teems with colorful fish and other freshwater fauna.
^263

![Vuuthramis, a timid bronze...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/064-04-007.vuuthramis.webp#center "Vuuthramis, a timid bronze dragon, gambols in the river when no one is watching")

The river is home to Vuuthramis, a shy but playful [young bronze dragon](Mechanics/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md). She lives in a cave hidden beneath the river. Vuuthramis drank from the Fountain All Heal (area G9) and succumbed to its enchantment. As a result, she has no desire to keep a treasure hoard. She's content to swim and frolic in the river, occasionally venturing onto its banks.

Vuuthramis cautiously observes characters near the riverbank. Characters who survey the river or enter its waters and succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spot the dragon, who keeps her distance. If a character reacts peacefully and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, Vuuthramis overcomes her reticence. Otherwise, she darts away, only to return later.

##### Capricious River

The river ranges from 10 to 20 feet in depth and 10 to 50 feet in width. Its flow is unpredictable, reversing at various points along its ovular length. Roll a die for any 100-foot stretch of river. On an even number, it flows clockwise; on an odd number, it flows counterclockwise.

##### What Vuuthramis Knows

Vuuthramis watches and listens along the course of the river and knows the surrounding inhabitants. If a character overcomes the dragon's shyness, she tells the characters about a few of the garden's denizens, such as Gnarlroot, the [treant](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/treant.md) in area G12, who "seems extra grumpy today."

In addition to this general knowledge, Vuuthramis witnessed Juliana and Orlando stop to picnic with a group of pixies and sprites from the fairy forest (area G10) on the riverbank two days earlier, before the pair continued west.

#### G5: Dryads' Woods

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This forest is dense and difficult to travel, with only a few worn footpaths connecting its small clearings. Most of the trees here are old, mighty oaks.
^267

Two [dryads](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/dryad.md), Sonna and Yvra, tend to this stretch of woods. Sonna and Yvra were once knights in service to rival Fey courts who fell in love. As punishment for defying their rulers to pursue a relationship, they were bound to oak trees and separated. [The Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) heard their lamentations, and when Caerwyn and Porphura approached the archfey to take charge of the domain, the Gardener stole Sonna and Yvra's trees from their jailers and planted them here, where the dryads could finally be together.

The dryads enjoy playing card games, especially a simple bluffing game known as myriad. If the characters behave peacefully, the dryads challenge a willing character to a quick round. To win the game, a character must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma ([Deception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Deception)) check to out-bluff the dryads or a DC 17 Wisdom ([Insight](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to catch them in a lie.

##### What the Dryads Know

The dryads correctly suspect Juliana and Orlando are in the Palace of Spires but are hesitant to say anything. They see themselves in the missing lovers and won't risk bringing them to harm. However, if a character beats Sonna and Yvra at myriad, the dryads reluctantly suggest that Gnarlroot, the [treant](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/treant.md) in the south ravine (see area G12), might know more.

##### Key Leaves

The oak leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

##### Treasure

Fluttering in the branches of Sonna's tree is a [Cloak of Elvenkind](Mechanics/items/cloak-of-elvenkind.md). Yvra's tree has the set's matching [Boots of Elvenkind](Mechanics/items/boots-of-elvenkind.md) hidden in a hollow. One of the boots holds a leather pouch containing thin ivory plates whose illustrations resemble those of the storied Deck of Many Things. The deck is nonmagical and worth 100 gp. Yvra uses them to play a solitary card game called patience.

#### G6: Satyrs' Forest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This section of the forest is less dense, allowing light to dapple the ground. Clearings and paths abound, many of which show signs of regular use: discarded bottles, trampled earth, and ashes from old bonfires. The clearing ahead thrums with music and laughter.
^26c

Five [satyrs](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) revel in this forest. The largest clearing in the woods is surrounded by flowering shrubs and has a single towering elm tree in the center. The satyrs live here, sleeping on pallet beds surrounding the elm tree. Their leader, Xanim, carries a set of panpipes and leads their carousing.

Xanim and his kin (Kren, Vella, Zamuel, and Liss) are incorrigible gossips. They gleefully greet any newcomers and urge them to join the revelry.

##### Trapped Hollow

The satyrs' treasure is tucked into a hollow formed by the elm's gnarled roots and guarded by a hidden noose snare. A creature that steps close enough to search the root hollow must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be hoisted 20 feet into the air. The creature has the [restrained](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until it gets free by cutting the rope or slipping out as an action with a successful DC 16 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. A character who surveys the hollow from a distance and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check discovers the trap, which can be disarmed by poking it with a stick or tool to set it off.

##### What the Satyrs Know

If the characters share any juicy tidbits of gossip with the satyrs, such as the name of a secret crush, the satyrs respond with stories about other denizens of the garden, particularly the leprechauns. The satyrs show open annoyance at the leprechauns' pranks and hint that by offering the leprechauns a dance or fine meal, the characters might be able to persuade them to part with more information. The satyrs know of Juliana and Orlando but haven't met them; they eagerly look forward to partying with the "new arrivals."

##### Treasure

In the tree hollow is a leather sack containing 400 gp and a locked wooden box. As an action, a character can pick the lock with a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check using thieves' tools. The box holds three sapphires (200 gp each), a [Potion of Animal Friendship](Mechanics/items/potion-of-animal-friendship.md), a [Potion of Diminution](Mechanics/items/potion-of-diminution.md), a [Potion of Healing (greater)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), and a set of fine reed pipes worth 25 gp.

#### G7: Chimera's Crag

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rocky outcropping runs along the northern border of the garden. A small ravine cuts into the rocks, its floor scorched free of vegetation and dusted with ash.
^271

Gorguth the chimera drank from the Fountain All Heal and became enchanted by it. The chimera now lairs on a crag at the back of the ravine. Over the years, the magic of the garden kindled a spark of understanding in the creature. He is indifferent toward the garden's denizens and peaceful visitors.

Gorguth is a [chimera](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera.md) with the following changes:

- His alignment is chaotic neutral.  
- He speaks Common and Draconic.  

Gorguth enjoys flying over the garden, occasionally performing threatening but harmless swoops near anyone he sees. When he spots the characters, he makes an intimidating display, scorching the ground with his fire breath before landing on his crag to observe their reactions. Each character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to keep their composure. Characters immune to the [frightened](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition automatically succeed on this save. If any characters keep their composure, Gorguth becomes friendly and willing to chat. If every character fails the save, the chimera laughs and returns to the sky.

##### What Gorguth Knows

Gorguth observed Juliana and Orlando during their travels and knows they've spent a great deal of time talking with [the Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md), who lives in a cave across the lake (see area G20).

#### G8: Bears' Range

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A cave toward the northern edge of the garden overlooks a swath of wildflower-stippled grassland.
^274

A mated pair of awakened [brown bears](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/brown-bear.md) (see the "Awakened Animals" section) and their awakened cub (use the [black bear](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/black-bear.md) stat block) live in the cave and claim the surrounding area as their territory. The adult bears are hostile toward strangers but not violent unless provoked. Suspicious of visitors, they warn trespassers to back away from their den. The cub is indifferent—curious but skittish.

##### What the Bears Know

The bears' attitudes improve by one step if the characters offer them food or if a character explains the party's presence and succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check.

The cub observed Juliana and Orlando two days ago. She followed them to the Fountain All Heal (area G9), where the pair quenched their thirst. If the characters improved the cub's attitude, she gladly agrees to lead the characters to the fountain.

#### G9: Fountain All Heal

![The enchanting waters of t...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/065-04-008.fountain-all-heal.webp#center "The enchanting waters of the Fountain All Heal make its drinkers never want to leave the garden")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A spring of crystal-clear water bubbles up from the center of a natural rock basin. The water trickles down one side of the fountain, forming a small stream. Pink dog-rose blossoms grow around the basin.
^277

Caerwyn and Porphura worked together to create this miraculous fountain; over the ages, entrancing Feywild magic has permeated its waters. The basin is 4 feet wide and 3 feet deep. The water spilling from the basin streams down the slope toward the lake (area G18).

##### Curative Water

The fountain's waters are cool, pure, refreshing—and a potent magical elixir. A creature that drinks from the basin gains the benefits of both the [Greater Restoration](Mechanics/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell (all its benefits) and the [Heal](Mechanics/spells/heal.md) spell, and any entities possessing the drinker are forced out.

Any water scooped from the basin must be drunk immediately to benefit from its properties. If bottled or removed from the fountain, the water loses its magic and turns into gravel.

##### Entrancing Draught

A creature that drinks from the fountain must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or permanently lose all desire to leave the Eternal Garden. Fey and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. An affected creature resists any attempt to forcibly remove it from the garden. If the creature is removed from the garden, it is overcome with an irresistible desire to return. This effect can be removed only by a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell (such as those granted in the Palace of Spires, detailed later in this adventure); a carefully worded wish can free multiple creatures from the water's trance.

##### Key Leaves

The dog-rose leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

#### G10: Fairy Forest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Harmless insects abound in this forest. Butterflies, fireflies, and ladybugs flutter about, filling the canopy and undergrowth with flitting colors. A great willow tree atop a low hill sparkles with fairy lights and bioluminescent bugs.
^27c

This stretch of forest is home to a gathering of Fey folk. Six [pixies](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) and six [sprites](Mechanics/bestiary/fey/sprite.md) are present in and around the willow tree at any time. Though there are dozens of the Fey in total, most of them are gallivanting about the woods and the greater garden.

When the characters first enter the fairy forest, the six sprites here sneak up invisibly and attempt to learn more about the visitors. The sprites and pixies are hostile to any evil creatures they discover and try to drive such foes away.

##### Fairy House

The pixies and sprites live in an abandoned badger burrow in the willow hill. Only Tiny creatures can fit through the foot-tall fairy door set into the burrow's entrance. The Fey furnished and decorated the burrow like a tiny house; it has four rooms.

##### What the Fairies Know

To non-evil beings, the pixies and sprites are perfectly amiable, revealing themselves and welcoming such characters to their home. If the characters inquire about the garden or any of its residents, the Fey huddle up and whisper among themselves before a spokes-pixie cheerfully announces they'll happily help in exchange for a gift. The pixie accepts any magic item, anything shiny or sparkly, or anything with a story imparted by the character who offers it.

After receiving an acceptable gift, the fairies disclose that several of them spent some time at a picnic with Juliana and Orlando on the couple's first day in the garden and eventually led them to the Fountain All Heal (area G9) to quench their thirst.

##### Treasure

Hidden in the fairies' burrow are a [Potion of Clairvoyance](Mechanics/items/potion-of-clairvoyance.md) and a gold ring (250 gp) set with a [Pearl of Power](Mechanics/items/pearl-of-power.md).

#### G11: Barkburrs' Grove

![Spooky faces haunt the bur...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/066-04-009.barkburrs.webp#center "Spooky faces haunt the burled trees of the barkburrs' gloomy thicket")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A dense grove here consists of eerie oak trees. From the corner of the eye, the trees resemble looming figures with crooked fingers. A singularly gnarled and ancient oak rises from the center of the grove. Clusters of mistletoe grow all over its branches, and something sparkles between its roots.
^281

The smaller oak trees here evoke looming figures because they were all once people before they were transformed into trees by the two [barkburrs](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/barkburr-qftis.md) that cling to the central oak. The barkburrs attack any creature that comes within 20 feet of the tree. [The Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) doesn't punish creatures that defend themselves against the barkburrs, knowing more barkburrs will grow off the knobby oak in short order.

A creature [petrified](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Petrified) by the barkburrs can be returned to its true form by dunking its roots in the Fountain All Heal (area G9). It takes 1 minute for the transformed creature's roots to "drink" from the fountain's waters.

##### Key Leaves

The oak and mistletoe leaves here are keys to the teleportation sundial in the hedge maze (area G21).

##### Treasure

A sheathed [+1 Longsword](Mechanics/items/1-weapon.md)with a gem-encrusted hilt pokes up from the central oak's roots. The sword sheds light as a torch when drawn. Hanging from the high branches of a smaller oak is a black opal pendant (1,500 gp). A character who searches the grove and succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the pendant.

#### G12: Treant's Stand

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A limestone-walled ravine cuts into a rise in the land. A stream from the lake wends toward a low cave to the west. Trees, shrubs, and creepers grow near mossy boulders toward the back of the ravine to the east.
^285

A curmudgeonly and venerable [treant](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/treant.md), Gnarlroot, lives near the cave in the back of the ravine. He watches newcomers from afar and reveals himself only if they damage any plant life or approach his cave. When Gnarlroot emerges, he grumpily tells the characters to respect other people's homes.

##### Hidden Cave

A mossy cave hidden toward the back of the ravine holds a simple table and stool and a rack full of gardening tools. The furniture is for [the Gardener's](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) benefit, and both they and Gnarlroot use the tools to tend various plants in the garden. Characters who search the ravine and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check find the cave behind a curtain of ivy.

##### What Gnarlroot Knows

Gnarlroot often converses with the Gardener when the archfey stops by. He knows about Juliana and Orlando thanks to a recent visit from the archfey. If the characters agree to get off his lawn, Gnarlroot tells them the paramours were seen gathering leaves throughout the garden before entering the hedge maze (area G21).

##### Treasure

Hidden in a leather sack under some mossy rocks in the cave is a [Potion of Growth](Mechanics/items/potion-of-growth.md). A character searching the cave finds the stash with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check.

#### G13: Cave of the Toads

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A stream fed by the lake runs into a cave in the southern wall of a limestone ravine. The cave mouth is twenty feet wide and fifteen feet high.
^28a

The stream runs into a crack in the rock at the back of the 30-foot-deep cave. Two [giant toads](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-toad.md) lair in the cave, guarding their clutch of eggs. The toads are indifferent to the characters unless the characters come more than 10 feet into their den, at which point the toads croak angrily in defense of their eggs. A character can use an action to try to calm the toads, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. Once calmed, the toads allow the characters to explore the cave unhindered. The toads attack if their eggs are threatened.

##### Treasure

Wedged into the crack where the stream begins is a[ +1 Shield](Mechanics/items/1-shield.md) emblazoned with the image of a brightly painted frog.

#### G14: Centaurs' Meadow

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A meadow near the lake bursts with color from the wildflowers blanketing the grass. A small wooden structure resembling a cross between a cottage and a stable stands among the blossoms.
> 
> Bees buzz happily between the flowers and around a great hive enclosing the rear corner of the structure.
^28d

The meadow and structure are home to a family of four [centaurs](Mechanics/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md). The parents, Heraq and Persella, are initially wary of the characters and tersely ask them to state their business. The centaur children, Kari and Vinz, spend most of their time running through the meadows and swimming in the lake with the giant otters (area G18). If the characters are respectful, the centaurs invite them inside for tea sweetened with honey.

The bees are docile unless their hive is damaged. If a creature damages the beehive, a [swarm of insects (wasps)](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-wasps.md) erupts from the hive and attacks until the offending creature dies or flees.

##### Shelter

The centaurs' home has an open-air common room with a large trestle table, cooking utensils, and fresh fruit and nuts. Three bedrooms behind it house the family, two for the children and one for their parents. The rooms are appointed with straw mattresses and lockers containing brushes and simple upper-body clothing.

##### What the Centaurs Know

Kari and Vinz saw Juliana and Orlando enter the hedge maze (area G21) yesterday, but the couple never returned.

##### Treasure

A character can carefully harvest a single dose of magical honey from the hive without upsetting the bees with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. The honey collected functions as a [Potion of Vitality](Mechanics/items/potion-of-vitality.md).

![With sharp horns and even ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/067-04-010.stargleam-and-silverlily.webp#center "With sharp horns and even sharper wit, the unicorns Stargleam and Silverlily delight in philosophical debates")

#### G15: Unicorns' Meadow

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A rolling, green expanse of grass rises from the east shore of the lake to the color-flecked forest and steep cliff at the domain's eastern border.
^292

Two mated [unicorns](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) named Stargleam and Silverlily live here. They enjoy walking the paths of the hedge maze (area G21) and occasionally assist [the Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) in protecting the domain. It's been decades since their help was required, but they remain vigilant and intensely question newcomers to the garden.

##### What the Unicorns Know

The unicorns are initially standoffish and try to get the measure of anyone pumping them for information with a philosophical debate, such as when it's okay to lie to someone you love. A character who engages the unicorns in their debate and succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) or Intelligence ([History](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#History)) check earns the unicorns' grudging respect. Thereafter the unicorns are willing to discuss the garden and its inhabitants, including the entrancing power of the Fountain All Heal (area G9). The unicorns then reveal Juliana and Orlando are under its sway.

#### G16: Yellow Rose Arbor

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Walls of thorny hedges stand ten feet high in this meadow. An opening in the west wall leads into an arbor with thriving rose bushes covered in bright yellow roses.
^295

Two hedge-walled arbors mark the east meadow. The northern arbor grows yellow roses, while the southern arbor (area G17) grows red roses.

##### Hedges

The hedge wall is 5 feet thick and immune to all damage. A creature can force its way through the wall, spending 4 feet of movement for each foot traveled. Creatures that push through a hedge wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (`7d8`) piercing damage from its thorns on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Roses

The lovely scent of the roses fills the arbor inside the hedge walls, causing a drowsy euphoria in creatures that inhale it. A creature that breathes the scent must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 24 hours. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to the roses' perfume for 24 hours.

#### G17: Red Rose Arbor

Aside from its position and the color of the roses—the ones here are a deep, rich red—this arbor is identical to area G16.

#### G18: Lake

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A placid lake fed by a forest stream to the north reflects the colorful sky. Gossamer-winged dragonflies dance among the tall reeds and plants at the shore, and the lake's surface ripples with the splashes of playful otters. A small boat is tied to a stone jetty along the western shore.
> 
> A long, white stone building with a translucent roof and open archways rises from the center of the lake.
^29a

Two friendly giant otters ([giant weasels](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/giant-weasel.md) with a swimming speed of 40 feet) frolic in this shallow lake, which slopes gently from the shore to a depth of 10 feet. The otters are curious and playful; they dart up to investigate anyone in the lake.

The otters delight in bumping small boats and tugging on their rails. Each time an otter bumps a boat, creatures in it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the water. The otters are easily distracted by anyone tossing them small objects; they play with such objects in their paws, pass the objects between each other, or play fetch with whoever threw the objects.

##### Boat

A wide rowboat boat is tied to the jetty on the western bank. The boat can comfortably hold up to six Medium creatures and has two oars.

#### G19: Water Palace

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> At the center of the lake, a marble building gleams with gilded fittings. It has tall, glazed windows and is dotted with elongated archways. A veranda runs around the outside of the building ten feet above the water. Two stairways with ornate rails descend to a stone pier just above the lake's surface.
^29d

The water palace is a lovely place for relaxation and quiet meetings. It's open to all.

##### Main Floor

The main room is open and airy, with a long white table in the center surrounded by four padded chairs. A crystal decanter and four matching glasses sit on a silver tray.

##### Otter Den

The otters have a den in the flooded "basement" of the palace. A hole in the wall under the west side of the docking platform allows them to swim in and out of the den. The floor is covered in gravel, fish bones, and shells. Stairs ascend to a loft with a nest and four playful baby giant otters ([weasels](Mechanics/bestiary/beast/weasel.md) with a swimming speed of 30 feet).

#### G20: The Gardener's Rest

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A ten-foot-wide tunnel in a steep rise is supported by wooden beams and a lintel, which are covered in the pink blossoms of climbing dog-rose plants and hanging wisteria. A well-trodden grass path between verdant shrubs and wildflowers leads to the opening.
^2a1

This is the Gardener's home. The tunnel leads into a roughly hewn stone room with terraced shelves and many soil beds on the floor. Plants, mushrooms, moss, and lichen of all kinds grow in the beds. A door in the back wall leads to a room with a moss bed and stacks of books from other worlds, all discussing botany and nature.

[The Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) is present the first time the characters arrive. The archfey is friendly toward the characters and curiously inquires as to their business in the domain. After some initial investigation of the characters' intentions, the Gardener offers refreshment. If the characters have behaved peacefully toward the garden's denizens, the Gardener also casts the [Heroes' Feast](Mechanics/spells/heroes-feast.md) spell to produce a repast of delicious vegetables for the characters.

If the characters attack the Gardener, the archfey defends themself, all the while admonishing the characters for their rudeness and offering several chances to have a more polite discussion.

##### What the Gardener Knows

The Gardener is happy to answer general questions about the garden and its creators. If the characters are respectful, the archfey confirms that Juliana and Orlando are present in the domain. If asked either where the lovers are now or how to leave the garden, the Gardener encourages the characters to solve the hedge maze (area G21) to find what they're looking for.

##### Key Leaves

The dog-rose leaves here are a key to the teleportation sundial in the maze (area G21).

#### G21: Hedge Maze

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A fifteen-foot-high hedge wall with wickedly long thorns rises from the meadow. Three of the walls are solid; an opening in the western wall leads into a maze of hedgerow corridors.
^2a5

This shifting hedge maze surrounds the means to enter the Palace of Spires: a magic sundial.

##### Maze

Each time creatures enter the maze, the path through is different. To successfully navigate the maze, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check or reemerge at its starting point. Groups that enter the maze together make this check as a group check. A creature can create a more direct route by pushing through the walls, but it risks running afoul of the hedges' thorns (see the "Hedges" section below). A straight path between the center of the maze and its starting point has `1d3 + 1` hedge walls in the way.

Residents of the garden and any creatures that have succumbed to the entrancement of the Fountain All Heal (area G9) instinctively know the correct path through the maze, automatically succeeding on checks to navigate it.

##### Hedges

The hedge wall is 5 feet thick and immune to all damage. A creature can force its way through the wall, spending 4 feet of movement for each foot traveled. Creatures that push through a hedge wall must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (`7d8`) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Sundial

In the center of the maze is a rose-quartz sundial with a silver gnomon. The dial always shows noon during the day. Leaf-shaped impressions carved into the four corners of the sundial's face depict plants found throughout the garden: dog rose, mistletoe, oak, and shamrock. A character can identify the leaves with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Survival)) check.

The leaves act as keys to the sundial. If all the appropriate leaves are placed in their respective impressions, the sundial glows, and every creature in the center of the maze is transported to area P1 of the Palace of Spires (detailed in the following section). The leaves are then consumed.

The Sundial Keys table outlines where each type of key leaf can be found in the garden.

**Sundial Keys**

| Key Leaf | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Dog rose | Fountain All Heal (area G9), Gardener's Rest (area G20) |
| Mistletoe | Barkburrs' Grove (area G11) |
| Oak | Great Oak Tree (area G3), Dryads' Woods (area G5), Barkburrs' Grove (area G11) |
| Shamrock | Leprechaun Woods (area G2), Great Oak Tree (area G3) |

## Palace of Spires

![Tucked away in a demiplane...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/068-04-011.palace-of-spires.webp#center "Tucked away in a demiplane of its own, the Palace of Spires shields inhabitants from the worries of the world")

Porphura constructed this magnificent palace to house herself and Caerwyn, her beloved. The palace once stood where the hedge maze (area G21) now does, facing the lake in the garden. Composed of striking purple-red porphyry stone, the palace remains a comfortable domicile for those who find their way here now.

After Caerwyn's death, Porphura built a tomb for them both in the palace's crystal dome. With [the Gardener's](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) help, the grieving wizard performed her last great work: drawing the entire structure into a demiplane accessible only through the sundial at the heart of the maze. When all was arranged, she laid down with Caerwyn for the final time and let the magic that preserved her own life beyond its natural span end. The Gardener said their final farewell to Caerwyn and Porphura, sealed the tomb, and left the palace forever. Out of respect for their late friends, the Gardener won't enter the Palace of Spires for any reason.

### Palace of Spires Features

Unless otherwise specified, the Palace of Spires has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** Ceilings in the palace are vaulted and 40 feet high.  
- **Indestructible.** The palace and its furnishings are immune to all damage and can't have their forms changed.  
- **Lighting.** Soft light permeates the demiplane. Light outside the palace matches that of the Eternal Garden (see the "Eternal Garden Features" section), while interior areas are brightly lit by [Continual Flame](Mechanics/spells/continual-flame.md) spells.  
- **Secret Doors.** Some doors in the palace blend in with their surroundings. A character who searches for a secret door and succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Perception)) check finds it.  
- **Time.** Time in the demiplane moves at the same rate as in the Eternal Garden.  

### Palace of Spires Locations

The following locations are keyed to map 4.3.

> [!gallery]
> ![Map 4.3: Palace of Spires](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/069-map-4.03-palace-of-spires.webp#gallery)
> ![Player Version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/070-map-4.03-palace-of-spires-player.webp#gallery)

#### P1: Gatehouse

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A short, square tunnel constructed from purple-red stone leads to a lush garden enclosed in a courtyard. Behind you, a pair of close-meshed silver gates block the path. Beyond the gates wavers a colorful haze that occasionally provides a glimpse of the lake in the garden you left.
^2ad

Creatures who solve the sundial puzzle in the maze (area G21) arrive here. The silver gates can't be opened or damaged. If a creature slips through the bars or teleports past them, they can't travel beyond the haze, which is the boundary of the demiplane in which the palace resides.

#### P2: Walled Garden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Tall porphyry walls enclose a beautiful garden, and a glassy reflecting pool dances with the twilight colors of the sky above. Luminous butterflies flit above vivid flower beds that stand to the left and right of the pool.
> 
> Just outside the gatehouse stands a sundial identical to the one in the hedge maze. Paths of colorful gravel lead throughout the garden and to the palace proper.
^2af

The outer wall is 20 feet high, and the flowers in the garden remain perpetually in full bloom. The reflecting pool is 1 foot deep.

##### Sundial

The sundial here functions identically to the one in the hedge maze (area G21), but the leaves required to operate it don't grow within the demiplane. If the characters didn't bring extra leaves with them when they entered, they must find the reusable keys carried by the current occupants of the palace (see areas P6 and P7) to leave it. Activating this sundial returns the characters to the center of the maze.

#### P3: Corner Bowers

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Sweet, gentle music without a source fills this bower, which consists of a small, circular alcove with a padded bench and a canopy of flowering vines.
^2b2

These bowers are compelling spots to rest. The disembodied music soothes worry and weariness. A drowsy feeling washes over a creature that enters, though it is under no compulsion to sleep.

##### Refreshing Rest

A creature that finishes a short rest in the bower instead gains the benefits of finishing a long rest. The creature can't benefit from this property again for 24 hours.

#### P4: Entrance Porch

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A broad flight of porphyry steps ascends to a massive arched doorway. The arch over the double door protrudes from the wall and is supported by two stone columns carved in the likeness of two women, a human and an elf. Black letters across the arch read, "Enter in Peace."
> 
> The doors are ten feet wide, thirty feet high, and made of silver. They have no handles and are decorated with etched geometric patterns.
^2b5

The two column statues are depictions of Caerwyn and Porphura. The statues are living guardians (use the [earth elemental](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) stat block). They animate and attack anyone who tries to force the doors open by any means. The columns stop attacking a creature that ceases its attempt and lays down any weapons it's wielding. If all creatures do so, the guardians return to their original positions. If the guardians are destroyed, they reform at the next dawn.

##### Doors

The words above the door appear written in the preferred language of whoever reads them. The doors open for a creature only if that creature approaches the doors with no weapons bared. A character can force the doors open with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or with a [Knock](Mechanics/spells/knock.md) spell, but doing so prompts the guardians to attack.

#### P5: Entrance Hall

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This airy chamber's floor, walls, and lofty ceiling are made of gleaming white marble. Two doors lead from the room to the north and south. The hall's furnishings include two small, glass-topped tables, each with five chairs arranged around it. Each table holds a crystal decanter, five crystal glasses, and a bowl of fruit.
> 
> At the far end of the room, a large, semicircular atrium contains a splashing fountain. The atrium's soaring ceiling is transparent, letting the sky's colorful twilight glow fill the hall. An opaque rectangular shape darkens the center of the ceiling.
> 
> The fountain's central water jet climbs high above its pool. A metal staircase curves around the atrium's back wall to a landing forty feet above.
^2b8

Natural light fills this vast entry hall. The atrium's ceiling rises to 80 feet, while the fountain's water jet peaks at 60 feet. The opaque shape above the atrium is the sarcophagus in the tomb (area P12).

##### Disturbance

Sounds of combat or other loud, alarming noises in this area draw the attention of Juliana and Orlando in area P6 as well as Argus and Hamish, a pair of former adventurers in area P7. The latter two arm themselves and come quickly to investigate. Argus and Hamish ignore any ruckus that doesn't sound dangerous, attributing it to Juliana and Orlando and leaving the young couple their privacy.

##### Treasure

The decanters hold sweet wine, and the fruit is fresh and scrumptious. The two decanters are worth 50 gp each, and the ten glasses are worth 10 gp each. As long as they remain in the palace, the decanters and bowls refill every 24 hours.

#### P6: Juliana and Orlando's Room

![Juliana and Orlando lounge...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/071-04-012.juliana-and-orlando.webp#center "Juliana and Orlando lounge carefree in the palace, unaware two years have passed since they absconded")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> The floor of this spacious bedroom is decorated with mosaics depicting the four seasons. Covering one wall is a detailed tapestry showing two female mages, a human and an elf, picnicking in a woodland glade.
> 
> The furniture consists of a large four-poster bed, two chests, two worktables, six comfortable-looking chairs, and two couches. One of the couches hangs from the ceiling on delicate chains, and a young human man and woman relax on it as it gently sways. Slender golden perches dot the walls, and songbirds flit between them as they sing.
^2bc

This bedroom once belonged to Caerwyn and Porphura, but the denizens of the garden insisted that Juliana and Orlando inherit it. A secret doorway in the northwest corner opens onto a spiral staircase leading to area P10.

Juliana and Orlando (neutral good, human [nobles](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) with Armor Class 11 and no armor or weapons) recline together here on the suspended couch, relaxing and chatting. They're dressed in bright lounging robes with slippers. The pair are surprised but not perturbed by the characters' arrival if it's peaceful. They are indifferent to the characters, and to their perception, they have been in the Eternal Garden for only two days, not the two years that have already passed on the island of Sybarate.

Juliana and Orlando gladly relate their tragic tale of forbidden love with sincerity—if a touch melodramatically—and lament that their families can't see past the old feud. Eventually, it becomes clear the paramours have no intention of going home. A character who listens to the couple's story and succeeds on a DC 14 Intelligence ([Arcana](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check realizes they have fallen under the enchantment of the Fountain All Heal (area G9). Characters who visited the fountain earlier make this check with advantage.

##### Breaking the Enchantment

Juliana and Orlando are under the enchantment of the Fountain All Heal and regard the palace as their new home. Until they're freed from the domain's allure—such as by a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell granted in the tomb (see area P12)—they won't entertain any notion of leaving. If the effect on them is broken, the couple entertains reasonable arguments to return home and speak to their worried families.

##### Disturbance

Sounds of combat or other loud, alarming noises draw the attention of Argus and Hamish in area P7, who arm themselves and come quickly to investigate. The two ignore any noise that doesn't sound dangerous, preferring to give Juliana and Orlando their privacy.

##### Key Leaves

Juliana and Orlando each carry a set of gilt silver keys to the sundials in areas G21 and P2. The keys are metal replicas of the required leaves in lifelike detail. Unlike normal leaves, these keys aren't consumed by the sundial and travel with the user to the destination.

##### Treasure

The 20-foot-square tapestry depicts Caerwyn and Porphura, is worth 1,000 gp, and weighs 300 pounds.

Julianna and Orlando's possessions are stored in the secret closet behind the tapestry and include two sets of [fine clothes](Mechanics/items/fine-clothes.md), two [rapiers](Mechanics/items/rapier.md), two [breastplates](Mechanics/items/breastplate.md), a purse containing 30 gp and three diamonds worth 300 gp each, and a gold signet ring worth 50 gp bearing Orlando's family crest.

#### P7: Argus and Hamish's Room

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This bedroom's floor is a tile mosaic showing a night sky and a golden wheel with astrological symbols. The ceiling is similarly decorated with glittering gold stars.
> 
> The walls are whitewashed, and a tapestry covering one wall depicts two female mages, an elf and a human, holding hands. Their free hands are raised, producing magic that causes a magnificent garden to spring up around them as animals and fey creatures watch in awe.
> 
> The furniture in the room includes a large bed, two chests, six comfortable-looking chairs, two couches, and a wooden table. A suit of oiled leather armor, a round shield, and a well-worn spear adorn a mannequin in the corner.
> 
> Two middle-aged human men are present, one reclining on a couch with a book, the other sitting in a chair, whittling a piece of wood with a dagger.
^2c2

This well-maintained room includes a secret doorway in the southwest corner that opens onto a spiral staircase leading to area P10.

Argus Velon (lawful good, human [mage](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) and Hamish Parth (neutral good, human [gladiator](Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) are romantic partners and mercenaries. Sent by Governor Folcarae to rescue the young couple shortly after they absconded, Argus and Hamish succumbed to the Fountain All Heal and resolved to stay. When first encountered here, Argus is on a couch reading, and Hamish is whittling. Both wear silk lounging robes and slippers, with no other weapons or equipment. The couple are initially indifferent to newcomers but become friendly if approached peacefully.

The men tease each other fondly during conversation. They're grateful their dangerous vocation brought them together and eventually here. Like the other garden residents, Argus and Hamish believe Juliana and Orlando are the reincarnated creators of the garden—and they see their own love reflected in the couple. They're fiercely protective of the pair.

##### Breaking the Enchantment

If the characters break the fountain's enchantment on Argus and Hamish, the two are grateful but ultimately resolve to remain in the garden together of their own free will.

##### Key Leaves

Argus and Hamish each carry a set of gilt silver keys to the sundials in areas G21 and P2. The keys are metal replicas of the required leaves in lifelike detail. Unlike normal leaves, these keys aren't consumed and travel with the user to the destination. The couple also keeps sets of spare key leaves in a secret closet (see the "Treasure" section).

##### Treasure

The 20-foot-square tapestry depicts Caerwyn and Porphura, is worth 1,000 gp, and weighs 300 pounds.

A secret closet in the southeastern corner of the room holds Argus' [spellbook](Mechanics/items/spellbook.md), which contains all his prepared spells; a [Wand of Magic Detection](Mechanics/items/wand-of-magic-detection.md); an ivory inlaid box (150 gp) holding five sets of spare key leaves (see the "Key Leaves" section above); two [Potions of Healing (greater)](Mechanics/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md); and a bag with 10 pp, 20 gp, 15 sp, and a flawed emerald worth 500 gp.

#### P8: Gallery

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Curving metal stairs ascend to an art gallery that constitutes the palace's second floor. A low stone rail guards against falling over the edge into the entrance hall below.
> 
> Two rows of three marble statues stand in the gallery. The northern row depicts an elf woman in different poses and wearing either an elegant gown or druidic garb. The southern row shows a human woman in wizardly robes or smart finery. Two more statues occupy a pair of alcoves to the west.
> 
> On the wall directly ahead hangs a large painting showing the same couple dancing on the shores of a lake.
^2c7

The art in this room all depicts Caerwyn and Porphura. The pieces are affixed to the building and can't be moved from their positions or destroyed.

#### P9: Roof Gardens

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Crenelated parapets border the palace's open, flat roof. Four beds of subtly colored flowers are divided by gravel paths. In the center of the beds where the paths cross is a small table and four chairs.
^2c9

The roof gardens are lovely spots to sit and relax while enjoying an excellent view of the walled garden below (area P2).

#### P10: Crystal Bridges

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A delicate span of glass arches from the tower door to another spire twenty feet away. Nothing else supports the crystal bridge.
^2cb

The crystal bridges are perfectly sturdy despite their appearance and offer a safe but bracing walk to the upper rooftop garden.

#### P11: Upper Roof Garden

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> This roof garden is bound on three sides by a low, crenelated parapet and holds two long flower beds. The north bed holds spotless white roses, while the south bed contains roses of a deep red hue.
> 
> Between the flower beds, a crushed stone path leads to a flight of steps that rises to a round stone room surmounted by a transparent crystal dome.
^2cd

This garden leads the way to the tomb of Caerwyn and Porphura (area P12), offering a moment of serene contemplation and fresh air.

#### P12: Tomb of Caerwyn and Porphura

![Long after their happily e...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/072-04-013.sarcophagus.webp#center "Long after their happily ever after, Caerwyn and Porphura remain by each other's side")

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> A great crystal dome surmounts the circular wall of this room, and its floor is similarly transparent. Light from the twilight sky shines through the dome and into the entry hall far below.
> 
> A three-foot-high, white-marble sarcophagus rests in the center of the floor. Surmounting the slab are the carved figures of two women, a human and an elf, in repose. An engraving inlaid with gold glitters on the side of the slab at the figures' feet.
^2cf

As with other crystalline structures in the palace, the floor of this tomb is perfectly safe thanks to the indestructible nature of the demiplane's materials.

##### Final Rest

The sarcophagus holds the perfectly preserved remains of Caerwyn and Porphura. The carved figures on the lid are exquisitely lifelike in their rendering. As an action, a creature can open the sarcophagus with a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](Mechanics/Rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

##### Inscription

The gold lettering on the foot of the tomb is written in Common and reads as follows:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Oh stranger, whom destiny hath led nigh, Leave us interred in peace to lie. If thou wouldst deign to grant our request, Then fate will move at thy behest. This gift from the contented dead, We swear to grant by our heart and head.
^2d2

##### Treasure

The true treasure of the tomb is indicated by the inscription. If a creature visits the tomb but leaves its sarcophagus undisturbed, the magic of the palace grants the creature one casting of the [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell, fulfilled by the spirits of Caerwyn and Porphura on the creature's behalf. As the creature departs the tomb, a pair of joyful voices whisper to it in unison. The voices thank the creature for its respect and inform the creature that its next wish spoken aloud before it leaves the garden will be granted. A creature can gain only one wish from the tomb, no matter how many times it visits.

The tomb errs toward the spirit of a wish rather than the strict letter and doesn't twist the wisher's intent, especially if the wish is made to free a creature from the Fountain All Heal's enchanting draught. Feel free to allow wishes to be partially granted, or to simply inform a player their stated wish isn't fulfilled and they can try again.

If a creature opens the sarcophagus, the palace grants no further wishes, and any it has granted within the last 24 hours are immediately undone.

Inside the sarcophagus lie the perfectly preserved bodies of Caerwyn and Porphura in each other's arms as if only sleeping. Dressed in simple, white, linen robes, they wear matching gold rings (100 gp each). The interred lovers have no wish to return to life, and any magic used to resurrect them or speak to their corpses fails.

## Conclusion

If Juliana and Orlando are freed from the fountain's enchantment, they can easily be persuaded to return home to their families if the characters mention that two years have passed for their families or that their families have settled their feud. The couple takes some time to change into their original clothes and gather their equipment. They bid Argus and Hamish a fond, emotional farewell and depart with the characters.

### Returning to the Garden

When the characters leave the Palace of Spires and return to the garden, [the Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) is waiting for them in the center of the maze. How they greet the party depends on how the characters dealt with the tomb.

#### Respected the Tomb

If the characters didn't open the sarcophagus in Caerwyn and Porphura's tomb, the Gardener joyfully greets the characters as if they were old friends. The archfey speaks to each character of the character's individual exploits as if the Gardener witnessed them all, with sincere excitement and admiration. If anyone asks the Gardener about the other garden denizens' belief that Juliana and Orlando are the reincarnations of the gardens' creators, the archfey smiles and requests the characters allow the others to hold onto their beliefs, and to realize the truth—whatever it may be—in their own time. When asked directly if the young lovers are Caerwyn and Porphura reborn, the Gardener is slyly evasive with a twinkle in their eye.

After offering their well wishes, the Gardener hands each character (and Juliana and Orlando if they're present) a white flower petal and informs them the fairy ring (area G1) can take them home if they carry the petal into the circle. The archfey then gives a fond farewell and takes their leave.

When a creature carrying one of the petals steps into the fairy ring, a whirl of multicolored flower petals engulfs the creature and gracefully transports it to the mouth of the Cave of Echoes. The Gardener allows the characters, as well as Juliana and Orlando, to return to the Material Plane with their memories intact. A year has passed on the Material Plane for each day they spent in the Eternal Garden.

#### Desecrated the Tomb

If the characters opened the sarcophagus, a sense of creeping dread settles over them when they return to the maze, and the air has an uncomfortable chill—the garden's endless summer has ended. The hedges of the maze appear withered and dead, and [the Gardener](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-qftis.md) is furious. The archfey scolds any characters who participated in the desecration of the tomb, barely resisting resorting to violence.

With a final curse, the Gardener waves a hand, and an icy gale rips through the area, depositing the characters unceremoniously outside the Cave of Echoes. The fey crossing to the Eternal Garden never functions for them again.

Should the characters return to the garden by other means, the domain has become twisted and bitter. Plants are wilted, denizens are vicious, and the climate bears the cold bite of winter. The Gardener no longer eschews violence and seeks to vent their fury on the characters.

### Completing the Quest

Once returned to the Material Plane, the characters can deliver the news of their success (or failure) to Governor Folcarae. If the characters lingered in the garden, the governor is astonished to see them, remarking that she thought they'd never return.

#### With Juliana and Orlando

If the characters bring Juliana and Orlando home, the governor is overjoyed, letting her elation and relief crack her usually measured exterior. After a tearful reunion with her daughter and a slightly awkward but heartfelt welcome to Orlando, the governor pays the characters their promised reward in the form of 10 platinum trade bars. Each bar weighs 1 pound and is worth 500 gp.

#### Empty-Handed

If the characters failed to bring the missing lovers home, the governor is crestfallen but recovers her composure quickly. She thanks the characters for their efforts, but it's clear she's merely being polite. After the governor bids them a terse farewell, the characters can remain in Sybar for a few days before their welcome is obviously worn out. Word spreads of their failure, and merchants and innkeepers raise prices, add steep "taxes" to their goods, and eventually refuse service altogether.
