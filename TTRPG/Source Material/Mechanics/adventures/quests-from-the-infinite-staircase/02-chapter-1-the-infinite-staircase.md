# Chapter 1: The Infinite Staircase
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase* 

The Infinite Staircase ushers travelers to the destinations of their dreams. The impossible staircase winds in a surreal demiplane, ascending to every world, every plane of existence, and the adventure locations found among them. Though stories abound along its many steps, the staircase is the journey, not the destination—an extraordinary means of traversing the multiverse.

This chapter expands on what's written about the "Infinite Staircase" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" and provides tools for using it to convey creatures from one fantastical location to the next.

![While traversing the Infin...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/002-01-001.ch1-the-infinite-staircase.webp#center "While traversing the Infinite Staircase, two adventurers happen on the Censer of Dreams, a noble genie's palace")

## Staircase Features

The following sections describe features of the Infinite Staircase that are likely to come into play.

### Day and Night

The staircase doesn't experience day or night, existing in a perpetual state of twilight. Distant doors, twinkling like stars, provide dim light to the dreamlike realm, as does the staircase itself, which gives off an ambient glow in some stretches.

### Doors and Landings

Endless doors along the staircase connect it to destinations throughout the multiverse. These doors function as "planar portals" (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") and are typically closed, though most are unlocked and don't require portal keys to enter.

Each door on the staircase occupies a landing with at least two staircases connected to it, leading to and from other landings and their respective doors. The doors and their landings are altered by planar magic, taking on characteristics of their destinations. Red light seeps from the seams of a gloomy, jet-black door to the Shadowfell set into a gothic archway; gargoyles perch on its landing, exuding roiling mist from their open mouths. A slippery ramp of deep-blue ice ascends to a frozen portal to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, while a clammy bridge of basket fungus weaves toward a cavernous door to the Underdark.

Landings are frequent along the staircase but vary in distance from one another. Every landing contains at least one door. Travel between landings can take minutes, hours, or days.

### Gravity

On the Infinite Staircase, gravity is a logical force—until it isn't. The direction of its effect is perpendicular to the steps of the nearest staircase. Staircases twist, bend, and invert, occasionally allowing travelers on separate branches to look up at each other or leap from one part of the staircase to another.

A creature that falls off the staircase plummets `1d10 × 50` feet before crashing on the lower steps or the nearest landing below; it takes damage from the fall and lands with the [prone](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition as normal.

An object dropped on the staircase behaves predictably at first, falling down the steps until it comes to a halt or goes over the edge, at which point it continues "downward" until it collides with the next closest section of the staircase, and so on. Precious items lost in this way sometimes appear on the nearest landing, mysteriously returned to their owners.

### Indestructible

The Infinite Staircase is immune to all damage and can't have its form changed by spells like [Passwall](Mechanics/spells/passwall.md) or similar magic. No one knows who or what built the staircase—or continues to add to it. Its masons are never seen but often heard, their hammers ringing in the distance like rolling thunder.

### Movement on the Staircase

The staircase includes a multitude of inclines, not just stairs. Ramps, hovering platforms, and clockwork conveyor belts can all be found along its endless construction.

A traveler can also move along the Infinite Staircase simply by thinking about moving, causing the incline to propel them toward their destination. Steps might roll beneath them like a magical escalator or flatten under them to create a ramp. The walking speed (in feet) of a creature that chooses to move in this way is equal to 10 times its Charisma modifier (minimum speed of 10).

### Weather

The Infinite Staircase doesn't have seasons. Its ambient temperature remains constant, comparable to a cool autumn evening with a gentle breeze and breathable air. Storms and extreme weather effects, except those caused by the staircase's denizens and their lairs, are virtually nonexistent.

## The Iron Shadow

The portals of the Infinite Staircase often lead to places that exhibit a penchant for creativity—sites where art, invention, philosophy, and magic flourish. Wherever there's a story to be told, the staircase might be found. As creativity wanes in these places, their doors and destinations change, and their landings on the staircase vanish over time. However, one force plays a more active role in their destruction: the Iron Shadow.

The Iron Shadow is a creeping malady that feeds on creativity in all its forms. A rootless, rolling cloud of gloom exhaled by the Shadowfell, the Iron Shadow darkens the doors of the staircase, sapping inspiration, novelty, and motivation from the planes and their inhabitants. It snuffs the spark of innovation and leaves its victims apathetic and dull. Wherever the shadow falls, creativity dies.

### Palls of Gloom

Areas of the staircase plagued by the Iron Shadow appear cold and lifeless and are shrouded in palls of magical gloom. A creature that enters the gloom for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). If this effect increases a creature's level of [exhaustion](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) above 5, the creature becomes a [shadow](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) under the Iron Shadow's control. Nothing short of a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention can reverse this transformation.

If an area of bright light created by a spell of 3rd level or higher overlaps with an area of gloom, that gloom disappears for 1 hour. Only a [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell can permanently expunge a patch of the Iron Shadow from the staircase.

### Umbral Manifestations

Aspects of the Iron Shadow occasionally take on physical forms, manifesting as [memory webs](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/memory-web-qftis.md), [wraiths](Mechanics/bestiary/undead/wraith.md), or shadow dragons.

## Traversing the Staircase

No spell or magic item is required to access the Infinite Staircase, nor do its travelers have to contend with enigmatic rulers who dictate when its doors may open or who may pass through them. Unlike the city of Sigil, the crossroads of the multiverse, gods are free to enter and leave the Infinite Staircase as they please, though many reject it in favor of more direct methods of planar travel. The staircase is neutral ground accessible to all who can find and traverse it.

The act of traversing the staircase isn't any more tiring than walking, and creatures can't become exhausted by traveling along it.

### Finding the Staircase

Entrances to the Infinite Staircase usually appear as nondescript doors in dusty, forlorn places that don't get many visitors—or wherever is most convenient for adventure. On any given plane, multiple doors to the Infinite Staircase can exist, but known entrances are closely guarded secrets occasionally protected by [devas](Mechanics/bestiary/celestial/deva.md), sphinxes, yugoloths, and other powerful creatures. Likewise, these creatures sometimes stand watch on the staircase's landings, barring nefarious or unworthy travelers from passing through doorways to sensitive realms.

The Infinite Staircase Entrances table presents several places where an entrance to the Infinite Staircase might exist.

**Infinite Staircase Entrances**

`dice: [](02-chapter-1-the-infinite-staircase.md#^infinite-staircase-entrances)`

| dice: d10 | Entrance |

^infinite-staircase-entrances

#### Gates of the Moon

One fabled entrance to the staircase rests within the Gates of the Moon—a circular chamber within the shimmering palace Argentil, divine realm of the moon goddess Selûne on the plane of Ysgard. A spiral of silver steps, bathed in moonlight and entwined in dangling ivy, rises from the selenic hall, which some believe to be the base of the Infinite Staircase. Celestials, followers of Selûne, and lovers of the arts abound near the Gates of the Moon, which they regard as a sacred site.

### Locating Doors

Traveling to another plane requires locating a door that corresponds to the desired destination. There's no reason to the doors' arrangement, but creatures on the staircase longing for a specific destination feel the tug of its magic pulling them toward where they want to go. Finding the right door is a matter of exploration and time: locating the correct one takes `4d12` hours of travel. If a creature has visited the door before, this time is halved.

Doors along the staircase can lead anywhere. The Infinite Staircase Doors table provides a sampling of doors and destinations that characters might discover while exploring the Infinite Staircase.

## Nafas

Once there was everything, and once there was nothing but air. Then came a breath—a collective sigh exhaled by every plane and every world in one ephemeral gust. Multiversal winds blew into the Infinite Staircase through its doors, coalescing into Nafas (na-FASS), a noble genie infused with cosmic potential.

[Nafas](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md) is detailed in the following sections and in appendix B.

### Breath of the Multiverse

Wisps of twinkling multiversal dust trail Nafas wherever he goes, evidence of the djinni's deep connection to the planes that bore him. Calm, clement, and dressed in billowing fabrics, he drifts along the staircase like a zephyr, admiring its portals and the curious creatures that emerge from them.

Nafas isn't the creator of the Infinite Staircase or its ruler. He doesn't control the staircase or its doors, and he holds no sway over their destinations or who may enter through them. The djinni is a product of the multiverse, a distant observer bound to the realm by the circumstances of his creation.

An unwritten law dictates that there must always be a noble genie to watch over the Infinite Staircase. As a result, Nafas can never leave it. Any attempt to forcibly remove him from the Infinite Staircase, whether by magical means or otherwise, fails.

### Cosmic Storyteller

Nafas is a gifted storyteller and a gracious host. He regales visitors to his palace (detailed later in this chapter) with tales of longing that could soften steel and legends of triumph that chase grief from sorrow-laden hearts. Truth threads each captivating story, woven by Nafas from the whims of creatures throughout the multiverse. Carried on the winds, their spoken desires converge in his splendid halls.

Nafas has as many years behind him as the staircase has doors. Seemingly immortal, the djinni has collected and recited countless tales. Some fables repeated throughout the planes are inspired by these true accounts—or corruptions of stories still yet to be resolved—told to travelers who crossed paths with Nafas.

### Noble Genie

[Nafas](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md) is a noble genie, a rare type of genie endowed with the power to reshape reality. A word uttered by Nafas can transform a pauper into a prince, return the dead to life, or bring a meteor's might crashing down on his enemies. Unlike some of his more haughty, aristocratic counterparts that rule over vast demesnes of the Elemental Planes, Nafas's noble title isn't a result of bloodline or inheritance; it's a designation bestowed on him by the multiverse.

As a noble genie, Nafas can grant wishes, a power he doesn't take lightly. The djinni reserves his wish-granting magic for those he deems worthy. When Nafas does grant a wish—the greatest gift the djinni can give—he doesn't twist the benefactor's words or maliciously interpret their intentions, but his circumstances prevent him from freely conferring such gifts to deserving recipients outside the staircase.

Moved by the whims of yearning creatures on other planes but trapped within the Infinite Staircase, Nafas relies on adventurers to fulfill the wishes of those beyond the staircase's infinite thresholds. The djinni knows every door on the staircase and its destination, along with the origin of any wish that escapes through a door's seams.

#### Seeking Wishes

Characters might seek out the djinni to end a lasting effect, resurrect a fallen character, or solve an unsolvable problem. The following are some obstacles that Nafas can wish away:

- Destroying or unmaking a magic item  
- Learning the true name of a powerful enemy, such as an angel, an archfey, a demon, or a devil  
- Restoring a creature to life  
- Undoing a debilitating effect, like being transformed into a tree by a [barkburr](Mechanics/bestiary/plant/barkburr-qftis.md)  

### Wishes from the Infinite Staircase

Nafas might act as a patron who hires the characters to undertake the adventures in this book. Each adventure includes a "Using the Infinite Staircase" section that frames its central plot as a wish heard by Nafas.

The djinni or one of his messengers—such as a friendly [dust mephit](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/dust-mephit.md) formed of glimmering stardust—might appear to the characters along the staircase and invite them to seek rest at his palace. There, Nafas imparts the faraway plea he has heard and escorts the characters to the door where it originated. After the adventure, characters can return to the Infinite Staircase through the same door.

In exchange for fulfilling the wish of a creature beyond his reach, Nafas grants the characters a reward of their own. This reward might take the form of one or more of the following:

- **Magical Gift.** Nafas bestows a supernatural charm (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") on the party.  
- **Tale.** Nafas recites a story or poem that reveals information pertinent to a higher ambition or plane-spanning quest pursued by the characters.  
- **Wish.** Nafas grants the characters one to three castings of the [Wish](Mechanics/spells/wish.md) spell on their behalf. The djinni might require the characters to complete multiple adventures before allotting such a handsome gift.  

![The noble genie Nafas ente...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/004-01-003.the-genie-nafas.webp#center "The noble genie Nafas entertains guests with a thrilling story in his palace")

## Censer of Dreams

Nafas beckons weary travelers along the staircase to the Censer of Dreams, a bastion of respite in the continuous expanse. The Censer of Dreams is Nafas's lair. Regional effects for the palace are detailed in appendix B.

Created by Nafas to shelter visitors from other planes, the Censer of Dreams is a testament to the noble genie's generosity and might. Many who stumble on the Infinite Staircase glimpse the djinni's luxurious residence at some point during their journeys. A nexus held aloft by dozens of branching staircases, the palace envelops its visitors in unimaginable comforts.

The Censer of Dreams is a wonder of aeolian architecture shaped by a being of pure wind. Massive, shutterless windows line the bulbous fortress, allowing the djinni and other flying creatures to flit through its airy halls unimpeded. Hewn from smooth marble and perfumed with floral fragrances, its grand chambers hum with the pleasing tones of magical chimes hung from lofty ceilings. Windcatchers rise from the top of the structure to capture the gusts that buffet the palace and the staircases around it at all hours. Suffused with the djinni's magic, these winds batter would-be invaders, sending them over the staircase's edge.

### Censer of Dreams Features

The Censer of Dreams has the following features:

- **Unseen Stewards.** A staff of one hundred [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) zephyrs tends to the palace and its guests. Each of these stewards functions as if created by the [Unseen Servant](Mechanics/spells/unseen-servant.md) spell; however, the zephyrs are permanent fixtures that last until destroyed, and they can move anywhere in the palace without dissipating. Only Nafas and creatures he designates can command the zephyrs. A destroyed zephyr re-forms in a random location within the palace after `1d4` days.  
- **Winds.** Winds perpetually swirl around the Censer of Dreams and the staircases that lead to it. Creatures on the Infinite Staircase can find the palace by following the direction of the wind.  
- **Wishes.** Fleeting voices can be heard throughout the palace, whispering the desires of creatures throughout the multiverse.  

### Palace Visitors

Travelers from every world are welcome within the Censer of Dreams. Nafas values all perspectives and rarely refuses entrants, believing that everyone has a story worth telling. However, troublemakers who offend the djinni or threaten the safety of other visitors are ousted from the palace.

Some genies, especially those from the Elemental Plane of Air, pilgrimage to the Censer of Dreams to hear stories from Nafas. Others hope to join his court and one day earn the title of noble genie themselves.

### Noteworthy Sites

Amid an endless sea of steps, the Censer of Dreams embodies the boundless potential of a wish granted. Its opulent chambers boast heavenly gardens visited by Celestials, sprawling courtyards paved with silver bricks, and the secret desires of the multiverse.

#### Foyer

Nafas receives visitors in the foyer—a wide, windowed reception hall that looks out on the Infinite Staircase. As one enters the foyer, they're greeted by a roaring ramp of tangible wind that curls up to the rest of the palace. The updraft supports even the heaviest of creatures, which can easily amble up the windy incline to the areas above. Plush pillows, warm fireplaces, and delectable treats number among the amenities available in the hall.

#### Den of Chronicles

Tales come alive in the Den of Chronicles, a storyteller's sanctuary. In the carpeted hall, Nafas weaves a never-ending tapestry of tales from the wishes he has heard.

An immense, jeweled censer hangs from the ceiling on a golden chain. Whenever a story begins, sweet-smelling incense wafts from the receptacle and spreads throughout the palace, notifying its visitors that a new chronicle is about to unfold. As the narrator—whether Nafas or another raconteur—speaks, the fumes take the forms of subjects within the story, dancing to each turn of phrase. Meanwhile, animated kettles distribute steaming cups of hot tea to avid listeners seated within the hall.

Nafas delights in hearing the stories of his visitors, especially tales of adventures beyond the Infinite Staircase. Easily moved, the djinni disarms audiences with his booming laugh and profound sobs.

#### Guest Quarters

The palace's accommodations are individualized oases sprinkled with genie magic. Illusions within each room tailor its contents to the preferences of its guests, transforming it into a personal utopia. A traveler who hails from a snowy tundra might melt at the sight of a rustic mountain lodge, complete with a crackling hearth, a bearskin rug, and the savory scent of dwarven ale. The next room over might appear as a beachside bungalow, a peaceful elven glade, or a wizard's scriptorium. Every room is someone's paradise.

![Travelers from all places ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-3/5etools-img/main/adventure/QftIS/005-01-004.censer-of-dreams.webp#center "Travelers from all places arrive at the Censer of Dreams, Nafas's palace on the Infinite Staircase")

#### Well of Destiny

The voices of the multiverse cry out in the Well of Destiny. A sanctum located within the silvery dome that rises from the center of the palace, the Well of Destiny is a magnet for the words of hopeful souls manifesting their desires to the winds. When he isn't entertaining guests, Nafas can usually be found here, seated on his throne: a weightless, high-backed chair sculpted from the clouds that pervade the misty chamber. The djinni reflects on each wish he hears, contemplating the stories behind them.

Each time a wish is spoken somewhere in the multiverse, it echoes in the Well of Destiny, amplified by the Infinite Staircase's ambient magic. The Well of Destiny Wishes table includes examples of wishes that might be heard within the hall or the staircases beyond, inspiring characters to adventure or giving them a reason to seek out Nafas.

## Staircase Adventures

The adventures in this book take the characters to wondrous realms beyond the Infinite Staircase, but some quests might take place on the staircase itself. The Infinite Staircase Adventures table offers suggestions for stories involving the extradimensional realm.

**Infinite Staircase Adventures**

`dice: [](02-chapter-1-the-infinite-staircase.md#^infinite-staircase-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The Iron Shadow spreads to a character's home world, leaving it a gray, apathetic husk. A survivor asks the characters to repair the damage. |
| 2 | For reasons unknown, the masons construct a gloomy staircase to an evil, nightmarish realm. Unsupervised, its doors release horrors that wreak havoc on other worlds. [Nafas](Mechanics/bestiary/npc/nafas-qftis.md) hires the characters to seal the portals. |
| 3 | A powerful [efreeti](Mechanics/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) from the City of Brass sets out to conquer numerous worlds through the doors of the Infinite Staircase. Nafas charges the characters with foiling the efreeti's scheme. |
