# Simic Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [enhance ability](Mechanics/spells/enhance-ability.md) (3rd-level version), [enlarge/reduce](Mechanics/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), or [gaseous form](Mechanics/spells/gaseous-form.md) spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
