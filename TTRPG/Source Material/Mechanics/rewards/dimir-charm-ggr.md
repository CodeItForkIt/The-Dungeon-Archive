# Dimir Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [blink](Mechanics/spells/blink.md) or [sleep](Mechanics/spells/sleep.md) (3rd-level version) spell. Alternatively, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [invisible](Mechanics/Rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
