# Tyrant Ship
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide p. 54*  

[Beholders](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) carve tyrant ships out of stone using their disintegration rays and use these ships to wander the Astral Plane, looking for worlds to conquer and rival beholders to destroy. No two tyrant ships look alike, but they all have one or more features reminiscent of their creators, such as a bulbous shape and eyestalks.

A spherical chamber on the ship's command deck functions as a [spelljamming helm](Mechanics/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) that only beholders can attune to. Any beholder that occupies this chamber can attune to it. Reducing a tyrant ship to 0 hit points not only destroys it but also destroys the ship's [spelljamming helm](Mechanics/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) and eyestalk cannons.

A tyrant ship can't float on water, but it can safely land on the ground.

This weapon looks like an eye mounted on an eyestalk. A beholder stationed in one of the tyrant ship's meditation pods can see through the eye by concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) and use an action to make the following attack.

**Destructive Ray** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`10d6`) force damage.
