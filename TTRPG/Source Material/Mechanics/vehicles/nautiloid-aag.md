# Nautiloid
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide p. 38*  

Built and used by [mind flayers](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md), nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can't float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.

As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid's [spelljamming helm](Mechanics/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the [spelljamming helm](Mechanics/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md). Each time this property is used, roll a `d6`. On a 5–6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can't be used again for 24 hours.
