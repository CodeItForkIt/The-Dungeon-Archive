# Lamprey Ship
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide p. 34*  

Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. [Psurlons](Mechanics/bestiary/aberration/psurlon-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie") are particularly fond of them.

Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.

A lamprey can float on water, though it can't land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.
