----
The main premise of this build is a combination of two spells, [[darkness]] and [[eldritch-blast]]. Once combat starts, cast [[darkness]] on an object you're holding. You'll be able to see through it and no enemies will be able to so you'll have advantage. If you really want to be powerful, I would suggest taking [[elf]] instead of [[human]] and getting [[elven-accuracy-xge]] to have a almost guaranteed chance to hit.
