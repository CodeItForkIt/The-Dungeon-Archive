# Silvery Barbs
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) and use the lower roll.

You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.
