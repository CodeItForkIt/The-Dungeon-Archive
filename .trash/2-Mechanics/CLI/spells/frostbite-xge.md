%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`)).
