# Ray of Sickness
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`) poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(1d8)` for each slot level above 1st.
