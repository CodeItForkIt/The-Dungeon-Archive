*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage and subtract `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) when you reach certain levels: 5th level (`dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`)), 11th level (`dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d6|noform|avg` (`4d6`)).
