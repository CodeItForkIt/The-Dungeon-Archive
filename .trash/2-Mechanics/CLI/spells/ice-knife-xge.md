# Ice Knife
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S, a drop of water or piece of ice
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(1d6)` for each slot level above 1st.
