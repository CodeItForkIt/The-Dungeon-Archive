# Silence
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
