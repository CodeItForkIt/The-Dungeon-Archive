You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

The spell's damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`)), 11th level (`dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`)).
