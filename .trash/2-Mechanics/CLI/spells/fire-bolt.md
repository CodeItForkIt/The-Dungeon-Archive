You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

This spell's damage increases by `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) when you reach 5th level (`dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`)), 11th level (`dice:3d10|noform|avg` (`3d10`)), and 17th level (`dice:4d10|noform|avg` (`4d10`)).
