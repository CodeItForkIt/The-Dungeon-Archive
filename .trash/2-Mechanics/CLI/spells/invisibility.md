%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, an eyelash encased in gum arabic
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
