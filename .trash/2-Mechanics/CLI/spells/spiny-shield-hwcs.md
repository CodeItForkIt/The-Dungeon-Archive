# Spiny Shield
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a small quill
- **Duration:** 1 round

An ethereal barrier of spikes, made of magical force, interposes itself between you and an attacker. Until your next turn, when you are hit by a melee attack, the barrier reduces the damage you are dealt by `dice:2d4|noform|avg` (`2d4`), and deals the same amount of piercing damage to the attacker. The shield is ineffective against ranged attackers, but still provides a +2 bonus to AC (treat as half cover) against them for the duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 1st level, increase the spell's effect by an additional `dice:1d4|noform|avg|text(1d4)` for every slot level above 1st.
