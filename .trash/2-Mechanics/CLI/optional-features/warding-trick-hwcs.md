# Warding Trick
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

> [!note]
> This is a magical effect. A gentle cleric taught you how to channel your magic into a protective veil. You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as an action to grant an ally you can see within 60 feet of you a number of temporary hit points equal to your roll on the Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). This ward lasts for as long as you maintain concentration on it, up to 10 minutes.

At 6th level, your practice allows you to weave wards that retaliate against those who would harm your allies. Any creature who deals damage to an ally with temporary hit points granted by this effect must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature dealing damage takes an amount of radiant damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.

At 14th level, you have learned how to make your ward even more resilient. For the duration of the effect, at the beginning of each round on your turn the target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your Bardic Inspiration die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). These replace any previous temporary hit points.
