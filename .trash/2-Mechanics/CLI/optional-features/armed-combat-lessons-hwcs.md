# Armed Combat Lessons
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

A seasoned fighter taught you how to use a simple combat stance to wield your weapons more effectively. When you select this option, choose from the following **Fighting Styles**:

- [Archery](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/archery.md): You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.  
- [Dueling](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/dueling.md): When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.  
- [Great Weapon Fighting](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/great-weapon-fighting.md): When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.  
- [Two-Weapon Fighting](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/two-weapon-fighting.md): When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier.  

When you make a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, adding your Bardic Inspiration die to the attack or damage roll. When you do this, you gain the benefits of your chosen Fighting Style for 10 minutes.

At 6th level, you learn how to use your stance to chain your attacks together in deadly combination. Once, while your Fighting Style is active, you may attack twice, instead of once, when taking the Attack action on your turn.

At 14th level you have learned to shore up any weaknesses in your stance. You gain +1 to your AC for the effect's duration.
