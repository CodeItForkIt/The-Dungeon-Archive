# Acrobatics Lessons
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 36*  

A slick rogue once gave you some pointers on zigging and zagging. When you or an ally makes a Dexterity saving throw, you may expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and adding the result to the saving throw. An ally must be within 60 feet of you and able to see and hear you to benefit from this trick.

At 6th level, if the target succeeds the saving throw against an effect that would deal half damage on a successful save, the target takes no damage instead.

At 14th level, even if the target fails their saving throw they only take half damage from the effect.
