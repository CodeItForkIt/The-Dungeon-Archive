*[Bard](bard.md): Bard College*

## Class Features

### College of the Road (Level 3)

Not an officially recognized college, the College of the Road represents the personal and eclectic sets of skills, knowledge, and techniques a wandering bard picks up along their journey. As inveterate jacks-of-all-trades, bards possess a variety of aptitudes in combat, magecraft, and general know-how, making them particularly well suited to learning a variety of different skills. It often happens that while traveling, a bard winds up sharing their campfire with a motley assortment of wandering adventurers who may impart valuable lessons in exchange for a lively song or a well-told tale. Compared to students of other Bard Colleges, a special kind of sensibility is important for the College of the Road. How effectively a bard of this College can apply what they have learned depends on their understanding and insight. The College of the Road is sometimes a harsh teacher, but bards who follow this path often find themselves rewarded with a diverse array of useful tricks and tactics. Those who underestimate a bard from the College of the Road soon find that these "graduates" are full of surprises.

- You gain proficiency with a martial weapon of your choice  
- You gain proficiency with [Herbalism Kits](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md)

- You gain proficiency with a skill of your choice  
- You learn two languages of your choice

At 3rd level, you can share any useful tidbits of information you have come across in your travels to help others to see problems from a new angle. When a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die granted by you, they may make a single [Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History), [Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) check with advantage. The creature may choose whether or not to add the Bardic Inspiration die to this roll.

#### Traveler's Tricks

At 3rd level you already have several memorable experiences from your life on the road. You learn two Traveler's Tricks of your choice (see Traveler's Trick Options).

These Traveler's Tricks represent skills, techniques, and useful pieces of knowledge picked up along the way. Each one requires you to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, and takes a bonus action to use unless otherwise specified.

At 6th level and at 14th level you learn an additional Traveler's Trick.

#### Traveler's Trick Options

The Traveler's Trick feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. Each one is associated with a different class.

Unlike traditional bard abilities which rely on skill or panache to be properly executed, the greatest asset for picking up tricks along the road is common sense and an openness to learning new ideas. Wisdom affects how powerful your traveler's tricks are, as well as how hard they are to counter. If an option requires a saving throw, your Traveler's Trick save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

### Favorite Trick (Level 6)

At 6th level, you have gained enough mastery over one of your Traveler's Tricks that you can use it whenever it's needed. You may choose one Traveler's Trick that you know and designate it as your favorite trick. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration remaining, you regain one use of it. Any Bardic Inspiration gained in this way can only be used to perform your favorite trick.

### Improved Tricks (Level 6)

At 6th level, your Traveler's Tricks become stronger. By practicing the tricks you know, and encountering stronger adventurers who share their knowledge with you, your mastery over your tricks increases.

### Traveler's Tricks (Level 6)

At 6th level you learn an additional Traveler's Trick.

### Favorite Trick (Level 14)

At 14th level you can select a second favorite trick from among Traveler's Tricks you know.

### Improved Tricks (Level 14)

At 14th level, your Traveler's Tricks become stronger. By practicing the tricks you know, and encountering stronger adventurers who share their knowledge with you, your mastery over your tricks increases.

### Traveler's Tricks (Level 14)

At 14th level you learn an additional Traveler's Trick.
