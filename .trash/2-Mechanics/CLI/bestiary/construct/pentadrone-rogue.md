## Traits

***Disintegration.*** If the pentadrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The pentadrone makes five arm attacks.

***Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Paralysis Gas (Recharge 5-6).*** The pentadrone exhales a 30-foot cone of gas. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
