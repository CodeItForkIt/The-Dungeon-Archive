## Traits

***Immutable Existence.*** The servant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of existence.

***Magic Resistance.*** The servant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.

***Regeneration.*** The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, this trait doesn't function until an attuned creature spends 24 hours repairing the artifact or until the artifact is subjected to lightning damage.

***Standing Leap.*** The servant's long jump is up to 50 feet and its high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start.

***Unusual Nature.*** The servant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Destructive Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+17|noform|text(+17)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d12+10|noform|avg|text(36)` (`4d12 + 10`) force damage. Or Ranged Weapon Attack: `dice:1d20+17|noform|text(+17)` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d12+10|noform|avg|text(36)` (`4d12 + 10`) force damage. If the target is an object, it takes triple damage.

***Crushing Leap.*** If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the servant and must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:4d12|noform|avg|text(26)` (`4d12`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
