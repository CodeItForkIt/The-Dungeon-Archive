## Traits

***Constructed Nature.*** The swarm doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Spider Climb.*** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the swarm knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|text(+3)` to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* `dice:4d4|noform|avg|text(10)` (`4d4`) piercing damage, or `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
