# Thessalheart Construct
*Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild p. 86*  

A thessalheart construct is created with a connection to the life energy of another creature, allowing that creature to regenerate back from the dead as long as the construct is not destroyed. The artificer Thessalar created this crafty construct, and uses it to imbue his greater monstrous creations with even more power.

## Traits

***Telepathic Bond.*** While the construct is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically.

## Actions

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instead [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) minutes and [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) while [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way.
