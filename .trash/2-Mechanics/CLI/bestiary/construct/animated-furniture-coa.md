## Traits

***Immutable Form.*** The animated furniture is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The animated furniture has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The animated furniture's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The animated furniture makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d8+6|noform|avg|text(19)` (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Slow (Recharge 5-6).*** The animated furniture targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
