## Traits

***Shared Spells.*** Any spell the [goat-knight](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kraghammer-goat-knight-tdcsr.md) casts with a range of self also targets the goat .

***Summoned Nature.*** When a goat-knight steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. The [goat-knight](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kraghammer-goat-knight-tdcsr.md) can also dismiss the steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, the same steed is summoned when the [goat-knight](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/kraghammer-goat-knight-tdcsr.md) casts [find steed](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-steed.md).

***Charge.*** If the goat-knight steed moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

***Sure-Footed.*** The goat-knight steed has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

## Actions

***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d4+3|noform|avg|text(8)` (`2d4 + 3`) bludgeoning damage.
