## Traits

***Elemental Demise.*** If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.

***Disguises.*** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the [true polymorph](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md), [disguise self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) (often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([air elemental](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) only), [creation](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/creation.md), [gaseous form](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [major image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)

**3/day each**: [create food and water](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (can create wine instead of water), [tongues](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md), [wind walk](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wind-walk.md), [true polymorph](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-polymorph.md) (mightier genies only; see Disguises)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+5|noform|avg|text(12)` (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage plus `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
