## Traits

***Air Form.*** The apparition can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The apparition makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+5|noform|avg|text(14)` (`2d8 + 5`) acid damage.

***Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6).*** Each creature in the apparition's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes `dice:3d8+2|noform|avg|text(15)` (`3d8 + 2`) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the apparition in a random direction and knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
