## Traits

***Invisible in Water.*** The wine weird is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) while fully immersed in water.

***Water Bound.*** The wine weird dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+3|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 feet toward the wine weird. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), the wine weird tries to drown it, and the wine weird can't constrict another target.
