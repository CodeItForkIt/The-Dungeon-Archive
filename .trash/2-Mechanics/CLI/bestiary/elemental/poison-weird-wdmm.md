## Traits

***Invisible in Water.*** The weird is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) while fully immersed in toxic brew.

***Brew Bound.*** The weird dies if forced to leave the basin of toxic brew it inhabits, or if a [purify food and drink](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md) spell is cast on the brew.

***Poisonous Body.*** A creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns while [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by a poison weird.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+3|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 feet toward the poison weird. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), the poison weird tries to drown it, and the poison weird can't constrict another target.
