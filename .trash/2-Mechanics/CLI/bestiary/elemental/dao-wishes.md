## Traits

***Earth Glide.*** The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

***Elemental Demise.*** If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.

***Sure-Footed.*** The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

***Wishes.*** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.

To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [stone shape](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([earth elemental](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/earth-elemental.md) only), [gaseous form](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [phantasmal killer](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md), [wall of stone](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md)

**3/day each**: [passwall](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/passwall.md), [move earth](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/move-earth.md), [tongues](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tongues.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+6|noform|avg|text(15)` (`2d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d6+6|noform|avg|text(20)` (`4d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
