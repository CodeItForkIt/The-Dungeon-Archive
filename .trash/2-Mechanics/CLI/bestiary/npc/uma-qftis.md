## Traits

***Brave.*** Uma has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Uma makes two melee attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+3|noform|avg|text(10)` (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+2|noform|text(+2)` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, Uma can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) to its roll provided it can hear and understand Uma. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Uma is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Uma adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Uma must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
