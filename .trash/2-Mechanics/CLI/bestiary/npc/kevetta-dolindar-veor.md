## Traits

***Psychic Leech.*** At the start of each of Kevetta's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) psychic damage.

***Thrives on Company.*** Kevetta has advantage on attack rolls while it is within 30 feet of at least two other creatures. It otherwise has disadvantage on attack rolls.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Kevetta makes one Harpoon Arm attack, and it uses Sorrowful Embrace.

***Harpoon Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d8+3|noform|avg|text(21)` (`4d8 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Kevetta has two harpoon arms and can grapple up to two creatures at once.

***Sorrowful Embrace.*** Each creature [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by Kevetta must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking `dice:4d8|noform|avg|text(18)` (`4d8`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, Kevetta pulls each of those creatures up to 30 feet straight toward it.
