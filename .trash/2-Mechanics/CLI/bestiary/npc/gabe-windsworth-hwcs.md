# Gabe Windsworth
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 202*  

Gabe is a middle-aged sable luma with a large plume of iridescent feathers that surround his nape like a cowl. The Dean of the Avium, Gabe always appears as though he is deep in thought. Though his amiability and kooky behavior cause people to underestimate him, beneath the quirky exterior lies a keen mind that carefully evaluates all possibilities before taking action. He is a good-natured scholar who is just as concerned with the wellbeing of his staff and students as he is with the quality of research and education within the Avium. Dean Windsworth uses the [luma wizard](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/luma-wizard-hwcs.md) stat block. His alignment is neutral good.

## Traits

***Glide.*** When falling at least 10 feet, Gabe can spend a reaction to fly up to his speed in one direction as he descends. He lands in an unoccupied space at the end of his movement, and takes no falling damage. He cannot glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though he can drop any held items as part of his reaction).

***Wing Flap.*** As a bonus action, Gabe can use his powerful feathered arms to propel himself upward up to half his movement speed. Gabe can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding.

***Fated (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** Gabe can choose to reroll any attack, skill check, or saving throw.

***Resilience.*** Gabe has advantage on saving throws against poison.

## Reactions
