# Withers
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 145*  

Before he was turned into an undead creature, Withers was an Omuan engineer named Gorra. Like all of Omu's citizens, Gorra was enslaved and put to work constructing the tomb. When Acererak sacrificed his workers to their own dungeon, Gorra's traps performed the best.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Withers makes two longsword attacks. He can use his Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the Withers's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Withers can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d8 + 2`) slashing damage, or `dice:1d10+2|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d10 + 2`) slashing damage if used with two hands.
