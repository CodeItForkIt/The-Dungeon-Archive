## Traits

***Divinely Blessed.*** Alyxian can't be [surprised](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised) and can't be changed into another form against his will.

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Special Equipment.*** Alyxian carries a magic dagger that he uses to make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. In the hands of creatures other than Alyxian, the dagger is nonmagical and has no special properties.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) radiant damage.

***Stoneheart Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d4+4|noform|avg|text(11)` (`3d4 + 4`) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) as the dagger lodges itself in the target's body. While the dagger is lodged in the target, magic can't end the [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) condition on it and Alyxian can't make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. A creature within reach of the [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) target can use an action to try to remove the dagger, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength check.

## Bonus Actions

***Summon Dagger.*** Alyxian's Stoneheart Dagger teleports into his free hand, provided he has one.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Alyxian makes one Spear or Stoneheart Dagger attack.

***Warrior's Stride.*** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Ruidium Shard (Costs 2 Actions).*** A gem-sized shard of ruidium appears at a point Alyxian can see within 120 feet of himself and explodes. Each creature, other than Alyxian, in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). If a creature isn't suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted when it fails the saving throw.
