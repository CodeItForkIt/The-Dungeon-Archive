# Zorhanna's Simulacrum
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 184*  

Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption. An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The simulacrum has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Simulacrum.*** The simulacrum can't regain expended spell slots or use the properties of the shard solitaire necklace. (The shard solitaire is currently attuned to the Far Realm entity trapped inside.) If the simulacrum drops to 0 hit points, it turns to snow and melts away, and the shard solitaire necklace teleports to the safe in Zorhanna's vault tower.

***Spellcasting.*** The simulacrum is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit with spell attacks). The simulacrum can cast [disguise self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) and [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) at will and has the following wizard spells prepared:

**At will**: [disguise self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md), [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md)
