## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Eriflamme fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The Eriflamme has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Eriflamme makes four Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Bite attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+18|noform|text(+18)` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+10|noform|avg|text(20)` (`3d6 + 10`) slashing damage plus `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) fire damage.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+18|noform|text(+18)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d6+10|noform|avg|text(24)` (`4d6 + 10`) piercing damage plus `dice:6d10|noform|avg|text(33)` (`6d10`) fire damage.

***Reform.*** All the Eriflamme's fire elementals vanish and the Eriflamme reappears in one of their spaces. The Eriflamme's hit points are equivalent to the combined hit points of the fire elementals.

## Reactions

***Split (2/Day).*** As a reaction to taking damage, the Eriflamme can split into fire elementals and reduce the damage to 0. The Eriflamme can form up to 10 [fire elementals](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental.md), splitting its remaining hit points between them. The fire elementals appear in spaces adjacent to or within the Eriflamme's old location, and all act on the Eriflamme's initiative. They gain a +5 bonus to attack rolls and have the Eriflamme's Reform action.

## Legendary Actions

***Slam.*** The Eriflamme makes a Claw attack, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage if it hits.

***Fireglide.*** The Eriflamme moves up to half its speed. It can fly during this movement.

***Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Eriflamme makes a Bite attack with advantage.
