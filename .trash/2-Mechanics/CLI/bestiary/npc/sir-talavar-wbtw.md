# Sir Talavar

Sir Talavar is an esteemed member of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. Many of Sir Talavar's squires have gone on to become knights of great renown. The venerable faerie dragon has an encouraging, can-do demeanor and an unwavering sense of honor.

## Traits

***Superior Invisibility.*** As a bonus action, Sir Talavar can magically turn [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until his [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment Sir Talavar wears or carries is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) with him.

***Limited Telepathy.*** Using telepathy, Sir Talavar can magically communicate with any other faerie dragon within 60 feet of him.

***Magic Resistance.*** Sir Talavar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Sir Talavar's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components. As the dragon ages and changes color, it gains additional spells as shown below.

**1/day**: [color spray](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/color-spray.md) (Orange), [mirror image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mirror-image.md) (Yellow), [suggestion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md) (Green), [major image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md) (Blue), [hallucinatory terrain](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) (Indigo), [polymorph](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md) (Violet)

**1/day each**: [dancing lights](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [mage hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md)

## Actions

***+1 Tiny Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+6|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d4 + 6`) piercing damage.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.

***Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Sir Talavar exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`) at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:

- **1-4.** The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.  
- **5-6.** The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
