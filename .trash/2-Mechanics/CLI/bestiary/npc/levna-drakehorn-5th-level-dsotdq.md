## Traits

***Bonus Proficiencies.*** Levna is proficient with simple and martial weapons, shields, and all armor.

***Pack Tactics.*** Levna has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of her allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

***Second Wind.*** Levna can use a bonus action on her turn to regain hit points equal to `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) + her level. Once she uses this feature, she can't use it again until she finishes a short or long rest.

***Improved Critical.*** Levna's attack rolls now score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`).

## Actions

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+3|noform|avg|text(10)` (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

## Reactions

***Protection.*** When a creature Levna can see within 5 feet of her is targeted by an attack, she can impose disadvantage on the attack roll if she can see the attacker and she is wielding a melee weapon.
