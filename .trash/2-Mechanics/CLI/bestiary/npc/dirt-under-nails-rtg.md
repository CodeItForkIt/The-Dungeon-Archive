## Traits

***Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a `dice:d10|noform|avg` (`d10`) to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.

***Regeneration.*** Dirt-Under-Nails regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he is in contact with the ground. If Dirt-Under-Nails takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Dirt-Under-Nails dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Shared Senses.*** Dirt-Under-Nails can see and hear what any plant within 120 ft can see and hear. In addition, Dirt-Under- Nails can communicate telepathically with any plant within this range.

***Special Equipment (+2 Rod of the Pact Keeper).*** While holding this [rod](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/2-rod-of-the-pact-keeper.md), Dirt-Under-Nails gains a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of his warlock spells (included in modifications, below). In addition, he can regain 1 warlock spell slot as an action while holding the rod. He can't use this property again until he finishes a long rest.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on each of its turns, Dirt-Under-Nails can use 10 feet of his movement to step magically into one copse of mushrooms within 5 feet of him and emerge from a second copse of mushrooms within 60 feet of it, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second copse. Both copses of mushrooms must be Large or bigger. Dirt-Under-Nails doesn't need to be able to see the second copse to use this ability.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The warlock's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells (spell save DC 15), requiring no material components:

**At will**: [alter self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md), [false life](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/false-life.md), [levitate](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md) (self only), [mage armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md) (self only), [silent image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silent-image.md)

**1/day each**: [feeblemind](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feeblemind.md), [finger of death](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death.md), [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md)

***Spellcasting.*** Dirt-Under-Nails is a 17th level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit with spell attacks). He regains his expended spell slots when he finishes a short or long rest. He knows the following warlock spells:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [chill touch](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chill-touch.md), [eldritch blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md), [friends](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/friends.md), [mage hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md), [prestidigitation](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md), [shocking grasp](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shocking-grasp.md)
