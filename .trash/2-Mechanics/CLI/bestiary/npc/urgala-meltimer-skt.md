# Urgala Meltimer
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 254*  

A retired adventurer, Urgala owns a respectable inn, the Northshield House, and she doesn't want to see it or her neighbors' homes destroyed. She has no tolerance for monsters or bullies.

Ideal:"We live in a violent world, and sometimes violence is necessary for survival."

Bond:"My home is my life. Threaten it, and I'll hurt you."

Flaw:"I know how treacherous and greedy adventurers can be. I don't trust them-any of them."
