## Traits

***Brave.*** Alagarthas has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

***Fey Ancestry.*** Alagarthas has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put him to sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Alagarthas makes two melee attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 bludgeoning damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, Alagarthas can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `dice:d4|noform|avg` (`d4`) to its roll provided it can hear and understand him. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Alagarthas is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).
