## Traits

***Angelic Weapons.*** Atash's weapon attacks are magical. When Atash hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Divine Awareness.*** Atash knows if it hears a lie.

***Magic Resistance.*** Atash has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Atash's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 25). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

**1/day each**: [commune](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md), [control weather](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather.md)

**3/day each**: [blade barrier](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blade-barrier.md), [dispel evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [resurrection](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resurrection.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Atash makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+15|noform|text(+15)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d6+8|noform|avg|text(22)` (`4d6 + 8`) slashing damage plus `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) radiant damage.

***Slaying Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+13|noform|text(+13)` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+6|noform|avg|text(15)` (`2d8 + 6`) piercing damage plus `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) radiant damage. If the target is a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die.

***Flying Sword.*** Atash releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If Atash can see the sword, Atash can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to Atash's hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, Atash is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if Atash dies.

***Healing Touch (4/Day).*** Atash touches another creature. The target magically regains `dice:8d8+4|noform|avg|text(40)` (`8d8 + 4`) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

## Legendary Actions

***Teleport.*** Atash magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Searing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).*** Atash emits magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10-foot radius must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d6|noform|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) fire damage plus `dice:4d6|noform|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).*** Atash targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until magic such as the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell removes the blindness.
