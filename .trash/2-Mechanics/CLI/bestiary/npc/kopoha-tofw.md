## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Kopoha fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Kopoha has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Kopoha's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Kopoha's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, `dice:1d20+15|noform|text(+15)` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md), [pass without trace](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [water breathing](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md), [water walk](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-walk.md)

**1/day each**: [commune](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md), [dispel evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [earthquake](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md), [fire storm](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fire-storm.md), [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `dice:1d20+15|noform|text(+15)` to hit, range 600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:7d6|noform|avg|text(24)` (`7d6`) damage of one of the following types (empyrean's choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Kopoha makes one attack.

***Bolster.*** Kopoha bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet of it until the end of its next turn. Bolstered creatures can't be [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of Kopoha's next turn.

***Trembling Strike (Costs 2 Actions).*** Kopoha strikes the ground with its maul, triggering an earth tremor. All other creatures on the ground within 60 feet of Kopoha must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
