## Traits

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature that can see Gloine's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of Gloine, Gloine can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if Gloine isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to glass and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). The [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the  [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other magic.

Unless [surprised](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised), a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Gloine until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Gloine in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If Gloine sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, Gloine is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.
