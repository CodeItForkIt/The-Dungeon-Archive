## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Nellik has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Nellik's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Nellik's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. Nellik can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [mirror image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mirror-image.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Nellik makes two melee attacks, or it makes one melee attack and teleports before or after the attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+5|noform|avg|text(12)` (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns due to a fiendish wound. Each time Nellik hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Medicine](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

***Greataxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d12+6|noform|avg|text(19)` (`2d12 + 6`) slashing damage; if the target is an Aberration, it takes an additional `dice:1d12|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d12`) slashing damage, and if it is grappling a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or its grapple ends.

***Teleport.*** Nellik magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
