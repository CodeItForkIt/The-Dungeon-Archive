# Thurstwell Vanthampur
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 34*  

Thurstwell is a pale and sullen recluse in his forties. A veritable shut-in, he uses imps to spy on his brothers, Amrik and Mortlock. Thurstwell resents both of them—Amrik for being their mother's favorite, and Mortlock for being a monstrous dolt.
