## Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** Josbert has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Josbert's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.

## Actions

***Electrified Mancatcher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d10+3|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d10 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d8`) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 13). Until the [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition ends, the target has the [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition and can't teleport, Josbert can't make Electrified Mancatcher attacks, and the target takes `dice:1d10+3|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d10 + 3`) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns.
