# Xan Moonblade
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 38*  

Xan is an elven bladesinger raised in the city of Evereska, one of the largest elven enclaves left in Faerûn, its population size second only to that of the island nation of Evermeet. With its name meaning "fortress home" in elvish, Evereska has remained hidden within the Western Heartlands for millennia. This secrecy is the major reason why the city remains as one of the last major elven enclaves in the North, whereas most others have fallen to outsiders. Because of this, Evereska is sometimes called the Last City.

Xan splits his time between his home city and the fortress library of Candlekeep. He originally encountered the monks of Candlekeep when he traveled with the Bhaalspawn, Abdel Adrian. Since then, he has found the library a comfortable second home with aims that are often aligned with that of Evereska.

Xan is one of the Blessed of Corellon and has changed gender many times over his life. His ability to change gender after an elven trance is something that he uses often, and it is usually his mercurial moods that will determine his choice.

Xan wields a moonblade forged by the smiths of Myth Drannor. Each moonblade is unique, with Xan's taking the form of a longsword wreathed in magical blue flames. Although such weapons are normally passed along elven bloodlines, Xan's sword appears specifically bound to him. Xan desires to eventually leave the mortal world and journey to Evermeet, but before he does that, he wants to find a worthy heir to his moonblade.

## Xan as a Contact

Xan is available as a contact at 9th level. Xan is able to give you access to the rarest books in Candlekeep. It is important to note that the cost of obtaining a Manual of Golems does not cover the cost of constructing the golem.
