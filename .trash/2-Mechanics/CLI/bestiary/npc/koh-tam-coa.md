# Koh Tam
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 265*  

Koh Tam is the powerful head priest of Kelemvor, god of death and the dead, at the Waterdeep cathedral. Seeking to know all the secrets of the realms of the dead, Koh Tam petitioned his god for permission to explore the Nine Hells. The young priest set forth into the infernal realm where he bore witness to horrors beyond mortal imagination and encountered fiendish creatures whose power greatly outmatched his own. The experience forever changed the priest. Rather than sate his curiosity, the journey only served to further incite Koh Tam's fascination with the infernal. He devoted himself to the study of arcane books concerning the subject and collected an impressive number of infernal relics.

In the many years since, the head priest has made several expeditions into the Nine Hells and has had many more encounters with fearsome devils. Koh Tam can thus be considered the expert authority on the infernal realm. He has advised many adventurers who seek to venture into the Nine Hells and has also prevented a fair number of foul creatures from fleeing that realm into mortal worlds. Though he remains devoted to the laws of Kelemvor, so much exposure to the infernal has changed Koh Tam in mind and body. The head priest has many habits and mannerisms that might seem strange to other mortals, and he has a unique perspective colored by his experience with the Nine Hells.
