# Mjenir
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 215*  

With grand events having been set in motion, those sensitive to prophecy have begun to experience dreams and visions. One such person is Mjenir, a fifty-year-old shaman of the Reghed Elk Tribe, who received a vision about the characters' journey to the Reghed Glacier.

Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.
