## Traits

***Divinely Blessed.*** Alyxian can't be [surprised](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised) and can't be changed into another form against his will.

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** Alyxian casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting modifier (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [guidance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md), [light](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [remove curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md), [water breathing](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-breathing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) radiant damage.

***Force Wave (1/Day).*** Alyxian strikes the ground, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward. Each creature he chooses within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on himself must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:10d6|noform|avg|text(35)` (`10d6`) force damage and be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Arch Heart's Strike.*** Alyxian makes one Spear attack, and all damage from this attack is radiant.

***Change Bringer's Dance.*** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Moon Weaver's Veil (Costs 2 Actions).*** Alyxian becomes [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the end of his next turn. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying becomes [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) with him.
