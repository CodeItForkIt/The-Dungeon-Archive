# Vanifer
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 203*  

Vanifer's rough childhood has hardened her heart against others. The world is a corrupt, painful place, she thinks, and deserving of a fiery end. For years, she was a dancer and concubine in a pasha's court in Calimshan. Later, she took up the mantle of prophet when she found Tinderstrike, and the same ruthless ambition and practiced manipulation that enabled her to escape a life of servitude serves her well as the head of a growing cult.

For Vanifer, battle is best observed at a distance. She prefers to hurl destructive magic from afar. Those who challenge Vanifer in melee learn a painful lesson, as she and Tinderstrike make a formidable pair.

In the Fire Node

When enemies threaten the Temple of Eternal Flame, Vanifer withdraws to the Weeping Colossus, the fire node. Within this node, Vanifer gains one additional use of her Legendary Resistance trait.
