## Traits

***5etools Note.*** While Galvan is not presented in an encounter in The Rise of Tiamat, the [dragonsoul](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/dragonsoul-rot.md) stat block has been provided here for ease of use, with optional alterations for the [Blue Dragon Mask](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/blue-dragon-mask-rotos.md).

***Special Equipment.*** Galvan has the [Blue Dragon Mask](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/blue-dragon-mask-rotos.md).

***Draconic Majesty.*** While wearing no armor and wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, Galvan adds his Charisma bonus to her AC (included).

***Lingering Shock.*** If Galvan deals lightning damage to a creature while wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, that creature can't take reactions until its next turn.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If Galvan fails a saving throw while wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Dragon Fanatic.*** Galvan has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). While Galvan can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, Galvan ignores the effects of being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if Galvan makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** Galvan can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** Galvan has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Galvan's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Galvan attacks twice with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+3|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) damage of the type to which Galvan has resistance.

***Orb of Dragon's Breath (3/Day).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, range 90 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) damage of the type to which Galvan has damage resistance.
