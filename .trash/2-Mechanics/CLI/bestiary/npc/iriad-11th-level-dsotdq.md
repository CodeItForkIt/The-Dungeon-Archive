## Traits

***Bonus Proficiencies.*** Iriad is proficient with simple weapons, light armor, [cartographer's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/cartographers-tools.md), and [woodcarver's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/woodcarvers-tools.md).

***Fey Ancestry.*** Iriad has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition on herself, and magic can't put her to sleep.

***Expertise.*** Iriad's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check she makes that uses either [Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth) or [Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival).

***Coordinated Strike.*** When Iriad uses her Helpful feature to aid an ally in attacking a creature, that target can be up to 30 feet away from her, and she can deal an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) damage to it the next time she hits it with an attack roll before the end of the current turn. The extra damage is the same type of damage dealt by the attack.

***Evasion.*** When Iriad is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if she fails. Iriad doesn't benefit from this feature while [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

***Inspiring Help.*** When Iriad takes the [Help](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Help) action, the creature who receives the help also gains a `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) bonus to the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`) roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

## Actions

***Poison Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+5|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d4 + 5`) piercing damage plus `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) poison damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Helpful.*** Iriad takes the [Help](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Help) action.

***Cunning Action.*** On Iriad's turn in combat, she can take the [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage), or [Hide](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action.
