# Lucretia Mathias
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 216*  

Lucretia Mathias is a willowy and wizened woman with piercing eyes and pursed lips. She is in her early nineties, and keeps her greying black hair in a coiled bun beneath a linen shawl. She wears simple grey robes, and clutches a heavy leather-bound tome. A glowing golden crystal dangles from a silver chain around her neck. Her garb lightly conceals the delerium shard embedded in her heart.

-     - **Personality Trait.** I speak in proverbs and quote scripture when I speak, inspiring others to interpret my cryptic words and come to their own revelations.    
-     - **Ideal.** The brightest lights shine in the darkest of places. None are beyond redemption, and all may find their inner truth and purpose by following the Falling Fire.    
-     - **Bond.** I have foreseen the inevitable end of our world, but through our sacred self-sacrifice we shall set alight the Sacred Flame to bring enlightenment and salvation to the universe.    
-     - **Flaw.** I only reveal the greatest truths I have seen to those I am certain can grasp them fully, and will understand them as I do.

## Traits

***Prescient.*** Lucretia Mathias can't be surprised while she is conscious.

***Unarmoured Defense.*** While Lucretia Mathias is wearing no armour and wielding no shield, her AC includes her Wisdom modifier.

***Undeniable Faith.*** Lucretia Mathias automatically succeeds on Constitution saving throws to maintain [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on her spells. Any spell she casts is treated as if it were cast using a 9th level spell slot, regardless of the spell slot used to cast the spell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Lucretia Mathias fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Divine Grace.*** Any creature who targets Lucretia Mathias with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This effect doesn't protect Lucretia Mathias from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

If Lucretia Mathias makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this effect ends until the start of her next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** Lucretia Mathias is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 20, `dice:1d20+12|noform|text(+12)` to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared:

The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) for 1 minute. This effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage.
