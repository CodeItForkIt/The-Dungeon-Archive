# Zariel
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 235*  

Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.

Zariel's rise came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.

## Zariel's Lair

Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets.

## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Zariel's darkvision.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zariel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Zariel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spellcasting.*** Zariel casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 26):

**At will**: [Alter Self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md) (can become Medium when changing her appearance), [Detect Evil and Good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [Fireball](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md), [Invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [Major Image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [Wall of Fire](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

**2/day each**: [Blade Barrier](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blade-barrier.md), [Dispel Evil and Good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [Finger of Death](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Zariel makes three Flail or Longsword attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Horrid Touch, if available.

***Flail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+16|noform|text(+16)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+8|noform|avg|text(17)` (`2d8 + 8`) force damage plus `dice:8d8|noform|avg|text(36)` (`8d8`) fire damage.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+16|noform|text(+16)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+8|noform|avg|text(17)` (`2d8 + 8`) radiant damage or `dice:2d10+8|noform|avg|text(19)` (`2d10 + 8`) radiant damage when used with two hands, plus `dice:8d8|noform|avg|text(36)` (`8d8`) fire damage.

***Horrid Touch (Recharge 5-6).*** Zariel touches one creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:8d10|noform|avg|text(44)` (`8d10`) necrotic damage and have the [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 minute. While [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the target has the [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) conditions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Teleport.*** Zariel magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

## Legendary Actions

***Teleport.*** Zariel uses Teleport.

***Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** Zariel turns her magical gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her and commands it to burn. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take `dice:4d10|noform|avg|text(22)` (`4d10`) fire damage.
