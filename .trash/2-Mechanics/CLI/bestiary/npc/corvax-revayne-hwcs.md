# Corvax Revayne
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 194*  

This slender dusk corvum's plumage resembles that of a black-billed magpie. A professor of divination at the Avium, his brilliant mind is often held back by paranoia, an unfortunate side-effect of the diviner's line of work. This has led faculty to view his predictions cautiously, and has earned him a reputation as a bit of an oddbird around campus. He is smart and capable, however, and can be a useful ally to the party in the last two parts of the adventure. Corvax shouldn't ever be in combat.
