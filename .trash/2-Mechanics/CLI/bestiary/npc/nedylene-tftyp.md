## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** Nedylene carries a [staff of swarming insects](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-of-swarming-insects.md).

***Fey Ancestry.*** Nedylene has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put Nedylene to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Nedylene has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

**Cantrips (at will)**: [guidance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md), [poison spray](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/poison-spray.md), [resistance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resistance.md), [spare the dying](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spare-the-dying.md), [thaumaturgy](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Nedylene makes two scourge attacks.

***Scourge +2.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus `dice:5d6|noform|avg|text(17)` (`5d6`) poison damage.

***Summon Demon (1/Day).*** Nedylene attempts to magically summon a [yochlol](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) with a 30 percent chance of success. If the attempt fails, Nedylene takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
