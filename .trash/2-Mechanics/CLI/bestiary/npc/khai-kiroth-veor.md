## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Khai's [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision).

***Magic Resistance.*** Khai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Khai makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, and it can use Frightful Presence or Incite Fanaticism.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+12|noform|text(+12)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d10+6|noform|avg|text(22)` (`3d10 + 6`) piercing damage plus `dice:7d10|noform|avg|text(38)` (`7d10`) fire damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+12|noform|text(+12)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d10+6|noform|avg|text(17)` (`2d10 + 6`) force damage plus `dice:2d10|noform|avg|text(11)` (`2d10`) fire damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Khai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of Khai must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Khai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Incite Fanaticism.*** Khai chooses up to four other creatures within 60 feet of it that can see it. Until the start of Khai's next turn, each of those creatures makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

***Power of the Dragon Queen.*** Khai targets one Dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The Dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to Khai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Khai for 1 hour. While [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the target regards Khai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if Khai or its companions deal damage to the target.
