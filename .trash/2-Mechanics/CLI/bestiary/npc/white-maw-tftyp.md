## Traits

***Amorphous Form.*** White Maw can occupy another creature's space and vice versa.

***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits White Maw corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. if its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits White Maw is destroyed after dealing damage.

White Maw can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While White Maw remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from white stone.

***Killer Response.*** Any creature that starts its turn in White Maw's space is targeted by a pseudopod attack if White Maw isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d8+4|noform|avg|text(22)` (`4d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) acid damage. If the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
