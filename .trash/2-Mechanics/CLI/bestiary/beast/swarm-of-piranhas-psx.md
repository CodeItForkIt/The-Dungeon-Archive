# Swarm of Piranhas
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 40*  

The waters of the Great River and all its tributaries are home to fish that serve as one of the most important food sources for other animals in the forest. These include large predatory fish, as well as churning swarms of small biting fish such as piranhas.

## Traits

***Blood Frenzy.*** The swarm has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny piranha. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Water Breathing.*** The swarm can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* `dice:4d6|noform|avg|text(14)` (`4d6`) piercing damage, or `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
