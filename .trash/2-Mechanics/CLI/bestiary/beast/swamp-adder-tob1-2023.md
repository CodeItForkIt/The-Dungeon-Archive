# Swamp Adder
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 334*  

*The vicious snake with a squat, diamond-shaped head, a puffed neck, and a peculiar yellow band around its body slithered slowly through the marsh.*

## Marsh Hunter

This venomous snake—sometimes known as the "speckled band"—is native to the marshes of southern realms, where it devours waterfowl and incautious halflings.

## Bred for Venom

The swamp adder is simultaneously feared and prized for its potent paralytic venom. A swamp adder is quite thin, and the largest weigh as much as 50 pounds. A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more in some markets.

## Traits

***Swamp Camouflage.*** The swamp adder has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) poison damage and is [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
