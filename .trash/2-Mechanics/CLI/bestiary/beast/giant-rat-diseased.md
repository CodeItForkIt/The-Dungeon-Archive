## Traits

***Keen Smell.*** The rat has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The rat has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the rat's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
