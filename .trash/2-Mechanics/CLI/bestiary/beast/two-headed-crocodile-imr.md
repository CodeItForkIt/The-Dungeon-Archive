## Traits

***Hold Breath.*** The two-headed crocodile can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

***Two Heads.*** The two-headed crocodile has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on saving throws against being [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), and knocked [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).

***Wakeful.*** When one of the crocodile's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The two-headed crocodile makes two attacks with its bite.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d10+2|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), and that head of the crocodile can't bite another target.
