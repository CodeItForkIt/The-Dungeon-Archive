## Traits

***Chameleon Carapace.*** The thri-kreen can change the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings. As a result, it has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.

***Standing Leap.*** The thri-kreen's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The thri-kreen's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. The thri-kreen can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [mage hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible))

**1/day**: [invisibility](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

**2/day each**: [blur](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blur.md), [magic weapon](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-weapon.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The thri-kreen makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|text(+3)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) while [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. The [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|text(+3)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d4+1|noform|avg|text(6)` (`2d4 + 1`) slashing damage.

***Weapons Multiattack.*** The thri-kreen makes two gythka attacks or two chatkcha attacks.

***Gythka.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|text(+3)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+1|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d8 + 1`) slashing damage.

***Chatkcha.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) slashing damage.
