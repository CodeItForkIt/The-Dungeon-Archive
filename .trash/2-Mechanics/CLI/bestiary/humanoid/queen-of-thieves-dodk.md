# Queen of Thieves
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 217*  

> [!quote] A quote from The Queen of Thieves.  
> 
> Who I am is not as important as what I am. I am quicker than thought, more silent than contemplation, more slippery than a fading memory, and more unshakable than a guilty conscience. I deal in secrets and mendacity as lesser thieves deal in coins and larceny. I can fulfil your wildest dreams, or I can be your worst nightmare.

The Queen of Thieves is a scheming mastermind who controls the Drakkenheim underworld. She has transformed a hundred squabbling bands of brigands and outlaws into a burgeoning criminal empire. However, none know her true identity or origin, for she wears many faces. Though she is most infamously encountered as a lithe masked woman garbed in swashbuckling attire with a wide-brimmed hat and jewelled rapier, the Queen of Thieves adopts a variety of costumes, facial features, skin and hair colours, body shapes, ages, and genders depending on her mood and circumstances. As such, she typically confirms her identity by revealing some secret about whoever she is speaking with or demonstrating her uncanny ability to change appearance seemingly at-will.

-     - **Personality Trait.** I am never caught unprepared, and have contingencies for my contingencies. I speak with rakish confidence while casually exposing everything I know about others, and flaunt my ability to be anybody or anywhere.    
-     - **Ideal.** I indulge in playing mind games and manipulating people with the promise of profit. Instead of spilling blood, I spill secrets. My enemies are worthless as corpses. When I have to steal lives, I spend them dearly first.    
-     - **Bond.** Law is powerless in the chaos of the ruins. As long as anarchy reigns, so shall I.    
-     - **Flaw.** Anyone who trusts me is a terrible fool. Double-crossing is my nature. I expect everyone to betray me, and I'll relish the opportunity to defeat them when they try.    

Few amongst the Queen's Men have met the Queen of Thieves in person, and even fewer have attended the Court of Thieves. Most only know if they get a note attached to a Queen of Diamonds playing card, you better do what it says.

## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** The Queen of Thieves wears an [amulet of proof against detection and location](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md) and a [spymaster's signet](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/spymasters-signet-dodk.md). She wields a [+3 rapier](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/3-weapon.md).

***Canny Defense.*** While the Queen of Thieves is wearing light or no armour and wielding no shield, her AC includes her Intelligence modifier.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The Queen of Thieves deals an extra 18 `dice:5d6|noform|avg` (`5d6`) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the Queen of Thieves that isn't incapacitated and she doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Queen of Thieves fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Memory Thief.*** Creatures are not aware when the Queen of Thieves reads their thoughts or charms them. Additionally, when a spell cast by the Queen of Thieves that causes creatures to become [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) ends, she can make the affected creatures lose their memories. They must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or forget up to 8 hours of the time spent [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by her. These memories can be restored with a [heal](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal.md) spell or similar magic.

## Reactions
