# Giff Shock Trooper
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 25, Light of Xaryxis*  

A giff shock trooper is trained to mount assaults on enemy strongholds. Each one is adept at softening up the enemy from a distance with firearms before charging into melee to mop up the foes that remain standing.

## Traits

***Firearms Knowledge.*** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

***Headfirst Charge.*** If the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line and ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

***Siege Monster.*** The giff deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giff makes two Greatsword or Musket attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+5|noform|avg|text(15)` (`3d6 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Musket.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d12+2|noform|avg|text(15)` (`2d12 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Thunder Bomb.*** The giff lights a grapefruit-sized bomb and throws it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:4d8|noform|avg|text(18)` (`4d8`) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the bomb, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`); on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more bombs to throw.
