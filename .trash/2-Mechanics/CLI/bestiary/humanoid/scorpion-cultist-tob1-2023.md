# Scorpion Cultist
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 411*  

Trained as part guardian and part assassin, the cultists of Selket are organized into cells that strike in the name of the Scorpion Goddess. The scorpion cultists watch for those who blaspheme the name of their goddess or defile her sacred places. Their enemies find themselves the target of poisoned blades or an apparent accident, while those who praise Selket or care for the desert nomads are quietly helped. On special missions, scorpion cultists might doff their traditional garb and infiltrate towns or cities.
