## Traits

***Firearms Knowledge.*** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

***Steady as She Goes.*** On the deck of a ship, the giff has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) or shove it overboard.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giff makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or `dice:1d10+4|noform|avg|text(9)` (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Musket.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d12+2|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d12 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Force Grenade.*** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:5d6|noform|avg|text(17)` (`5d6`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the grenade, roll a `dice:d6|noform|avg` (`d6`); on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more grenades to throw.
