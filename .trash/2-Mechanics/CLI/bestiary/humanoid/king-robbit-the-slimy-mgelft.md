## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Grumpy Grung Growl..*** A ferocious gurgling issues from the throat of the Dankwood grung, warning those within 15 feet that they are indeed grumpy. Creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) until the end of their next turn.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+0|noform|text(+0)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d4 + 1`) piercing damage in melee, or `dice:1d4+1|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d4 + 1`) piercing damage at range. Target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+6|noform|avg|text(9)` (`1d6 + 6`) piercing damage. Target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) poison damage.
