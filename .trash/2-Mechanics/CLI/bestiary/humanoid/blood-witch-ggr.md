# Blood Witch
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 248*  

Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between Rakdos and his cult-the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of Rakdos recognizes no authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.

Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.

## Traits

***Blood Witch Dance.*** The witch can use a bonus action to control the movement of one creature cursed by its [hex](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hex.md) spell that it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or use its reaction to move up to 30 feet in a direction of the witch's choice.
