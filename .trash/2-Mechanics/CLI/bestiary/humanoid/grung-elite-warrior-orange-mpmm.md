## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** A creature [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by a grung suffers an additional effect that depends on the grung's color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) by the grung. The [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) creature is [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of its allies.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+3|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+3|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:2d4|noform|avg|text(5)` (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Mesmerizing Chirr (Recharge 6).*** The grung makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each Humanoid or Beast that is within 15 feet of the grung and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) until the end of the grung's next turn.
