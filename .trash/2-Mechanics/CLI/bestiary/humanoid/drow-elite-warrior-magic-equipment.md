## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Special Equipment.*** The drow wears [+2 studded leather armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/drow-2-armor.md) and carries a [+2 shortsword](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/drow-2-weapon.md). These items lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***+2 Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+9|noform|text(+9)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+6|noform|avg|text(9)` (`1d6 + 6`) piercing damage plus `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) while [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
