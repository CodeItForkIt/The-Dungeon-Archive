# Emerald Order Cult Leader
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 410*  

The Emerald Order cult leader has embraced the mysteries of the Emerald Tablet and has bent its worship of Thoth-Hermes to furthering the efforts of the Order. The cult leader seeks to gather arcane and alchemical knowledge wherever it is found by any means necessary. If subtle manipulations fail, the cult leader is not above using lethal methods to ensure the cult's goals are met.

## Traits

***Blessed Weapons.*** The cult leader's weapons are blessed by its deity, and its weapon attacks are magical. When the cult leader hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Divine Blessing.*** While the cult leader is conscious and wearing no armor and wielding no shield, it adds its Wisdom modifier to its Armor Class (included above). In addition, it has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

***Prophetic Tactics.*** The cult leader has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, at the start of each of the cult leader's turns, one friendly creature within 30 feet of the cult leader has advantage on the first attack roll it makes before the start of the cult leader's next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** The Emerald Order cult leader casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [command](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/command.md), [light](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/light.md), [thaumaturgy](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1/day each**: [divination](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md), [freedom of movement](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/freedom-of-movement.md)

**3/day each**: [detect thoughts](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [dimension door](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md), [silence](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md), [slow](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/slow.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Emerald Order cult leader makes three Mace or Radiant Bolt attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Mace.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) radiant damage.

***Radiant Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d8+5|noform|avg|text(18)` (`3d8 + 5`) radiant damage.

## Reactions

***Esoteric Vengeance.*** When a creature the cult leader can see within 30 feet of it hits it with an attack, the cult leader intonates a mind-bending arcane secret, and the attacker takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) psychic damage.
