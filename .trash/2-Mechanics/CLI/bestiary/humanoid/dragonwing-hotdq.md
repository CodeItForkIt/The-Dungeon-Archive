## Traits

***Dragon Fanatic.*** The dragonwing has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened). While the dragonwing can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonwing ignores the effects of being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if the dragonwing makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** The dragonwing can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** The dragonwing has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonwing's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragonwing attacks twice with its scimitar.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+3|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d6 + 3`) slashing damage plus `dice:1d6|noform|avg|text(3)` (`1d6`) damage of the type to which the cultist has resistance.
