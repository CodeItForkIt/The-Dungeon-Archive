# One-Eyed Shiver
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 207*  

A one-eyed shiver is a fearsome cultist who wields powers of ice and cold. To gain the frigid power of elemental water, the shiver removes one eye and replaces it with a frosty white orb that can blast foes with an icy ray. When the orb isn't in use, the shiver covers its magical eye with an eye patch. Even when hidden, the orb's magical power makes itself felt-a one-eyed shiver has ice-cold blood and is constantly surrounded by an aura of thin, cold fog.

One-eyed shivers inspire dread and fear in all who meet them, including their fellow cultists. Only the leaders of the Crushing Wave cult dare to give commands to these masters of icy magic.

## Traits

***Chilling Mist.*** While it is alive, the one-eyed shiver projects an aura of cold mist within 10 feet of itself. If the one-eyed shiver deals damage to a creature in this area, the creature also takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) cold damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The one-eyed shiver is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, `dice:1d20+5|noform|text(+5)` to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following sorcerer spells:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [chill touch](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chill-touch.md), [mage hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [fog cloud](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md), [mage armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md), [thunderwave](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [mirror image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mirror-image.md), [misty step](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md)

**3rd level (2 slots)**: [fear](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md)

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Eye of Frost.*** The one-eyed shiver casts [ray of frost](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-frost.md) from its missing eye. If it hits, the target is also [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). A target [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) in this way can end the condition by using an action, succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.
