# Pale Man
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 212*  

Friedrich Von Lichten ambitiously explored the mutagenic effects of delerium after Drakkenheim's destruction, and was among the first to fully describe the effects of eldritch contamination upon the human body. He was ejected from the Amethyst Academy when it was discovered he was using apprentices as test subjects. So grave was his trespass, that the Academy notified the Silver Order of his existence, putting a death bounty on his head. Both The Silver Order and the Amethyst Academy have been searching for him since.

-     - **Personality Trait.** Witness my power, understand that I am the future. Some may call me a god, and I would not correct them.    
-     - **Ideal.** We must embrace the Haze, and allow contamination to change us, make us better.    
-     - **Bonds.** The Amethyst Academy lacks vision. I will show them the true power of delerium.    
-     - **Flaw.** It is not enough that I merely outsmart my foes, they must be shown their weakness and failure.    

Friedrich von Lichten has fully embraced contamination and transformed into a monster, and is now the Pale Man (see Appendix A of*Dungeons of Drakkenheim*for game statistics). He has maintained his intellect, and drapes his hunched and withered figure in a black cloak. Beneath his paper-thin skin are wriggling and writhing things. His lidless eyes are sunken, his teeth are prominent, yellowing and decaying. One can just make out a sickly green tongue that darts out when he speaks. He talks in a stunted, almost exasperated tone.

He presents his estate as a safehouse for the lost and forgotten.

The Pale Man sows the rumours that he can help contaminated people so he can use them as test subjects for his experiments. When he meets a transformed or contaminated creature, he presents himself as a helpful expert, offering to treat any individual left in his care. He never actually cures contamination, but sometimes helps other transformed monsters become somewhat lucid so he can make better use of them as minions. The Pale Man spends most of his time in the repurposed master bedroom of the estate he uses as his laboratory, and gives orders only to his most trusted thralls.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Pale Man fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Insect Body.*** The Pale Man can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the Pale Man can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect.
