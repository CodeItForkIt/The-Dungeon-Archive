## Traits

***Misty Camouflage.*** A delerium dreg has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to hide in any area obscured by mist or fog.

***Displacement.*** Attack rolls against a displaced dreg have disadvantage. If it is hit by an attack, this trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn. This trait is also disrupted while the displaced dreg is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) or has a speed of 0.

## Actions

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, or `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Teleport (Recharge 4-6).*** The displaced dreg magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Before or after teleporting, the dreg can make one melee attack. If this attack hits, it deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) psychic damage.
