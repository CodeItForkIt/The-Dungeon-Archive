## Traits

***Misty Camouflage.*** A delerium dreg has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to hide in any area obscured by mist or fog.

***Bounding Leap.*** The leeching dreg's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, or `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Blood Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:1d4+2|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage, and the dreg attaches to the target. While attached, the dreg can't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the dreg's turns, the target takes `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) necrotic damage.

The attached dreg moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the dreg's movement. The dreg can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the dreg.
