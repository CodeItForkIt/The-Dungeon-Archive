## Traits

***Misty Camouflage.*** A delerium dreg has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to hide in any area obscured by mist or fog.

***Death Burst.*** When a bloated delerium dreg dies, it explodes in a burst of corrupt offal. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures who fail their saving throw by 5 or more gain one level of contamination.

## Actions

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, or `dice:1d8+2|noform|avg|text(6)` (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Bile Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The bloated delerium dreg exhales a 15-foot cone of acid. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures who fail their saving throw by 5 or more gain one level of contamination.
