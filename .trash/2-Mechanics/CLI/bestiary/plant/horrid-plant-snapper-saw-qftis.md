## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the horrid plant is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the horrid plant move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check to discern that the horrid plant isn't an ordinary plant.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The horrid plant makes two Tendril attacks.

***Tendril.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 14), and the horrid plant can pull the target up to 25 feet closer to itself. Until the grapple ends, the target has the [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition, and the horrid plant can't use the same tendril on another target. The horrid plant has two tendrils.

## Bonus Actions

***Spiked Leaves.*** Creatures within 10 feet of the horrid plant and not behind total cover must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:6d6|noform|avg|text(21)` (`6d6`) slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
