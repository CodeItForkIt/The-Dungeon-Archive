# Ancient Deep Crow
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 211*  

So little is known of the deep crows that even less is known of their monstrous leviathan cousins, the ancient deep crows. Whether these gargantuan specimens are elder deep crows grown to great size or some higher form that holds lesser deep crows in thrall remains to be determined. Ideally by someone else. Seriously, stay away from these things.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The ancient deep crow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the ancient deep crow can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ancient deep crow makes three attacks: one with its mandibles and two with its claws.

***Mandibles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+11|noform|text(+11)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d10+6|noform|avg|text(17)` (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), and the ancient deep crow can't use its mandibles on another target.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+11|noform|text(+11)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+6|noform|avg|text(13)` (`2d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Shadow Caw.*** The ancient deep crow releases an ear-splitting caw. Each creature within 60 feet of the crow and able to hear it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) psychic damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** The deep crow makes a Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Shadow Caw (Costs 2 Actions).*** The ancient deep crow uses Shadow Caw.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The ancient deep crow beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the deep crow must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice:2d6+6|noform|avg|text(13)` (`2d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). The ancient deep crow can then fly up to half its flying speed.
