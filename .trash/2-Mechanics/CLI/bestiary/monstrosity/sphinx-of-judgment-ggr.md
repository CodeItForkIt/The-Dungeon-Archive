## Traits

***Inscrutable.*** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom ([Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks made to ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.
