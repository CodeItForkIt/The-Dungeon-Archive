## Traits

***Tunneler.*** The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+14|noform|text(+14)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:3d8+9|noform|avg|text(22)` (`3d8 + 9`) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes `dice:6d6|noform|avg|text(21)` (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

***Tail Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+14|noform|text(+14)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:3d6+9|noform|avg|text(19)` (`3d6 + 9`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking `dice:12d6|noform|avg|text(42)` (`12d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
