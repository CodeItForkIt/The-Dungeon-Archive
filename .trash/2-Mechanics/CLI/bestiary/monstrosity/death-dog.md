# Death Dog
*Source: Monster Manual p. 321, Storm King's Thunder, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, Light of Xaryxis, Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.

## Traits

***Two-Headed.*** The dog has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on saving throws against being [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or knocked [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dog makes two bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+2|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
