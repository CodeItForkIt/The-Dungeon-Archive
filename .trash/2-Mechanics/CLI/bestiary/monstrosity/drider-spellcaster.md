## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drider has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put the drider to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The drider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drider has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Walker.*** The drider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Spellcasting.*** The drider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit with spell attacks). The drider has the following spells prepared from the cleric spell list:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [poison spray](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/poison-spray.md), [thaumaturgy](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [bane](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane.md), [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [sanctuary](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sanctuary.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [hold person](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md), [silence](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md)

**3rd level (3 slots)**: [clairvoyance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/clairvoyance.md), [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md)

**4th level (2 slots)**: [divination](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md), [freedom of movement](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/freedom-of-movement.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drider makes three attacks, either with its longsword or its longbow. It can replace one of those attacks with a bite attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:1d4|noform|avg|text(2)` (`1d4`) piercing damage plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) poison damage.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+3|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or `dice:1d10+3|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+6|noform|text(+6)` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+3|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:1d8|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d8`) poison damage.
