# Shatter Corpse

## Salvage

The glass from ten shatter corpses can be used to create a suit of [glass-studded armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/glass-studded-armor-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) with a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check by someone proficient with jeweler's tools. Crafting this item takes 10 days and costs 1000 gp.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** Shatter corpses are a stronger kind of zombie that arises when someone dies from being impaled on broken glass.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([History](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)).** Those that attempt to use a melee attack against a shatter corpse are likely to cut themselves unless they attack with carefully.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Shatter corpses can launch volleys of broken glass.

## Traits

***Glass Spikes.*** Each time a creature makes a melee attack against a shatter corpse, it takes 3 piercing damage. A creature can choose to make an attack with disadvantage to avoid this damage.

***Loud.*** Creatures have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to hear the approach of a shatter corpse.

***Turn Resistance.*** The shatter corpse has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the shatter corpse to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the shatter corpse drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+3|noform|text(+3)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg|text(4)` (`1d6 + 1`) bludgeoning damage and `dice:1d4|noform|avg|text(2)` (`1d4`) piercing damage.

***Volley of Glass (Recharge 6).*** The shatter corpse flicks a volley of glass shards in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
