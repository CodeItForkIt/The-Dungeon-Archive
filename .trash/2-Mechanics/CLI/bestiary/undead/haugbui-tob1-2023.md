# Haugbui
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 231*  

*A thick swirl of dust rises, settles, and forms the vague outline of a human—two points of yellow light shine where its eyes should be, staring malevolently.*

## Mound Haunter

A haugbui is an undead spirit tied to its burial mound or barrow. It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight, sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income in the mound. A freshly-woken haugbui devours the remains of creatures it was buried with, such as a hawk, hound, or horse.

## Milder Spirits

Haugbuis are similar to vættir but much older. They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage, and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated and thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.

## Scrye and Watch

Haugbuis prefer to watch over their people from within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their mounds thanks to their scrying ability.

## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The haugbui can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg|text(5)` (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the haugbui has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Turn Resistance.*** The haugbui has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Nature.*** The hangbui doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Spellcasting.*** The haugbui casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will**: [dancing lights](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [mending](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mending.md), [purify food and drink](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md), [spare the dying](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spare-the-dying.md)

**1/day each**: [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [remove curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md)

**3/day each**: [gust of wind](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md), [telekinesis](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The haugbui makes three Psychic Blast attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Psychic Blast.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `dice:1d20+10|noform|text(+10)` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:5d8+5|noform|avg|text(27)` (`5d8 + 5`) psychic damage.

***Invisibility.*** The haugbui magically turns [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the haugbui wears or carries is [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) with it.

## Bonus Actions

***Sepulchral Scrying (Recharge 6).*** While within 1 mile of its burial mound, the haugbui creates an [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) sensor within 5 miles of the mound for 1 minute. When it uses this bonus action and as a bonus action on each of its turns for the duration, the haugbui can switch between using its own senses and projecting its senses through the sensor. While projecting its senses through the sensor, it can see, hear, telepathically communicate, and cast spells as if it was in the sensor's space, and it is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) with regard to its own senses. The sensor can be dispelled (DC 14).
