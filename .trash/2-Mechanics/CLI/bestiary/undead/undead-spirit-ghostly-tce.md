## Traits

***Incorporeal Passage.*** The spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spirit makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

***Deathly Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `YourSpellAttack` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `1d8 + 3` + the spell's level necrotic damage, and the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the undead until the end of the target's next turn.
