# Anointed
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 34*  

Not every citizen of Naktamun proves to be worthy of the afterlife. Acolytes sometimes die before the Ceremony of Measurement, perhaps in training accidents. Many [initiates](2-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/initiate-psa.md) perish in one of the first four trials, before earning their five cartouches. [Viziers](2-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/vizier-psa.md) sometimes die before they have truly earned a place in the afterlife serving their gods. Without having proven themselves worthy, these poor souls have no place as Eternals in the afterlife—but neither have they committed a grievous sin that would warrant abandoning them to the Curse of Wandering as marauding [mummies](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-psa.md).

Fortunately, the beneficence of the God-Pharaoh is great enough to provide a role for these people. Called the anointed, they are carefully embalmed, protected from the Curse of Wandering, and allowed to spend another lifetime in service to the worthy. The God-Pharaoh promises that those who faithfully serve as the anointed will earn a place as attendants in the afterlife as well, and even an eternity of service in the afterlife is prefera-ble to an eternity subjected to the Curse of Wandering.

The bodies of the anointed are carefully wrapped in cloth and adorned with cartouches. In contrast to the cartouches of [initiates](2-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/initiate-psa.md) and [viziers](2-Mechanics/CLI/backgrounds/vizier-psa.md), these do not harbor the life essence of the deceased at their best. Instead, they coach the anointed for a particular form of service. With their cartouches in place, the anointed rise and join the ranks of serving [mummies](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-psa.md) who attend to the needs of daily life in Amonkhet.

## The Curse of Wandering

The Curse of Wandering is the greatest danger of the desert lands. A creature killed in the desert rises again as a [zombie](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) as soon as the moisture has dried from its flesh. As a result, the corpses of every kind of desert creature shamble across the dunes alongside the humanoid [zombies](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) of dissenters and would-be explorers. Most of these former humanoids are mindless marauders, though some tales speak of [mummies](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-psa.md) that have retained a sinister intelligence and even magical ability, becoming [mummy lords](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-lord-psa.md).
