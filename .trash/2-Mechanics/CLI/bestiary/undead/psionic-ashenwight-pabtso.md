# Psionic Ashenwight
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 204*  

When an ashenwight arises near a crystal vein infused with aberrant power, or when one lingers in an area of fell magic, there is a chance for the ashenwight to develop psionic abilities. A psionic ashenwight is markedly more sapient than other ashenwights, though the resulting consciousness is a new creation separate from who the ashenwight was in life.

Some psionic ashenwights dedicate their existence to piecing together their previous life, while others strive to enlighten other ashenwights to this new psionic power.

## Ashenwights

When a Humanoid consumed by cruelty and rage dies in an area corrupted by the Far Realm, the creature sometimes rises as an ashenwight. The skin of these Undead horrors is desiccated, and their eyes often glow with otherworldly power.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The ashenwight casts one of the following spells, requiring no spellcasting components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At will**: [mage hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible)

**1/day**: [calm emotions](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/calm-emotions.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ashenwight makes two Necrotic Shard attacks. It also uses Psionic Crown if available.

***Necrotic Shard.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

***Psionic Crown (Recharge 5-6).*** The ashenwight wreathes the head of a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself with a crown of jagged, spectral crystals. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition for 1 minute. While [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the target's thoughts are sluggish; it can't take reactions, its speed is halved, and it takes `dice:2d8|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d8`) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
