# Greater Zombie
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 237, Divine Contention, Sleeping Dragon's Wake, Infernal Machine Rebuild*  

Many of those who brave the Tomb of Horrors believe they have reached their ultimate destination when they disturb a skeletal figure inside a secluded crypt. It is, in fact, a greater zombie, a creature magically created from a humanoid corpse to be far more resilient than a typical zombie.

## Undead Nature

A zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Turn Resistance.*** The zombie has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie makes two melee attacks.

***Empowered Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage and `dice:2d6|noform|avg|text(7)` (`2d6`) necrotic damage.
