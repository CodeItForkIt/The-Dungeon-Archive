## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The shadow can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the shadow can take the Hide action as a bonus action. Its stealth bonus is also improved to +6.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the shadow has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

***Strength Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+4|noform|text(+4)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+2|noform|avg|text(9)` (`2d6 + 2`) necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`). The target falls [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) if this reduces its Strength to 0. The creature regains consciousness and the reduction to its Strength score disappears after it finishes a short or long rest.
