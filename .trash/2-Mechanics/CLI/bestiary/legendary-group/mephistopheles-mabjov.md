# Mephistopheles

## Lair actions
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mephistopheles can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Mephistopheles can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Mephistopheles casts any spell from his wizard list and if it normally requires [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- Mephistopheles covers a 5-foot area with Hellfire. Any creature that starts their turn on that area suffers `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) fire damage. The Hellfire remains until Mephistopheles dismisses it or he uses this ability again.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

The region containing Mephistopheles's lair is corrupted by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Flaming winds scour the area within 2 miles of Mephistopheles's lair. Any creature with vulnerability to fire damage suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) for every hour spent this close to the lair.  
- Within 2 miles of Mephistopheles's lair, every 60 feet of movement results in a flame geyser erupting. When a geyser appears, the creature that triggered its appearance and fails a Dexterity 22 saving throw suffers `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) fire damage. Damage is halved if the saving throw is successful. The geyser remains for a day.  

If Mephistopheles dies, the effects fade over the course of `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) days.
