# Jotun
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 209*  

*The earth shudders with every footfall of this massive giant.*

## Foes of the Gods

Tall enough to look a titan in the eye and strong enough to wrestle a dragon, jotun giants are the lords of giantkind and the immortal enemies of the gods. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and glaciers throughout the north. As foes of the northern gods, jotun giants plot to regain their former status as lords of creation. Many know ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and the most powerful among them straddle the line between mortal and demigod.

## Contests and Challenges

Like many giants, jotun enjoy a challenge. Only the mightiest heroes can challenge a jotun's might in physical combat, and most resort to cunning or trickery to defeat a jotun. However, jotun giants are no fools and catch on to trickery quickly.

## Traits

***Demigod's Vitality.*** The jotun's ability scores and hp maximum can't be reduced except by means of a [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.

***Icy Weapons.*** The jotun's weapon attacks are magical. When the jotun hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `dice:6d8|noform|avg` (`6d8`) cold damage (included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The jotun has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Material Bound.*** The jotun is immune to any spell or effect that would force it to leave the Material Plane, unless the jotun wants to leave. It has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would return it to the Material Plane from another plane of existence.

***Too Big to Notice.*** While the jotun remains motionless in nonmagical, natural terrain, it has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.

***Spellcasting.*** The jotun casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):

**At will**: [earthquake](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake.md), [speak with animals](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals.md)

**1/day**: [divination](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/divination.md)

**3/day**: [bestow curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bestow-curse.md), [gust of wind](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The jotun can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three Greatclub or Rock attacks.

***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+17|noform|text(+17)` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d8+10|noform|avg|text(28)` (`4d8 + 10`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) cold damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+17|noform|text(+17)` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:4d10+10|noform|avg|text(32)` (`4d10 + 10`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:6d8|noform|avg|text(27)` (`6d8`) cold damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the jotun's choice within 120 feet of the jotun and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the jotun's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Icy Sweep (Recharge 5-6).*** The jotun swings its ice-coated greatclub in a wide arc. Each creature within 20 feet of the jotun must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `dice:8d8|noform|avg|text(36)` (`8d8`) bludgeoning damage and `dice:12d8|noform|avg|text(54)` (`12d8`) cold damage and is pushed up to 15 feet away from the jotun and knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).

## Reactions

***Rock Catching.*** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the jotun, the jotun can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
