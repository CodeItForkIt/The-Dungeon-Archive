# Lunar Devil
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 98*  

*A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror painted in mist and moonlight.*

## Corruptors of the Moon

Lunar devils can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werewolves. They are a lazy breed of devil and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers, pitting them against followers of sun gods.

## Vain and Boastful

Lunar devils are as vain as they are indolent. Tales the fey tell involve thwarting them by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils frequently befriend the dark fey.

## Flying in Darkness

In combat, lunar devils sometimes bring allies along, bestowing magical flight on them. The devils stay in areas of moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils have excellent vision in total darkness, though, and are happy to use that against foes. They prefer attacking from range, allowing allies to take the brunt of any opposition.

***Magic Resistance.*** The lunar devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The lunar devil casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

**At will**: [fly](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [major image](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md)
