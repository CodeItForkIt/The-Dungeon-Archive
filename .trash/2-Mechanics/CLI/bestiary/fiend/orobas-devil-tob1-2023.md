# Orobas Devil
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 99*  

*Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with well-chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and hoofed feet.*

Orobas devils thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who have the coin or souls. The common phrase, "never trust a gift horse," stems from these corrupting devils.

## Horse-Headed but Wise

Orobas devils look like horrific horse-headed humans. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils, and flames dance across their flails. This beast-like appearance belies their true strength; these devils possess an uncanny prescience and affinity for divination.

## Masters of Deceit

When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfullyâ€”or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile.

## Surrounded by Lessers

Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces.

## Traits

***Deceptive Advice.*** When the orobas casts a spell of the divination school, it has advantage on Charisma ([Deception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks for 1 minute.

***Hellish Weapons.*** The orobas's weapon attacks are magical. When the orobas hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `dice:3d8|noform|avg` (`3d8`) fire damage (included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The orobas has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Sense Consecrated.*** The orobas can pinpoint the location of Celestials, consecrated places or objects, and creatures wielding divine or celestial power, such as clerics, paladins, or aasimars, within 60 feet of it.

***Spellcasting.*** The orobas casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will**: [augury](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md), [detect thoughts](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [guidance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md)

**1/day each**: [contact other plane](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contact-other-plane.md) (as an action), [legend lore](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/legend-lore.md) (as an action)

**3/day each**: [locate creature](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-creature.md), [nondetection](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The orobas makes one Bite attack, one Flail attack, and one Stomp attack, or it makes four Hurl Flame attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+13|noform|text(+13)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d6+8|noform|avg|text(15)` (`2d6 + 8`) piercing damage plus `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) fire damage and `dice:3d6|noform|avg|text(10)` (`3d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Flail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+13|noform|text(+13)` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:2d8+8|noform|avg|text(17)` (`2d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) fire damage.
