## Traits

***Hellish Weapons.*** The erinyes's weapon attacks are magical and deal an extra `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) poison damage on a hit (included in the attacks).

***Magic Resistance.*** The erinyes has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Special Equipment.*** The erinyes carries a [rope of entanglement](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/rope-of-entanglement.md).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The erinyes makes three attacks. It can use its [rope of entanglement](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/rope-of-entanglement.md) in place of two of the attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+8|noform|text(+8)` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+4|noform|avg|text(8)` (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or `dice:1d10+4|noform|avg|text(9)` (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) poison damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `dice:1d20+7|noform|text(+7)` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* `dice:1d8+3|noform|avg|text(7)` (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus `dice:3d8|noform|avg|text(13)` (`3d8`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). The poison lasts until it is removed by the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The erinyes adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the erinyes must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
