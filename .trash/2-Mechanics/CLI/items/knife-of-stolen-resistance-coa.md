# Knife of Stolen Resistance
*Weapon ([dagger](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md)), rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

Using an action, you carve a single infernal rune into the flesh of an [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) Beast, Celestial, Dragon, Fey, or Giant with this knife. Over the next 10 minutes the creature dies an agonizing death that can't be prevented short of the [Wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell. If the creature has any resistances or immunities, you gain those resistances and immunities until the creature dies or a [Wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell is used to save the creature. The knife's power can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
