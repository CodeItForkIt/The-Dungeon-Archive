# Kiss of the Changebringer (Awakened)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)

A beautiful, glittering emerald is set within this silver chain, humming with power and possibility. It is said that this amulet was stolen from the neck of The Changebringer herself by the The Lord of the Hells, and locked within the vaults of Bazzoxan in "Wildemount". It was later claimed there by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers during an expedition into that grim fortress's abandoned temples.

## Dormant

While the Kiss of the Changebringer is in a dormant state, you have a +1 bonus to saving throws and are immune to the [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition while wearing it.

## Awakened

When the Kiss of the Changebringer reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The bonus to saving throws increases to +2.  
- You are immune to the [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.  
- You can use an action to cast the [blink](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blink.md) spell on yourself. This property of the amulet can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
