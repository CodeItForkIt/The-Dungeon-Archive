# Suude
*Illegal drug*  


Exandria's most infamous drug, [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) is a glittering powder made from "residuum". It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the "Age of Arcanum" as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the "Calamity", and many different types of [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.

After burning [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take `dice:4d10|noform|avg|text(22)` (`4d10`) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour and fall [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colors—yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md), or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.

On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md), and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale [suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-tdcsr.md) again.

[Brown suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-brown-tdcsr.md) allows you to use the [Extended Spell](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/extended-spell.md) Metamagic option, [blue suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-blue-tdcsr.md) allows you to use [Twinned Spell](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/twinned-spell.md), and [red suude](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/suude-brown-tdcsr.md) grants [Distant Spell](2-Mechanics/CLI/optional-features/distant-spell.md).
