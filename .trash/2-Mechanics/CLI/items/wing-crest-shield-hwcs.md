# Wing Crest Shield

While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.

As an action, you can speak the command word to cast [gust of wind](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind.md) (save DC 15). Once the shield has been used to cast this spell, it can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn.
