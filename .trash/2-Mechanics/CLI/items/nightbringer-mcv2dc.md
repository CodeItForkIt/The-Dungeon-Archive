# Nightbringer
*Weapon ([mace](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/mace.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This heavy mace has a dark oaken handle and a head of blackened steel trimmed with gold. In combat, the mace's head is wreathed in inky black energy.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an additional `dice:4d4|noform|avg` (`4d4`) radiant damage.

If you have an evil alignment, you also gain the following benefits when attuned to Nightbringer:

## Blessing of the Dragon Queen

You are immune to the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions, and you gain immunity to one of the following damage types (choose when you attune to the weapon): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

## Eyes of Midnight

You have [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet.

## Midnight Shroud

The weapon has 6 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can expend one charge to force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until the start of your next turn. The weapon regains `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) expended charges daily at dawn.
