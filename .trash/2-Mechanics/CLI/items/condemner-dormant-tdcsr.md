# Condemner (Dormant)
*Weapon ([heavy crossbow](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/heavy-crossbow.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Range**: 100/400
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Heavy](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Loading](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Loading), [Two-Handed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed), [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)

This shadow-touched [heavy crossbow](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/heavy-crossbow.md) once served as the weapon of choice for the legendary assassin Todora. Though few know this, Condemner is now in the possession of an equally infamous assassin named "Ixrattu Khar".

## Dormant

When Condemner is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) poison damage.

Additionally, if you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can activate one of the following effects instead of dealing damage:

- You cast [fog cloud](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md) centered on the target's space.  
- You cast [silence](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md) centered on the target's space.  

When an effect is used, it can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest.
