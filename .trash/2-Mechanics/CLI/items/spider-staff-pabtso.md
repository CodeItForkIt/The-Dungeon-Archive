# Spider Staff
*Staff, weapon, rare (requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

The top of this magic quarterstaff is shaped like a spider. It deals an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

## Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [spider climb](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/spider-climb.md) (1 charge) or [web](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/web.md) (2 charges; spell save DC 15).

The staff regains `dice:1d6+4|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 4`) expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
