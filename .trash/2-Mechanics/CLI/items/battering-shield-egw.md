# Battering Shield
*Armor ([shield](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this iron tower shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

Additionally, the shield has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you are holding the shield and push a creature within your reach at least 5 feet away, you can expend 1 charge to push that creature an additional 10 feet, knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), or both.
