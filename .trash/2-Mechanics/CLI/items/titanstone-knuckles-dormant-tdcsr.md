# Titanstone Knuckles (Dormant)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)

Carved from the heartstone of a slain earth primordial, these gauntlets bestow immeasurable might to their wearer. In recent times, they were wielded by the legendary barbarian [Grog Strongjaw](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/grog-strongjaw-tdcsr.md), who continues to use them as he seeks worthy challengers across Tal'Dorei and Exandria.

## Dormant

While the Titanstone Knuckles are in a dormant state, your Strength score becomes 22 while you wear these gauntlets. Additionally, your weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures.
