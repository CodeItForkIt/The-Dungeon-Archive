# Whisper Jar
*Wondrous item (requires attunement)*  


Also at rank 1, you are the beneficiary of a whisper jarâ€”a common magic item resembling an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others' stories and your own observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The whisper jar records as fast as a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded. Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.

## Whispered Encyclopedia

At rank 2, your whisper jar becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#History)) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Whispered Warnings

Also at rank 3, your whisper jar gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As an action, you can cause the jar to function as a [wand of enemy detection](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/wand-of-enemy-detection.md), whereupon it whispers the direction to foes within range. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Whispered Arcana

Also at rank 4, your whisper jar gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar: [detect evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect poison and disease](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md), [find traps](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-traps.md), [identify](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md), or [locate animals or plants](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/locate-animals-or-plants.md). This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.
