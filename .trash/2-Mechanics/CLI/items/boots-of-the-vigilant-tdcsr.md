# Boots of the Vigilant
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  


While you wear these boots, you can sense impending danger. After you roll initiative, you can choose to roll a `dice:d8|noform|avg` (`d8`) and add it to your initiative roll. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
