# Ranseur of Torture
*Weapon ([pike](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/pike.md)), artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d10 P
- **Properties**: [Heavy](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Reach](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Reach), [Two-Handed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 18.0 lbs.

Forged of infernal iron and Hellfire through the help of Dispater, the Ranseur of Torture has been Belial's weapon of choice since he first became an archdevil.

It is so directly tied to him that one of his worshipped symbols is a two-pronged fork. The weapon never leaves his side, and he is a master at wielding it.

The Ranseur of Torture is a magic pike. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) piercing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) necrotic damage.

## Random Properties

The Ranseur of Torture has the following random properties:

- 1 [minor beneficial](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property  
- 1 [major beneficial](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property  
- 1 [minor detrimental](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property  

## Wounding

Damage dealt by the Ranseur of Torture is particularly dangerous, as it can only be restored through magical means. Resting, food, and medicine won't restore hit points removed by the pike. If the damage goes untreated for 7 days, the missing hit points are permanently removed, and can be recovered only through casting a [Regenerate](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/regenerate.md) or [Wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the victim.

## Execution

If a creature with less than its full hit points is hit by this pike, the Ranseur of Torture deals `dice:1d10|noform|avg` (`1d10`) additional piercing damage. If a creature is killed by the pike, their soul is sent to Phlegethos and can be restored only through casting a [Wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell on the victim.

## Staggered

Each time a creature takes damage from the Ranseur of Torture, they must make a Constitution save, with a DC equaling the damage they took. On a failed save, their movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This penalty stacks, though movement speed can't be reduced below 0.

## Interrupting

Spellcasters damaged by the Ranseur of Torture have disadvantage on Constitution checks made to maintain [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) until the damage is healed. If a creature is concentrating on a spell when damaged by the ranseur, their [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) is immediately ended.

## Destroying the Ranseur

Only through the written consent of both Dispater and Belial can the Ranseur of Torture be destroyed. If either or both of the archdevils are dead, then the new archdevil to take their mantle must give permission in their stead. The two writs must be wrapped around each of the prongs of the weapon, then the weapon must be tossed into the Pit of Flame. If performed successfully, the Hellfire briefly burns a different hue.
