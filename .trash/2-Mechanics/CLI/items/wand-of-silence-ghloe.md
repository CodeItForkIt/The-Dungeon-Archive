# Wand of Silence
*Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the [silence](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/silence.md) spell (save DC 15). The wand regains `dice:1d6+1|noform|avg` (`1d6 + 1`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
