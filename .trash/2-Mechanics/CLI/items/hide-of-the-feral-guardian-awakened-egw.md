# Hide of the Feral Guardian (Awakened)
*Light armor ([studded leather armor](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/studded-leather-armor.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Properties**: [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melora, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

## Dormant

While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor grants you a +1 bonus to AC.  
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, you have a +1 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls, and you retain the benefits of this armor.  
- As an action, you can use the armor to cast [polymorph](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md) on yourself, transforming into a [giant owl](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md) while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  

## Awakened

When the armor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The AC bonus of the armor increases to +2.  
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, your bonus to melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (to +2).  
- When you cast the [polymorph](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md) spell using this armor, you can transform into a [cave bear](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/cave-bear.md).
