# Staff of Contaminated Power
*Staff, weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 1 charge each hour it rests in the Deep Haze. You can also touch a delerium crystal to the staff, which causes it to regain `dice:2d8+4|noform|avg` (`2d8 + 4`) charges, then the crystal crumbles to dust. If you expend the last charge, you immediately gain `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) levels of contamination.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: [delerium orb](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/delerium-orb-dodk.md) (1 charge), [warp bolt](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/warp-bolt-dodk.md) (2 charges), [ride the rifts](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ride-the-rifts-dodk.md) (3 charges), [delerium blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/delerium-blast-dodk.md) (4 charges), [conjure the deep haze](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-the-deep-haze-dodk.md) (5 charges), and [ray of contamination](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-contamination-dodk.md) (6 charges). You don't gain any contamination levels when you cast these spells using charges from this staff.
