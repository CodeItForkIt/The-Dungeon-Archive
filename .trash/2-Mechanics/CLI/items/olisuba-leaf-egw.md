# Olisuba Leaf
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 50 gp

These dried leaves of the Olisuba tree, when steeped to make a tea, can help a body recover from strenuous activity. If you drink a dose of Olisuba tea during a long rest, your [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level is reduced by 2 instead of 1 at the end of that long rest.
