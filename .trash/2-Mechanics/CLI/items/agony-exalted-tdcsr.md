# Agony (Exalted)
*Weapon ([flail](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/flail.md)), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of non-good alignment)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Utilized in countless tortures and slow executions, the hooked chains of this brutal weapon constantly show dried blood and rot. Legend says that Agony was wielded in the "Calamity" by the gnoll scion of a flesh-eating Demon Lord.

## Dormant

While Agony is in a dormant state, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you damage a creature with Agony, that creature is marked for 10 minutes or until you damage a different creature. When you hit a creature marked in this way with this weapon, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) piercing damage.

## Awakened

When Agony reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The extra damage when you hit a marked creature increases to `dice:1d8|noform|avg` (`1d8`).  
- A marked creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.  
- When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using Agony, you can immediately make an additional melee attack with this weapon as a bonus action.  

## Exalted

When Agony reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +3.  
- The extra damage when you hit a marked creature increases to `dice:2d8|noform|avg` (`2d8`).  
- When you score a critical hit with this weapon, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. On a success, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
