# Red Wizard Blade
*Weapon ([dagger](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md)), legendary*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)

Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra `dice:3d12|noform|avg` (`3d12`) necrotic damage.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and can't be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a [tablet of reawakening](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/tablet-of-reawakening-hat-lmi.md) to cast the [true resurrection](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell.
