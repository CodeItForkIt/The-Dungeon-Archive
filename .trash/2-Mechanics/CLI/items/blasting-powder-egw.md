# Blasting Powder
*Adventuring gear*  


This volatile alchemical powder comes in a small pouch. When ignited by an open flame or a fuse, the powder explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding pouch must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `dice:3d6|noform|avg` (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character can bind multiple pouches of blasting powder together so they explode at the same time. Each additional pouch increases the damage by `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) (maximum of `dice:10d6|noform|avg` (`10d6`)) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum of 20 feet).
