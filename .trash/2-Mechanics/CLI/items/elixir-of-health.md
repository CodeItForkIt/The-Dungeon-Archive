# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  


When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [paralyzed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), and [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
