# Whisper (Awakened)
*Weapon ([dagger](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown), [Vestige of Divergence](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige%20of%20Divergence)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by [Vax'ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md). Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.

## Dormant

While Whisper is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Additionally, when you score a critical hit with this dagger, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of you for 1 minute. On a success, the target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

## Awakened

When Whisper reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2. Additionally, when you hit with an attack using this dagger, the target takes an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) psychic damage.  
- The DC to resist being [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) from a critical hit increases to 15.
