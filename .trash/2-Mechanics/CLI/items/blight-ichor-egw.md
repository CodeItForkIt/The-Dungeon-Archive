# Blight Ichor
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 200 gp

This bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks, as well as vulnerability to psychic damage, for 1 hour. For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) hours and suffer the effects of a [confusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell for 1 minute. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all Dexterity checks and is immune to the [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for 1 hour.
