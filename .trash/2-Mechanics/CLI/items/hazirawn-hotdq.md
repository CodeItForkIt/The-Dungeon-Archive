# Hazirawn
*Weapon ([greatsword](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/greatsword.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, Hazirawn is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you are not attuned to Hazirawn, you deal an extra `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`) necrotic damage when you hit with the weapon.

## Increased Potency

While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra `dice:2d6|noform|avg` (`2d6`) necrotic damage (instead of `dice:1d6|noform|avg` (`1d6`)).

## Spells

Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) (1 charge), [detect evil and good](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) (1 charge), or [detect thoughts](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md) (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) expended charges.

## Wounding

While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success.
