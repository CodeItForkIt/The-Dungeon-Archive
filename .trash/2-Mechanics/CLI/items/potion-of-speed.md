# Potion of Speed
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [haste](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/haste.md) spell for 1 minute (no [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required). The potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
