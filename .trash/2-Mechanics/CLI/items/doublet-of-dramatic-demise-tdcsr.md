# Doublet of Dramatic Demise
*Wondrous item, common*  


This striking satin jacket allows you to make the most of your dying moments. When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this doublet, you do not fall [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious). Instead, you are [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and your speed becomes 0, but you can speak and communicate.

You make death saving throws as normal, but if you roll a 1 on the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`), you swoon with a loud gasp and die instantly.
