# Witherbloom Primer
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


The Witherbloom Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Witherbloom College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains `dice:1d3|noform|avg` (`1d3`) expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a `dice:1d4|noform|avg` (`1d4`) bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the `dice:d20|noform|avg` (`d20`).

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the druid or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
