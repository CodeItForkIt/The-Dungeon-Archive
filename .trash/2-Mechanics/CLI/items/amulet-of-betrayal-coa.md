# Amulet of Betrayal
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


You can use a bonus action to move one of the following conditions from yourself to an ally within 60 feet of you: [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened), [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion). When transferring [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion), move all your [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) levels. If the chosen ally is immune to a transferred condition, the transfer fails.
