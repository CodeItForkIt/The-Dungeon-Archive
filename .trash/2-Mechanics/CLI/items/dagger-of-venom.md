# Dagger of Venom
*Weapon ([dagger](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger.md)), major, rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `dice:2d10|noform|avg` (`2d10`) poison damage and become [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
