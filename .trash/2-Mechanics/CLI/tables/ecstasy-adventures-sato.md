**Ecstasy Adventures**

`dice: [](ecstasy-adventures-sato.md#^ecstasy-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A convincing petitioner (chaotic neutral [ghost](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md)) pretends to be the long-lost relative of a character. The spirit aims to possess the character and live life to the fullest. |
| 2 | The Lightcaller holds a peace banquet in "Solrise Tower", inviting powerful devils and demons in hopes of ending the Blood War. A [solar](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/solar.md) requests the characters attend in case things turn ugly. |
| 3 | A [green hag](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) poisons Ecstasy's orchards daily at twilight, outside the jurisdiction of either monarch. After a string of illnesses at "Revelhome", Madame Millani hires the characters to investigate. |
| 4 | Three evenings have passed since the gates of "Moondark Tower" last opened. An owl-like [avoral guardinal](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/avoral-guardinal-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") night merchant asks the party to solve the mystery. |
