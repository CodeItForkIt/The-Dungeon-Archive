**Sigil Lower Ward Encounters**

`dice: [](sigil-lower-ward-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-lower-ward-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A thunder-voiced [Mind's Eye matter smith](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/minds-eye-matter-smith-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") admonishes passersby to realize the power inside themselves. As a demonstration, the matter smith reshapes material around one of the characters. |
| 2 | Two [wererats](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) in human form approach the characters, offering to sell them various junkyard baubles, while a third wererat uses the distraction to pick a character's pocket. |
| 3 | A [bariaur wanderer](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/bariaur-wanderer-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") wearing a gold monocle and an embroidered vest asks the characters to pick up an order for him at a nearby pawnshop. He offers to pay them 10 gp for their trouble (and their discretion). |
| 4 | Two [minotaur](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) smiths argue with a [goristro](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/goristro.md) over the price of an expertly forged greataxe, turning to the characters to settle the debate. |
| 5 | An [Athar null](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/athar-null-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") warmly greets the characters and offers to show them to their destination—while subtly pitching Athar philosophy to them. |
| 6 | The [ghost](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of a factory worker appears to the characters and asks them to retrieve its skull from the "Bones of the Night" (see the ""Lower Ward Locations"" section) so it can finally be laid to rest. |
| 7 | Two [githzerai monks](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/githzerai-monk.md) approach the characters, searching for a dangerous [blue slaad](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/blue-slaad.md) that stole a mote of primordial chaos from the "Face of Gith" tavern (see the ""Lower Ward Locations"" section). |
| 8 | A soot-stained goblin [mage](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) uses fire magic to repair a damaged [iron golem](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) in the street. She tells the characters she needs two hundred pounds of iron to replace the construct's missing arm—even scrap will do. |
