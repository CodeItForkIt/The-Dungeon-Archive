| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters encounter `dice:1d4+1\\|noform\\|avg` (`1d4 + 1`) [mammoths](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md) being hunted by `dice:2d6\\|noform\\|avg` (`2d6`) wildfolk [scouts](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). |
| 2 | An [abominable yeti](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/abominable-yeti.md) and `dice:1d4\\|noform\\|avg` (`1d4`) [yetis](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yeti.md) stalk the characters. |
| 3 | The characters encounter `dice:2d4\\|noform\\|avg` (`2d4`) [yetis from Allowak's Sanctuary](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/allowak-yeti-egw.md) (see ""Allowak's Sanctuary Yeti Statistics"" later in this chapter). The yetis attempt to scare the characters away but do not wish to do harm. |

If the characters scare the elk, `dice:1d6\\|noform\\|avg` (`1d6`) [elk](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/elk.md) attack while the rest of the herd flees. During the combat, a [remorhaz](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) bursts out of the snow and attacks indiscriminately. |
