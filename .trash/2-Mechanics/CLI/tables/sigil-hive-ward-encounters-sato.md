**Sigil Hive Ward Encounters**

`dice: [](sigil-hive-ward-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-hive-ward-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [Hands of Havoc fire starter](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/hands-of-havoc-fire-starter-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"), flame in hand and a wild look in their eyes, stands outside an abandoned building. "Care to help?" they ask the characters. |
| 2 | A [kelubar demodand](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/kelubar-demodand-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") street food vendor pushes a rusty cart down a nearby alley. Charred, sausage-link manacles dangle from the cart's torn awning. The demodand offers the characters anything on the cart for 5 cp. |
| 3 | Two chaotic neutral [trolls](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/troll.md) in sleeveless vests strut up to the characters, eager to show off their matching tattoos, courtesy of the dabus Fell. |
| 4 | Pugdug, a kind-eyed orc [Bleak Cabal void soother](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bleak-cabal-void-soother-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"), offers to heal the characters, asking only that they pay the deed forward. |
| 5 | Two out-of-breath githzerai ratcatchers ([guards](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md)) in pink skullcaps chase a nimble [cranium rat squeaker](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/cranium-rat-squeaker-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). "Get 'em!" they cry as the rat darts toward the characters. |
| 6 | A droopy-eyed corpse collector (dwarf [commoner](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) in tattered clothing dumps a rotten body into the back of a wooden wagon. "If ye need a ride to the Mortuary, there's room in the back!" he laughs. |
| 7 | A thieving [musteval guardinal](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/musteval-guardinal-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") snatches a bag from a desperate human [commoner](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) and flees into a nearby alley. The victim cries for help from the characters. |
| 8 | Two [ettercaps](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ettercap.md) hiss at the characters from an abandoned tenement building cocooned in thick webbing. The building belongs to the Spite Spinners, a gang of arachnid bandits and their boss, a [darkweaver](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/darkweaver-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). |
