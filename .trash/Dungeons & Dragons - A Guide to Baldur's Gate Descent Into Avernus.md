This guide will hopefully help you navigate and successfully run Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus.

In certain cases, I’ve moved information around to keep it all in one spot. For example, I put all the Elfsong info in the same spot when running down the Elfsong Tavern scenario.

This document should serve as a nice way to get a head start on preparing the book or a glimpse to see if it is something you want to run.


1. Elturel has been pulled out of the Realms and into Avernus
2. Zariel is targeting Baldur’s Gate next
3. The heroes are trapped in Baldur’s Gate, as the city is trying to keep out refugees
4. Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard has gone missing - was on a diplomatic mission to Elturel
5. The Flaming Fist drafts the heroes. They must root out followers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul.
6. The group learns that the cultists are financed by Thalamra Vanthampur, one of the three dukes of Baldur’s Gate (and secret disciple of Zariel). She’s using money that she stole from Tiamat!
7. Thalamra’s plan is to sabotage the Flaming Fist and take over the city, so that it can be pulled into Avernus.
8. Thalamra has the Shield of the Hidden Lord, which is corrupting the city.
9. Thavius Kreeg, evil former ruler of Elturel, is hiding in the city. If slain, the group will run into him again in devil form (pg 132).
10. The heroes might liberate a spy linked to Sylvira Savikas, an expert on the Nine Hells.
11. Sylvira lives in Candlekeep. Her spies are trying to find the infernal contract Thavius signed, that doomed Elturel.
12. Sylvira can get the group to Avernus. Her friend, Traxigor, can cast plane shift.
13. In Avernus, the group gains a guide - a hollyphant named Lulu (who seems to have some kind of connection to Zariel)..
14. In Elturel, the group can ally with Ulder Ravengard.
15. To free Elturel, the group must either destroy “the Companion” or break the chains. Doing either will involve searching Avernus for the means to do so.
16. Lulu begins to remember things about the sword of Zariel. The sword can destroy the Companion.
17. The adventurers might cut a deal with Bel, former ruler of Avernus. They might also run afoul of Yeenoghu’s pet or meet Arkhan the Cruel.

**Summary by Character Level**Level 1

: The heroes join the Flaming Fist, find Tarina at the Elfsong Tavern, and defeat the pirates hunting her.

Level 2

: The group explores the dungeon under the bath house, meet Mortlock Vanthampur, and runs into some agents of Tiamat.

Level 3

: The adventurers go to Low Lantern to kill Amrik Vanthampur.

Level 4

: Then it's on to Vanthampur Villa where, hopefully, the adventurers accomplish three things:

1. They obtain the infernal puzzle box
2. They meet (and keep?) the Shield of the Hidden Lord
3. They meet a prisoner, Falaster Fisk, who can explain what is in the puzzle box and why it should be taken to Candlekeep.

Then, the group goes to Candlekeep, and meets Sylvira and Lulu. They are planeshifted to Elturel.

Level 5

: The heroes arrive in Elturel, which is chained to the Nine Hells. They go to High Hall and learn that Grand Duke Ravengard is in the cemetery.

Level 6

: The adventurers make their way through the cemetery, where Baphomet has demonic agents trying to gain a foothold. The group find Ravengard and must enact a ritual to separate him from the helm. Once done, he reveals that the sword of Zariel is the key to saving the city. Lulu knows that the trail to finding the sword begins at Fort Knucklebone.

Level 7

: At the fort, the group can solve a bunch of problems for Mad Maggie. Then, they go through a psychic ritual to unlock Lulu's memories.

Level 8

: After traveling to Haruman's Hill and battling Hellwasps, the heroes must choose one of two paths:

- **The Path of Demons**:
- **The Path of Devils**:

Level 9

:

Level 10

:

Level 11

: To get to the Bleeding Citadel, the adventurers must fight their way through The Scab, a crusted-over h### hill full of demons.

Level 12

: In the Bleeding Citadel is the Sword of Zariel.

Level 13

: All that is left to do is to figure out how to free Elturel - through redeeming or destroying Zariel as she fights a horde of demons while chains pull the city into the River Styx, most likely.

**The Hellriders**

The origin of the Hellriders go like this (see pg 44):

1. Demons linked to Yeenoghu were plaguing Elturel and Idyllglen.
2. The demons were actually using a portal situated in Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells.
3. Zariel, an angel, showed up to help on two occasions.
4. On the second occasion, Idyllglen was all but destroyed.
5. Zariel found the infernal gate and led a group of mortals through it to fight the devils on their home turf.
6. Zariel rode a golden Mastodon (!!).
7. Zariel was defeated and the remnants of her army returned to Elturel.
8. The survivors were celebrated and are known as the Hellriders.

**Background  (page 7)**

Long ago, the angel Zariel led a band of angelic soldiers into Avernus, wading into the Blood War (the eternal war between demons and devils). Some angels fled and went back to Mount Celestia. They are known as the Hellriders.

Zariel lost a hand. She ordered Yael, an ally, to take her sword and hide it. Yael fled with the hollyphant, Lulu.

Zariel and two generals, Olanthius and Haruman, were captured and sent to Nessus, the 9th level of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus welcomed her and gave her control of Avernus, supplanting Bel. Haruman became a narzugon. Olanthius killed himself, and rose up a a death knight.

Zariel felt betrayed by Elturel, and when the city was being threatened by a vampire, she made a contract with Thavius Kreeg. This contract caused a radiant sphere to appear over the city. Inside of it was a trapped planetar. This sphere is known as the Companion.  The light of the Companion drove out the vampire.

Thavius knew that the Companion would eventually shift. He fled the city and hid in Baldur’s Gate. The Companion transformed into an orb of negative energy and pulled Elturel into the Nine Hells.

The Nine Hells is Awful

: I really get a kick out of the idea that when a character does something selfish in the Nine Hells, they get inspiration (see pg 9). Make sure you’ve got the right players for something like that, though, as that one player will ruin it for everyone else.

Fireballs

: In older editions, fireballs would fall from the sky and sometimes track and target mortal intruders. In this book, it is said that pieces of the lost paradise that once was Avernus fall from the sky as burning meteors (pg 9). Finding a relic of the former paradise gives a fleeting feeling of joy.

Travel in Avernus

: The DM just decides how long it takes to get from one place to another. The Wandering Emporium (pg 126) can show up almost anywhere, at any time.

**Before You Start**Passive Perception

: Mark down everyone's passive perception scores (10+ their perception bonus. You'll need it once they get to Wyrm's Crossing (pg 44) and if you ask right before they cross that bridge, the players will know something is up.

Warn the Players

: You might want to tell the group that not everything is "scaled" to their level. They might run into some creatures too tough for them to beat. For example, if the group causes problems in Candlekeep, an archmage who casts 9th level spells will come over and mangle them (see "Candlekeep Defenses" on pg 46).

Come Up With Some H### Quests

: On page 78, the book notes that characters who fail a death save in Avernus can cut a deal with an archdevil in exchange for rolling a natural 20 on their next death save. The character will need to do the archdevil a "favor" in return. You might want to cook up some favors in advance.

Guard Reactions

: Keep the charts on page 163 in mind in case the group bumps into some guards during their time in Baldur's Gate. They seem fun.

Make a Plan

: Once the group gets to Avernus, you are going to have to figure out what encounters to use. The players will be choosing where to go, but you're still expected to place things like the Wandering Emporium, Smiler the Defiler, and other things where you like. You should most definitely sort through the encounters and try to plan out which should happen when. 

**Lulu the Hollyphant**

Lulu is a very important NPC who meets the group just before they travel to the Nine Hells. She sticks with them and slowly recovers her memories and spells.

Regaining Memories

: When you feel like it's the right time, roll on the chart on page 51.

Regaining Spells

: Regains light when the heroes arrive in Elturel (page 53)

If She Dies

: Check out page 139. If Lulu dies at some point in this adventure, she is brought back to life in the citadel.

Lulu's Origin

:

- Lulu can turn into a golden-furred war mammoth with wings
- She was friends with Zariel for centuries.
- When Zariel was defeated, she gave her sword to Yael to keep it safe.
- Yael and Lulu were chased by Yeenoghu’s pet
- Yael plunged the blade into a stone, Lulu created a fortress atound it that hedged out all evil.
- Lulu wandered Avernus alone and eventually ran into Mahadi of the Wandering Emporium. He splashed her with water from the River Styx.
- He gave Lulu to a group of devils, but Zariel had Lulu sent back to the Realms with her faculties somewhat restored.

**Chapter 1: A Tale of Two Cities (pg 10)**The Flaming Fist

: An army of mercenaries who work for Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard. Ravengard is an honorable man, but the Flaming Fist have been known to be cruel.

Ten days ago, Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard went to Elturel on a diplomatic mission. While he was there, Elturel was pulled into Avernus.

Thavius Kreeg, refugee from Elturel, is being sheltered by Duke Vanthampur. (pg 11)

**The Vanthampurs**

Family Motto

: "Stone Hearts Never Bleed" (pg 36)

The Vanthampur family is in debt to Zariel. She and her sons are trying to use the Shield of the Hidden Lord to doom Baldur’s Gate, and get it pulled into Avernus as well.

Information on the family can be found on pages 25-26, and pg 32.All of that content is summarized right here.

The family is paying Dead Three cultists to murder people in the city, to prove that the Flaming Fist can't do the job.

**Thalamra Vanthampur** (stat block on pg 38): Devil-worshiper, late 60's, strong,

- Wants to be the Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate.
- Orchestrated the disappearance of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard.
- **Slobberchops**: Her pet tressym (pg 241).
- She is a widow three times over. She had a son with each husband.

Her three sons:

- **Amrik (stat block on pg 30)**: Runs a moneylending business out of a tavern called the Low Lantern. Has 2 bodyguards - Kasharra (spined devil MM pg 78) and Vhaltus (thug MM pg 350). Is being groomed to be Thalamra's successor.
- **Thurstwell (stat block on pg 34)**: Uses imps as spies.Sickly, rarely leaves mother's estate.Has spies watching the bathhouse and at Low Tavern. He is jealous of Amrik.
- **Mortlock (stat block on pg 26)**: Amrik is quietly trying to off him. Thalamra doesn't like him and would disown him, but it was her third husband's dying wish that she look after him.

**Gargauth, The 10th Lord of the Nine**

The Shield of the Hidden Lord (pg 225) is apparently linked to an archdevil first described in older editions. Here is what Sylvira has to say about Gargauth (on pg 47):

- Gargauth was a pit fiend sent by Asmodeus to corrupt mortals on the Material Plane.
- Gargauth amassed a following to rival gods and became a sort of demi-god.

When I made Emirikol’s Guide to Devils, I dug up all the lore on Gargauth that I could find. Here it is:

In the early days of the Nine Hells, Gargauth lived in Nessus and was one of Asmodeus’s closest advisors. Gargauth realized that a member of the court named Astaroth was actually a demon and a minor deity in disguise. Astaroth had achieved the title Treasurer of H###, and fled after stealing a number of valuable secrets. The information he stole aids the demons in the Blood War to this day.

Asmodeus ordered Gargauth to hunt down Astaroth. Gargauth did so, defeating Astaroth and consuming his divine spark. Gargauth had acquired godly powers.

Gargauth spent time roaming the planes, utilizing his power to cast plane shift once every 9 days.

Appearance

: Gargauth often appears as an 8-foot-tall human with a mustache. He always has a poisonous snake wrapped around his arm.

Weakness

: He is vulnerable to silver. It is said that he was once almost killed by a mortal who threw a sack of silver pieces at him.

Current Whereabouts

: Prior to Descent Into Avernus, Gargauth was said to be trapped in the Wells of Darkness, an Abyssal prison plane that holds a number of powerful entities.

**Knights of the Shield**

The Knights of the Shield serve and protect the Shield of the Hidden Lord. Members include:

- **Lady Satiir Thione-Hhune (pg 40)**: Member of the Hhune patriar family, in her 70's.
- **Kaddrus (pg 44)**: A cambion (MM pg 36)
- **Falar (pg 44)**: A veteran (MM pg 350)
- **Zaroud al'Ryshal (pg 44)**: A veteran (MM pg 350)
- **Nulra Blacksaddle (pg 44)**: A veteran (MM pg 350)

The heroes should be level 5 when they get to Avernus.

**The Basilisk Gate pg 12**

Flaming Fist

: Very bribeable. 10 gp is enough to be allowed through the gate.

Captain Darmin Zodge

(veteran MM pg 350): Evil human trying to prove that he is worthy of running the Flaming Fist.

- Accompanied by 6 veterans (MM pg 350): Issio, Minaqua, Nelestree, Oliver, Soltus, and Thalkara.

Liara Portyr

: She runs Fort Beluarian in Chult, and she is on her way to Baldur’s Gate. Her uncle is Duke Dillard Portyr.

Meeting Captain Zodge (pg 12)

: Zodge gives the heroes a badge and asks them to kill any members of the Dead Three that they can find. Pay: 200 gp. He asks the group to seek out Tarina at the Elfsong Tavern.

Badges

: You might want to mention to the heroes that the badges give them access to Upper City, a gated-off area where the nobles live. This will come up when the group has to go to Vanthampur Villa later on (pg 31).

**Elfsong Tavern (pg 16)**

Zodge has spies watching the group. If the heroes don’t go to the Elfsong Tavern within 2 days, he sends 6 veterans (MM pg 350) and a flameskull (MM pg 134) after them.

Don’t Forget the Elfsong

: The tavern is haunted by a spirit that sings a song in Elvish every once in a while. On pg 18, there is a section called “Elfsong”. Usually the spirit sings about a lost love, but this time it sings about Elturel.

The group can learn that the Companion is the name of the artificial sun that hovered over Elturel. They can also learn about the Hellriders, the knights of Elturel, and how some of them actually rode into the Nine Hells on horseback to fight devils.

V36. Vanthampur Vault

: Door is locked (DEX check DC 15 to pick, Athletics DC 24 to force open). Duke Vanthampur has the key.

- **Important Things**: Don’t forget two things - Thavius’s shadow does not match his appearance, and the shield telepathically contacts a random character and claims it can help the group rescue Elturel.
- **Shield Hanging on the Wall**: Shield of the Hidden Lord (pg 225)
- The shield has a deal with Thavius and Vanthampur to spread corruption in the city, but it is happy to go back to the Nine Hells with the heroes instead.

**Thavius Kreeg (pg 42)**: The group might notice his shadow - it doesn’t match him. It looks like a pudgy, horned devil with wings.

- Lost his faith, still pretends to worship Torm.
- He has been talking to the shield, he thinks he can use it to pull Baldur’s Gate into Avernus.
- He pretends to be sad about what happened to Elturel.

**Final Encounters in Baldur’s Gate (pg 42**): Reya and Falaster will urge the group to bring the infernal puzzle box to Candlekeep. They’ll both want to come along.

**Reporting to Captain Zodge (pg 42)**: The heroes hand in their badges, and each of them receives a cool 200 gp. As they are talking, Captain Portyr arrives...

**Commander Portyr (pgs 42-43)**: She basically peer pressures the group into going to see Sylvira in Candlekeep to unlock the infernal puzzle box.

**Journey to Candlekeep (pg 43-44)**: Falaster Fisk will bring a book along that will grant the group access to the library of Candlekeep.

Make sure you know the group’s passive perception scores!

**Wyrm’s Crossing (pg 44)**: This is a crowded bridge, full of pickpockets. Ask the group to roll d20’s. Whoever gets the lowest result gets their pocket picked. Bandit (MM pg 343) doesn’t roll, if the character has an 11 passive perception or higher, the bandit fails. If not, the bandit succeeds and escapes.

**Knights of the Shield (pg 44)**: This only happens if the group has the Shield of the Hidden Lord. Hey look, it’s a farmer driving a hay cart. Wait! It’s a cambion with allies hidden in the hay! These people want to snatch the shield and return it to the Hhune family.

- 3 veterans (MM pg 350)

- The monks here preserve the prophecies of Alaundo the Seer.

**Entering Candlekeep (pg 46)**  
3 monks (priest MM pg 348) who worship Deneir request a gift - a book! - as payment for entry.  
If the group starts problems an archmage (MM pg 342) and 1d4 mages (MM pg 347) will come on over and mess the group up real bad. Casting time stop, mind blank or wall of force (DC 17) are nice ways to non-lethally stop the group’s shenanigans.

The Hearth (pg 46)

: A pub.

- **Little One**: An ogre (MM pg 237) who wears a headband of intellect (DMG pg 173). He is quiet and reads a lot.

Sylvira Savikas (pg 46

): She is a tiefling archmage (MM pg 342)

- **Jezebel**: Her quasit (MM pg 63) familiar.
- She easily opens the puzzle box and finds the infernal contract inside. It reveals that Thavius did indeed make a deal with Zariel. Reya is devastated by this news.
- If the group has the Shield of the Hidden Lord, she says it should be locked away in an extradimensional space. Gargauth quietly asks a character to take it to the Nine Hells.
- **Map**: If the group indicates they want to save Elturel, she gives them a map (unfold that poster map in the back of the book).
- **Getting to Avernus (pg 50)**: Sylvira tells the group that a wizard named Traxigor can cast plane shift to get the group to Elturel.
- **Research**: Spending a day or two in Candlekeep, the heroes can learn everything about the Nine Hells on pg 64-66 of the DMG and all of the lore in the MM from pages 66-77.
- **Travel to the Tower**: Sylvira lets them ride griffons (MM pg 174).

Traxigor’s Tower

: Traxigor is quite a character (archmage MM pg 342).

- **Lulu** (hollyphant pg 237)
- Traxigor can’t find his tuning fork. Highest perception check finds the fork, lowest finds a trinket (roll on the chart on PH pg 160).

Lulu the Hollyphant

:

- She will slowly regain her memories and powers as the adventure progresses. Right now, she cannot cast spells at all.
- She communicates telepathically
- Friendship with the heroes will cause her to slowly regain her memories.

*Dingle, the group hits level 5*.

**Chapter 2: Elturel Has Fallen**

Elturel:

- Tethered 500 feet above the River Styx.
- 8 chains bind the city to jagged posts of iron.
- The Companion still hovers above the city. It is dark and strikes the city with lightning every minute.
- Devils haven’t been able to overrun Elturel yet because demons are attacking on the ground below.
- Lulu regains the light spell.

: Reya offers to lead the group to High Hall, to find someone in charge. Gargauth wants the group to explore Avernus.

- **3 bearded devils (MM pg 70)**: Blass, Nodd, and Thunn.

- **If the Group Does Nothing**: The woman and her kids are captured and taken away to be sold into slavery.
- **Reya and Lulu**: Act regardless of what the group does.

Harkina can give the group some information:

- The city has been split in two.
- She was hoping to find safety in the High Hall.
- She thinks Thavius Kreeg is in the High Hall figuring out what to do.

If captured, a devil can reveal:

- The posts connected to the chains are slowly sinking, pulling the hovering city down toward the River Styx.
- The demon attack has stopped the devils from completing the task of dragging Elturel all the way down.
- The devil assumes Zariel was the one who did this.

- **The Tome of the Creed Resolute**: Lists everyone who took the oath. Remember back on page 47: “All persons bound by oath to defend Elturel are also considered forfeit.” So, this book lists every person whose soul belongs to Zariel under the terms of the infernal contract.
- **Holy Water Font**: You can fill up 50 vials!
- The group learns that Grand Duke Ravengard went to the cemetery looking for a magic item.

*Blam, the group hits 6th level.*

: A former priest of Lathander corrupted by Zariel.

Exploring the Cemetery (pg 66)

**Approaching the Chapel (pg 66)**  
3 minotaur skeletons (MM pg 273)

G1. Walk of Bravery

: Undead entities emerge from the pillars and attack. One specter stays in its pillar.

- 4 shadows (MM pg 269)
- 4 spectres (MM pg 279)
- The heroes can make history checks to remember the names, and then imbue the pillars with the power to damage the undead.

G2. Chapel of Light

: Minotaur skeletons try to charge and send heroes through partially-shattered stained glass windows.

- 4 minotaur skeletons (MM pg 273)

- Zombie (MM pg 316)
- Shadows (MM pg 269)
- Spectres (MM pg 279)
- Ghoul (MM pg 148)
- Ghast (MM pg 148)
- Wight (MM pg 300)
- Wraith (MM pg 302)

G7. Workshop

G8. Ossuary of the Faithful

: Yikes, the holy symbols are corrupted. Touch: CON sv DC 15, take 18 necrotic dmg, half on save.

G9. Main Ossuary

: The quasit here is invisible and loyal to Baphomet.

- **Ophurkh**: Quasit (MM pg 63)

G11. Vault of Honor

: This vault once held the Helm of Torm’s Sight. The human tracks pass through here.

G12. Vault of Ascendance

: Ulder Ravengard is here wearing the Helm of Torm’s Sight. He is locked in a psychic battle with Baphomet and can’t remove the helmet.

- **Helm of Torm’s Sight**: A non-magical item through which Torm can send visions. The helm won’t come off without the aid of a ritual. The power of the demonic portal here is tied to the helm.
- **Ulder Ravengard (pg 70)**: He is stunned until the helmet is removed.
- 3 minotaurs (MM pg 223)
- **Note**: You might want to flavor the psychic battle as Ulder being trapped in a psychic labyrinth, hunted by Baphomet. Baphomet, demon lord of minotaurs, specializes in mazes and this would be appropriate.

Escaping the Siege (pg 71)

: Now the group needs to remove the helm so that Ulder can tell communicate the visions Torm had sent him. The group should bring Ulder to Pherria (pg 64).

Ritual of Returning (pg 71)

: This needs to be done in H6 (pg 61).

1. Cleanse the altar as described on pg 61.
2. 1 creature must pray to Torm.
3. A powerful symbol is needed (the sword of the Unknown Hero pg 63).

Performing the Prayer

: Takes 30 seconds to recite. At the same time, 1 character must rest the sword on the helm and make a CON sv DC 11 at the end of each turn or take 10 (3d6 force damage). So that means that, since a round is 6 seconds, that character holding the sword will need to make 5 saving throws!

- **Round 1**: CON sv DC 11. Fail = 10 dmg. Also, 2 will o’ wisps (MM pg 301) appear and try to disrupt the ritual.
- **Rounds 2-5**: CON sv DC 11. Fail = 10 dmg.

**The Path Forward (pg 72)**: Ravengard says he saw Lulu create a fortress around a sword in the Nine Hells. Then she flew off and met bird creatures with a war machine.

Lulu remembers that it is the sword of zariel protected by the fortress, and that it is the key to saving Elturel. She remembers the birdfolk (kenku) - “Chukka” and “Clonk”, and that they took her to a place called Fort Knucklebone. She flies up and spots the fort in the distance.

Uldar and Reya want to stay in elturel while the group looks for the Sword of Zariel.

**Leaving Elturel (pg 72)**Climbing Down

: The city is 500 feet up. So, if a hero double moves, that’s 60 feet per round. Climbing costs 2 feet per 1 foot of movement, so that’s 30 feet per round. So, it will take around 16 rounds to climb down, or a bit under two minutes.

Every minute the group is on the chains, they must make a CON save DC 10. Fail: 10 necrotic dmg and make a DEX sv DC 10 or fall!

- Fall: Land in the River Styx (pg 76). Each round you are in the river, make an INT sv DC 20 or feeblemind (PH pg 239). Fail = take 4d6 psychic dmg, and you CHA and INT scores become 1. Can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate. This lasts for 30 days!

Improvised Equipment

: DC 10 checks.. Equipment works, might start to malfunction 50 feet from the bottom.

Battle of Elturel

: The devils are commanded by Lucille, Zariel’s most loyal pit fiend.

- Pit fiend (MM pg 77)
- 12 spined devils (MM pg 78)
- Helm of devil command (pg 223) and battle standard of infernal power (pg 223)

To Fort Knucklebone! It is 10 miles to the fort.

*Bagoom, the heroes hit 7th level.*

The poster map of Avernus in the book is for the players to refer to. Elturel and Fort Knucklebone are not on it.

What is Avernus?  

- Demons use the River Styx to enter Avernus.
- Avernus was once a plane of lush gardens.
- The devils of Avernus seek to exploit pride and wrath.
- Most devils in Avernus serve Zariel.
- **Visitors To Avernus**: War profiteers, mad wizards, slavers, etc.

Zariel’s War (pg 76)  

- Zariel wants as many mortal souls as possible so they can serve in her army.
- Bel, the former ruler of Avernus, is her advisor. He plots to overthrow her.
- Zariel is focused on fighting demons, just as she was when she was an angel.

Features of Avernus (pg 76)

**River Styx**: Each round you are in the river, make an INT sv DC 20 or feeblemind (PH pg 239). Fail = take 4d6 psychic dmg, and you CHA and INT scores become 1. Can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand language, or communicate. This lasts for 30 days!

Water taken from the River Styx retains its potency for 24 hours. Be real careful with this, I’ve had groups go nuts with this and it can get ugly. Remember that just getting the water out of the river isn’t easy - one drop can erase your memory.

**Alterations to Magic**

Cosmetic Spell Modification:  

- **Find Familiar (PH pg 240)**: It’s always an imp (MM pg 76). Or, if a character spots a spawning tree (see pg 96), they could summon an abyssal chicken (stats pg 97).
- **Find Steed (PH pg 240)**: It’s always a nightmare (MM pg 235), you lucky person.
- **Find the Path (PH pg 240)**: A complaining imp (MM pg 76) guides the caster.

Telepathic Communications:

Archdevils have the ability to eavesdrop on spells such as message and sending. Same with sending stones and helms of telepathy! A ring of mind shielding (DMG pg 191) protects you from this.

Demon Ichor (pg 78)  

- This goo is the remains of slain demons. Sometimes it collects in lakes or pools.
- Come in Contact: CON sv DC 10. Fail = Roll on the FLESH WARPING table on pg 78.
- You can coat your weapon in this stuff. It wears off after you hit with it once.
- A spell that removes a curse ends the warping effect.

Bargain-Basement Death Saves (pg 78)

: If you fail a death save, an archdevil might telepathically reach out to cut you a deal! Perform a simple task for them, and the next death save is a natural 20!

Exhaustion (pg 79)

: This is tough. Every hour that you walk through Avernus, you must make a CON save DC 10 (+1 per hour). Fail means you gain a level of exhaustion (PH pg 291).

Pervasive Evil (pg 79)

: At the end of a long rest, make a WIS sv DC 10. Fail: You become lawful evil. It becomes permanent if you don’t leave the plane within d4 days. Dispel evil and good gets rid of this effect, as does spending a day on another plane.

Using The Poster Map (pg 79)

: Distances are random and locations shift.

Charting a Course

: So, you roll two dice. If the dice turn up the same number, then the group ends up at a different location than the one they were trying to get to.

- **2d4**: Traveling to new locale
- **2d8**: Locale they’ve been to before
- **2d10**: A native guide is leading them there.

**Fort Knucklebone (pg 80)**: A junkyard stronghold in a desolate area ravaged by rival gangs of scavengers called the Knucklebones. Lulu thinks the kenku live here.

Leader

: Mad Maggie Night Hag warlord Zariel leaves her alone as long as Maggie keeps the other warlords in check.

Arrival at the Fort

: This negotiation is going to be handled loosely. You should quietly rank how things are going on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best (and 10 meaning the group gets everything they want).

Entering the Fort

: 6 redcaps (pg 240) demand the password, then remember there is no password.

Seeing the Kenku

: Chukka & Clonk (kenku MM pg 194). Known as “The Magpies”. They are trying to repair a war machine (demon grinder stats pg 219). Helping the Kenku: Spend 10 minutes, make an Arcana or Investigation check DC 15: Realize there’s a gear causing the problem. Fix it: dispel magic, protection from evil, etc.

- **Clonk**: Big. Strong and silent. Klonk has a hellfire warhammer +2 to hit, 4 bludge. (heelfire is on pg 223 - if you are killed by hellfire, your soul goes to the Nine Hells and you become a lemure!)
- **Chukka**: Animated, irritable, does repairs. Wields a silvered pike +2 to hit, 5 piercing dmg.

  
Mad Maggie (MM pg 178)

: She can unlock Lulu’s memories, but she needs to gather supplies for the ritual.

- She is obsessed with Zariel and collects relics relating to her - this is why she is so interested in unlocking Lulu’s memories.
- Offers: She can give the group 1 or more war machines, food, water

Mickey the Flesh Golem (fiendish flesh golem pg 236)

: He can’t speak and walks weirdly. Insight check DC 15: Mickey has a piece of a bone devil lodged in his foot.

Pins and Needles

: Imps (MM pg 76). Often assume the form of ravens. Spy on Maggie's rivals.

Barnabus the Flameskull

- Problem: A redcap stole one of his teeth.
- Help: Perception Check DC 11: The redcaps have it and pass it to each other - to them it is a good luck charm. Sleight of Hand DC 14 - the heroes can steal it back.

Redcaps and Madcaps

: There are 60 redcaps and 30 madcaps here. They love and fear Mad Maggie.  
Stats on pg 240

- Redcap: Fey that soak their hats in fresh blood.
- Madcaps: Soak their hats in demon ichor.

Mad Maggie’s Infernal War Machines (pg 84)

: 2 war machines are relatively intact - Devil’s Ride and Tormentor (stats pg 94).

- Tormentor: Missing its harpoon flinger, AC 15 due to corroded armor (need scrap metal to repair).
- Devil’s Ride: Wheels are missing.

Lulu’s Dream Quest (pg 85)

: The ritual goes like this:

- Maggie makes a fiendish circle, puts black cushions in the center. Lulu must rest on the cushions. Maggie places the two skulls of her sisters on the circle.
- The characters must also take places in the circle.
- Takes ten minutes.
- Characters should keep their eyes closed. Everyone will have a telepathic bond.

Dreamscape

: Take psychic dmg from other dream-creatures. 0 hit points = unable to proceed to the next dream. If all characters fall unconscious, it ends and they have to start over.

**Dream 1: Rainbow Angels**

- INT save DC 10. Success = proceed to next dream. If EVERYONE fails = 11 psychic dmg, attempt save again. Only 1 character needs to succeed for everyone to move on.

**Dream 2: Betrayal**

- 6 spined devils (MM pg 78)
- Once 3 devils are dropped to 0 HP, the heroes can move on.

**Dream 4: Desolation**

Lulu leads the group to Haruman’s Hill (pg 92) and then realizes the group needs to choose one of two paths: The path of demons (flowchart pg 96) or the path of devils (flow chart pg 106).

**Haruman’s Hill (pg 92)**

Knights impaled on iron trees: Deserters. They abandoned Zariel during her assault on Avernus.  
Haruman: Human paladin of Helm. If the group tries to free them, 2d4 stirges attack.

Stirges (MM pg 284) suck blood from them, and feed the blood to the impaled vampire at the top of the hill (Jander Sunstar).

- A place where demons manifest (pg 96)
- A place where demons are destroyed (pg 106)

**Hellwasp Nest (pg 95)**

- Krikendolt: A bearded devil with a brain injury obtained while fighting a vrock.
- Earwax: An abyssal chicken he keeps secretly in his sack.

Tower of Urm (pg 97)

: Mordenkainen (archmage MM pg 342).

- This tower can travel between planes.
- Mercenaries: 9 mezzoloths (MM pg 313), 3 nycaloths (MM pg 314)

- What Else He Knows: On page 100 it reveals that Ubbalux knows where the crypt of the Hellriders (pg 101) is, that a death knight guards it, and what the password to enter is (“For Glory”).

Mirror of Mephistar

:

- Giant Slab of Ice: See your reflection warped: INT save DC 20 or stunned 1 minute. Mephistopheles gains access to thoughts, fears, knowledge.

- The terms are etched onto the ice. The group must chisel them off and drink them.
- An imp (MM pg 76) with shattersticks (pg 99) appears. Shattersticks do 35 dmg to all structures in a 20-foot-radius. It can lead the group to the Pit of Shummrath.
- Development: If Mephistopheles learns about the group’s quest, he will eventually send an ice devil (MM pg 75) to kill them and steal the Sword of Zariel.

Pit of Shummrath (pg 100)

:

- The pool is the liquid remains of a pit fiend (MM pg 77) merged with the river styx.
- Cage: Hanging over it is an ultroloth (MM pg 314) in a cage.
- Baazit: Ultroloth bound by dimensional shackles (pg 165). Was imprisoned for stealing soul coins. The cage is lowered periodically and almost drowns the ultroloth before rising back up.

- Make a Homunculus: Spend 1 hour forming it. Homunculus (MM pg 188).

Damming the Styx:

- The imp starts setting up the shattersticks.
- 8 spined devils (MM pg 78) attack.
- 1 minute later, explosion.
- 48 hours later: Shummrath reforms and becomes a pit fiend (MM pg 77) once more. He will fly off to wage war on Bel once more.

Ubbalux will reluctantly swear fealty to Mephistopheles (a demon swearing loyalty to an archdevil!? All sorts of weird stuff could come from this, especially because demons don’t keep their word).

Crypt of the Hellriders (pg 102)

: The idea here is that the group explores the crypt, takes a short rest, reads the journals and realizes Olanthius is actually sort of a good guy. Then Olanthius shows up and asks the group to distract Zariel.

C1. Sealed Gates

: Open: password is “For Glory”. Can use magic to get through.

C2. Funerary Chambers

- Yael knows where the Sword of Zariel is.

Olanthius Returns (pg 103)

: Death knight (MM pg 47), 2 gorgons (MM pg 171). He will turn the 3 ghosts into specters (MM pg 279)

So, get this. The demon lord Kostchtchie is trapped here on Avernus. Zariel took his weapon. Olanthius wants the group to free Kostchtchie (!).

Arches of Ulloch (pg 103)

- Return to Olanthius: He reveals that the group must meet with Yael in the Bleeding Citadel (pg 134).

**Path of Devils (pg 106)**Demon Zapper (pg 106)

: The unicorn is trapped in a sphere that blocks magic and physical entry. Any fiend that gets within 100 feet of this thing is pretty much dead: DEX sv DC 18 260 radiant dmg, half on save.

- Guardian: Ralzala, a dao who regrets making a pact with Zariel. Ralzala will try to get the group to help her break her pact. To do so, the heroes must visit Red Ruth in the Bone Brambles (pg 107)

Helping Ralazala

: Once she’s back from the spa, Red Ruth says that the dao must drink the blood of a titan

**Uldrak’s Grave (pg 109)**

- Chango (manticore MM pg 213)
- Torogar (pg 112)
- Vial of Blood: Arkhan will trade the vial of blood for the sacrifice of a good-aligned creature - possibly Lulu or the unicorn. These sacrifices feed the Hand of Vecna, which is slowly corrupting him.
- Using the Blood: Uldrak splashes the vial at his feet He transforms into a lawful evil empyrean (MM pg 130). He takes his sword, gives the group a gallon of his blood, and plane shifts to [Surtur’s](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Surtur) home.

- The group must retrieve 9 stolen adamantium rods. In exchange, he’ll tell them how to get to the Bleeding Citadel. Finding the rods involves questioning a captured Sibriex, and he even offers them use of a barge to traverse the River Styx.
- The group won’t know: The nine rods unlock the Companion, which has a planetar (MM pg 17) trapped inside of it.
- If the group accepts, he sends an imp (MM pg 76) named Balakros with them.

Interrogating the Sibriex

: It communicates telepathically, offering to help the group if they free it. Insight check DC 17, it is lying. It knows that the adamantine rods are in a wrecked flying fortress. Balakros the imp knows where the fortress is.

Freeing the Sibriex

: Breaking three chains will do it. AC 19 HP 33 dmg threshold 10  
Remember, damage threshold means that you have to do at least 10 dmg to do any damage at all to the chains.

**Wrecked Flying Fortress (pg 118)**

The rods that the group are looking for are in a safe in area W5.

Fire Storm

: If for some reason the group is on foot, group Survival check DC 20. Fail means a firestorm blows in and attaches itself to a character for one minute. DEX save DC 20, 44 fire damage, half on save. Dispel magic (PH pg 234) shuts it down.

**Other Locations (pg 122)**

**Stygian Dock (pg 123)**

Note

: Having Zariel's flying fortress (pg 130) at a dock is something the book seems to want to happen. Almost none of the crew is on board when her fortress is docked (see pg 130).

Highest DEX check wins and that character gets a soul coin (pg 225). Up to 4 heroes can fit inside. It is definitely OK if some characters don’t want to go down there.

While the heroes are submerged, 10 vrocks (MM pg 64) attack the dock.

- Asmodeus will turn a character into a tiefling (!).(Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes pg 21: “The tieflings connected to Nessus command the power of fire and darkness, guided by a keener than normal intellect, as befits those linked to Asmodeus himself.

- Zariel will want the souls of good-aligned clerics and paladins 10th level or higher.

It is surrounded by a 10-foot thick of magical darkness. It has 9 locks, opened with the 9 rods from Zariel’s wrecked fortress (pg 118).

Shattering the Companion

: Striking the orb with the Sword of Zariel will shatter it and dispel the darkness. This frees the planetar trapped inside.

- The sword might shatter, unless wielded by a high-ranking angel or a good-aligned cleric or paladin level 10+.

**Appendix A Notes: Diabolical Deals**  

- Lemures & nupperibos can’t make deals.
- Other devils can make deals for themselves or for archdevils. Can’t normally make deals outside their home plane unless a devil talisman or ritual circle is involved.
- Archdevils can deal freely with mortals.

Contact an Archdevil

: Kill a chaotic or good-aligned creature and pray to the archdevil for one hour.

Proposal

: Devil offers gift, character offers price (usually their soul). Seal the deal with a contract.

- Charisma checks don’t work on devils in these situations.
- Devils can try a Deception vs Insight to deceive characters.
- Devils try to slip in extra clauses. Investigation vs. the devil’s Deception check to detect. The character must beat the devil’s roll, not tie it.

I'll have more up later today! I ran a special Avernus game on youtube - the group tried to get the orb of dragonkind from Uldrak's Grave before Arkhan the Cruel did:
