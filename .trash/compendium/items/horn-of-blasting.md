# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous item, major, rare*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `5d6` thunder damage and is [deafened](TTRPG/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [deafened](TTRPG/rules/conditions.md#Deafened). Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take `10d6` thunder damage instead of `5d6`.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `10d6` fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
