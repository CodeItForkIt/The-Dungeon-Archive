# Dagger of Venom

- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](TTRPG/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](TTRPG/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](TTRPG/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `2d10` poison damage and become [poisoned](TTRPG/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
