# Potion of Invisibility
*Potion, minor, very rare*  


This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [invisible](TTRPG/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is [invisible](TTRPG/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
