## Traits

***Keen Smell.*** The rat has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The rat has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the rat's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (`1d6`) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
