## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Special Equipment.*** The drow wears a +1 chain shirt and carries a +1 shortsword. These items lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md)

## Actions

***+1 Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) while [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
